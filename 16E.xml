The other thing that made me interested is the director, Antony Szeto, cause I saw his first film Dragon Blade in the theaters. Dragon Blade was a kid's computer animated film but the martial arts action in it is far more superior to the jumping around camera shots used for the fights in Kung Fu Panda. And Dragon Blade had a well thought out story to it, unlike the run of the mill production-line senseless stories that have been coming out of Hong Kong over the last ten/fifteen years. In Wushu, the director again gives us something unexpected, and again a well thought out story. As a family film it has something for everyone and I enjoyed myself throughout it. The story of the kids growing up in a poor single parent family is both touching and current, and I thought the way wushu as a sport was presented was very smart. Sammo Hung's performance as the father and teacher was surprisingly good... he should have got an award for it! Though the fight scenes in it don't number enough to satisfy the die hard action over all else fans, the main fight scene where Sammo comes up against the main bad guy is fantastic edge of the seat stuff. All in all, I laughed at the fun parts, was touched by the father-son relationship, was excited by the action, and amazed by the skills. This film was all out good entertainment... and in the end isn't that what we all pay to watch a film for?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":723,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-10-23","keywords":"wushu,kidnapping,school,martial arts,violence","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Jackie Chan Presents: Wushu","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4013360153","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3MjgwNTcyMzJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA5NTE3MzMx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3MjgwNTcyMzJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA5NTE3MzMx._V1_.jpg","description":"Jackie Chan Presents: Wushu"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005033/","name":"Sammo Kam-Bo Hung"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2908302/","name":"Fengchao Liu"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2508913/","name":"Wenjie Wang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0844038/","name":"Antony Szeto"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133530/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150586/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0150862/","name":"Dennis Chan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210118/","name":"Ho-Leung Lau"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The other thing that made me interested is the director, Antony Szeto, cause I saw his first film Dragon Blade in the theaters. Dragon Blade was a kid's computer animated film but the martial arts action in it is far more superior to the jumping around camera shots used for the fights in Kung Fu Panda. And Dragon Blade had a well thought out story to it, unlike the run of the mill production-line senseless stories that have been coming out of Hong Kong over the last ten/fifteen years. In Wushu, the director again gives us something unexpected, and again a well thought out story. As a family film it has something for everyone and I enjoyed myself throughout it. The story of the kids growing up in a poor single parent family is both touching and current, and I thought the way wushu as a sport was presented was very smart. Sammo Hung's performance as the father and teacher was surprisingly good... he should have got an award for it! Though the fight scenes in it don't number enough to satisfy the die hard action over all else fans, the main fight scene where Sammo comes up against the main bad guy is fantastic edge of the seat stuff. All in all, I laughed at the fun parts, was touched by the father-son relationship, was excited by the action, and amazed by the skills. This film was all out good entertainment... and in the end isn't that what we all pay to watch a film for?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":723,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-10-23","keywords":"wushu,kidnapping,school,martial arts,violence","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Jackie Chan Presents: Wushu","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4013360153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3MjgwNTcyMzJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA5NTE3MzMx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3MjgwNTcyMzJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA5NTE3MzMx._V1_.jpg","description":"Jackie Chan Presents: Wushu","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005033/","name":"Sammo Kam-Bo Hung","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2908302/","name":"Fengchao Liu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2508913/","name":"Wenjie Wang"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0844038/","name":"Antony Szeto"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133530/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150586/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0150862/","name":"Dennis Chan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210118/","name":"Ho-Leung Lau"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's really unusual, as the novel is. It's generally difficult to convey something like a SMELL in a book or a movie, and it's also difficult to create a satisfying adaption of a novel. So my personal opinion is that The Parfume Movie is one of the few good adaptations, because it eagerly tries to convey the complicated world of smells and the world of Grenouille and also achieves it in many ways. There are of course some parts missing or changed if you compare novel and movie, but that is always the case with adaptations.\n\nI saw the movie one hour ago and have just read some comments. Some of them are "disappointed" or "boooring", but most of these opinions are really not well founded, so I couldn't make out what EXACTLY was so boring and disappointing... However, I'll keep on dwelling in the magic of the movie, looking forward to other more positive comments...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":242174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2007-04-11","keywords":"18th century,smell,scent,perfume,sense of smell","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4003135769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxYzE3ZTAtMTg0MC00MzlhLTgwZTEtNzBmNjkyZjBmZTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxYzE3ZTAtMTg0MC00MzlhLTgwZTEtNzBmNjkyZjBmZTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0924210/","name":"Ben Whishaw"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000163/","name":"Dustin Hoffman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000614/","name":"Alan Rickman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040938/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0319096/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001949/","name":"Andrew Birkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0251536/","name":"Bernd Eichinger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"}],"duration":"PT2H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's really unusual, as the novel is. It's generally difficult to convey something like a SMELL in a book or a movie, and it's also difficult to create a satisfying adaption of a novel. So my personal opinion is that The Parfume Movie is one of the few good adaptations, because it eagerly tries to convey the complicated world of smells and the world of Grenouille and also achieves it in many ways. There are of course some parts missing or changed if you compare novel and movie, but that is always the case with adaptations.\n\nI saw the movie one hour ago and have just read some comments. Some of them are "disappointed" or "boooring", but most of these opinions are really not well founded, so I couldn't make out what EXACTLY was so boring and disappointing... However, I'll keep on dwelling in the magic of the movie, looking forward to other more positive comments...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":242174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2007-04-11","keywords":"18th century,smell,scent,perfume,sense of smell","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4003135769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxYzE3ZTAtMTg0MC00MzlhLTgwZTEtNzBmNjkyZjBmZTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxYzE3ZTAtMTg0MC00MzlhLTgwZTEtNzBmNjkyZjBmZTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0924210/","name":"Ben Whishaw","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000163/","name":"Dustin Hoffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000614/","name":"Alan Rickman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040938/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0319096/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001949/","name":"Andrew Birkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0251536/","name":"Bernd Eichinger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"],"duration":"PT2H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The story gets better every time you watch it, pay attention to even the smallest details like the color of the mysterious girl's socks, there is a good reason why Corso has a shoulder bag and an overcoat he never seems to part from, until the 'notorious' very last scene; shoulder bag and overcoat are gone...

His only company throughout this sojourn has been that of Gerty, the base's HAL-like robot voiced by Kevin Spacey. Unfortunately, the final weeks and days are proving to be the most difficult, and Sam finds himself going a bit squirrelly, leaving both he and the audience to wonder if what's unfolding is actually happening, or merely a drama taking place in his addled mind.\n\nThat's about as much plot detail as I'm going to deliver, for to delve any deeper into the story would give too much away. Be prepared, however, for a thought provoking narrative that touches on issues such as scientific ethics, corporate greed, human identity, and compassion.\n\nThere are no aliens, lasers/phasers, wormholes, warp engines or jump drives here, just a lonely space age concierge, an unflappable monotone robot, and a whole lot of fodder for your brain to chow down on.\n\nThis is what science fiction was meant to be.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":347192,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-07-10","keywords":"moon,solitude,memory,cult film,human clone","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Moon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1265108249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhhNzE4NjEtMGIyZC00MDBiLTk0ZGMtY2ZhNjFkMWEwN2VkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhhNzE4NjEtMGIyZC00MDBiLTk0ZGMtY2ZhNjFkMWEwN2VkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this sci-fi movie"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000228/","name":"Kevin Spacey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1069800/","name":"Dominique McElligott"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1512910/","name":"Duncan Jones"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014453/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0222021/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232575/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1512910/","name":"Duncan Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2914162/","name":"Nathan Parker"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The other thing that made me interested is the director, Antony Szeto, cause I saw his first film Dragon Blade in the theaters. Dragon Blade was a kid's computer animated film but the martial arts action in it is far more superior to the jumping around camera shots used for the fights in Kung Fu Panda. And Dragon Blade had a well thought out story to it, unlike the run of the mill production-line senseless stories that have been coming out of Hong Kong over the last ten/fifteen years. In Wushu, the director again gives us something unexpected, and again a well thought out story. As a family film it has something for everyone and I enjoyed myself throughout it. The story of the kids growing up in a poor single parent family is both touching and current, and I thought the way wushu as a sport was presented was very smart. Sammo Hung's performance as the father and teacher was surprisingly good... he should have got an award for it! Though the fight scenes in it don't number enough to satisfy the die hard action over all else fans, the main fight scene where Sammo comes up against the main bad guy is fantastic edge of the seat stuff. All in all, I laughed at the fun parts, was touched by the father-son relationship, was excited by the action, and amazed by the skills.

I never thought In my wildest dreams that I would be standing behind this film, sticking up for it opposed to slandering it with the rest. I actually went to see it for a laugh and so what if there were a half dozen beautiful girls flaunting there stuff right? well the first 10 minutes kinda made me think I was gonna be dead right, but not entirely. Sure it was a very poor excuse for a plot, but the action was really quite good. Before I get into that I need to make a remark, a lot of people have been slandering this movie because of it's story line, fair enough, but if you say that it doesn't make sense, you must be one thick chimpanzee, The story is so linear it hurts, and very, I repeat VERY easy to understand! Back to the movie. The acting was fine, I was especially pleased at Holly's Performance, A perfect role for her I would say, if Anyone's ever seen any of her film clips\n\nPlot: Pro-wrestler Tina (Jaime Pressly), master thief Christie (Holly Valance), and ninja princess Kasumi (Devon Aoki) are competitors in a martial arts tournament with a $10 million prize.\n\nThat pretty much sums up the basis of the plot haha but yeah. Good Action, Hot Girls, a worth while watch. Oh and another thing, Sarah Carter who starred in 3 episodes of Smallville plays another butt kickin' Babe, very sexy. It was kind of refreshing be able to watch a movie where the plot wasn't really a problem at all, all you had to do was focus on what was going on, no having to think about how this person knows this person and why they want to kill each other. It was also good to see a 'Girl Power' Flick which wasn't cheesy in the way that Charlie's Angels was, yeah it was cheesy in other ways, but none of that, "come on angels, let's go get 'em" All in all a good watch, I just hope they don't try and do a sequel *sighs* and IF they do, I hope they get a damn script writer!!!!\n\n7 Stars","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44297,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2007-02-14","keywords":"based on video game,legs crossed,gagged,blonde woman,movie flop","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"DOA: Dead or Alive","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi128057625","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2IyZmFmYWItMzM3OC00ZTU4LWFjNDAtZDcyYmFlMWE3OWQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2IyZmFmYWItMzM3OC00ZTU4LWFjNDAtZDcyYmFlMWE3OWQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Weinstein Co."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005326/","name":"Jaime Pressly"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1226817/","name":"Devon Aoki"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0141931/","name":"Sarah Carter"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477035/","name":"Corey Yuen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103774/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0493369/","name":"J.F.

I never thought In my wildest dreams that I would be standing behind this film, sticking up for it opposed to slandering it with the rest. I actually went to see it for a laugh and so what if there were a half dozen beautiful girls flaunting there stuff right? well the first 10 minutes kinda made me think I was gonna be dead right, but not entirely. Sure it was a very poor excuse for a plot, but the action was really quite good. Before I get into that I need to make a remark, a lot of people have been slandering this movie because of it's story line, fair enough, but if you say that it doesn't make sense, you must be one thick chimpanzee, The story is so linear it hurts, and very, I repeat VERY easy to understand! Back to the movie. The acting was fine, I was especially pleased at Holly's Performance, A perfect role for her I would say, if Anyone's ever seen any of her film clips\n\nPlot: Pro-wrestler Tina (Jaime Pressly), master thief Christie (Holly Valance), and ninja princess Kasumi (Devon Aoki) are competitors in a martial arts tournament with a $10 million prize.\n\nThat pretty much sums up the basis of the plot haha but yeah. Good Action, Hot Girls, a worth while watch. Oh and another thing, Sarah Carter who starred in 3 episodes of Smallville plays another butt kickin' Babe, very sexy. It was kind of refreshing be able to watch a movie where the plot wasn't really a problem at all, all you had to do was focus on what was going on, no having to think about how this person knows this person and why they want to kill each other. It was also good to see a 'Girl Power' Flick which wasn't cheesy in the way that Charlie's Angels was, yeah it was cheesy in other ways, but none of that, "come on angels, let's go get 'em" All in all a good watch, I just hope they don't try and do a sequel *sighs* and IF they do, I hope they get a damn script writer!!!!\n\n7 Stars","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44297,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2007-02-14","keywords":"based on video game,legs crossed,gagged,blonde woman,movie flop","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"DOA: Dead or Alive","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi128057625","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2IyZmFmYWItMzM3OC00ZTU4LWFjNDAtZDcyYmFlMWE3OWQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2IyZmFmYWItMzM3OC00ZTU4LWFjNDAtZDcyYmFlMWE3OWQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Weinstein Co.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005326/","name":"Jaime Pressly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1226817/","name":"Devon Aoki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0141931/","name":"Sarah Carter"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477035/","name":"Corey Yuen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103774/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0493369/","name":"J.F.

Many people didn't like this motion picture because of its liberal subtext.  That doesn't make it a bad film.  Most people don't realize that this was a Canadian production and that probably explains the political slant.  However, as action films go, it was intelligent, high tech, stimulating, bordering on believable (seldom are action flicks actually believable), with plenty of violence.  I didn't particularly agree with its `New World Order' message, but it was still a solid film.\n\nThe main criticism I have of the film is the editing.  In an attempt to make the story more intriguing, it is pasted together in a convoluted way that makes it very difficult to follow.  All the factions and motivations are eventually explained, but one has to pay very close attention or see the movie a few times to catch them all.  The screenplay suffers from an excess of subplots, which makes following the story that much more difficult.  The biggest sin committed by the producers and director was that they did not understanding their audience.  This film targets action lovers, who are a visceral lot.  They want to be stimulated, not confused and intrigued.  They also tend to be more conservative politically (God, Guns, Guts).  So naturally, the film bombed.\n\nWesley Snipes delivers a strong performance in the intelligent action hero role.  Snipes seems to be locked in the action genre when he is really too bright for the roles he plays.  He should take a lesson from Samuel L. Jackson and look for scripts that are more dramatic.  Jackson still does action films (Shaft), but he picks parts portraying complex characters and scripts with strong character development, instead of straight macho testosterone parts.  Snipes would have done well in some of the roles Jackson has had.  Anne Archer does a fine job as the manipulative career diplomat, pulling everyone's strings behind the scenes.  Donald Sutherland is a bit flaccid in this film, but his character really didn't have a lot of bite.\n\nOverall, this film is a strong entry into a genre dominated by mindless body count.  I rated it an 8/10.  Those who like their action flicks to be completely believable subtract two points.  Subtract another two points for those who don't like confounding story lines.  For those who abhor screen violence, don't even bother.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29534,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-08-25","keywords":"hero murders a woman,nude wears eyeglasses,fbi federal bureau of investigation,motor vehicle,car","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Art of War","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1820918041","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhZjllMDUtODkzYi00NTc0LTg0YTctMTFjNTljY2ZiYWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhZjllMDUtODkzYi00NTc0LTg0YTctMTFjNTljY2ZiYWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000648/","name":"Wesley Snipes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000271/","name":"Anne Archer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001999/","name":"Maury Chaykin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240995/","name":"Christian Duguay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033472/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043393/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078451/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0063511/","name":"Wayne Beach"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0058164/","name":"Simon Barry"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Francuska serija pod nazivom "Profileri" predstavlja Chloé, kriminalističku psihologinju koja istražuje ubojice kako bi pomogla riješiti slučajeve zločina. Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

Hopefully this will be a good calling card for him to get more work, or for more of his comics to reach the screen. While he's usually known for his spin on Captain America, he also has a series of hard-hitting hard-boiled comics called 'Criminal' (at the moment, I think, there's three volumes in all). Angel of Death follows along on the heels of those latter comics, and what he delivers here with this script is like an updating of a pulpy story that might have been found back in the 1950s put to film - only, of course, far less violent and expletive or on occasion trippy. It's like a Sin City yarn if it took itself not quite as much as a parody. And it works, mostly.\n\nAnd another good thing about it, with its story about a hit-woman (Zoe Bell) who after getting a knife stabbed in her head and surviving- and becoming a loose cannon and seeing visions of a young girl she accidentally killed "telling her" to hit the entire mob organization around her- is that it leads on tough-movie dialog, kick-ass fight scenes and a really superb leading lady. Previously one could see Bell as a stunt-woman in Kill Bill or as herself, sorta, in Death Proof. But here she proves she can hold her own in dramatic scenes (maybe not quite her Uma Thurman counterpart but close enough) and seeing her fight is really extraordinary.\n\nIn fact, if you're just looking for a better-than-average direct-to-DVD action flick that chalks up a load of mob-movie/detective clichés, and don't know or care about Brubaker's name on the DVD, it's still worth watching. The fights are gritty and realistic, and the direction compliments these moments of torrid psycho-drama with Bell's knack for knocking someone's head in or any other kind of clever way of killing at a moment's notice. The film sometimes goes into a comic-book-panel kind of mis-en-scene, like if Zoe Bell's character is in a room walking around we'll see three different 'panels' of this. It's creative, if a little overused (and not so original if one's seen Ang Lee's Hulk). And, as a more obvious complaint, with the exception of Doug Jones and Lucy Lawless most of the cast is just 'meh', not terrible but nothing special.\n\nBut pick it up if you're roving around your video rental or if netflix gives the recommendation. You'll be surprised how much 78 minutes can go in delivering a hard-knock story of hard kills and harder consequences.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2276,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-07-07","keywords":"death in title,body lands on a car,knocked unconscious,assassin,mob","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Angel of Death","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1030208281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDM5NWQ5Y2MtNTI2Ny00YTRiLWFlNWMtMTYxM2I2YWY1MDA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDM5NWQ5Y2MtNTI2Ny00YTRiLWFlNWMtMTYxM2I2YWY1MDA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1057928/","name":"Zoë Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1831976/","name":"Jake Abel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2357552/","name":"Vail Bloom"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0262049/","name":"Paul Etheredge"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0178127/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3090268/","name":"Ed Brubaker"}],"duration":"PT1H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's one of those movies I've passed over many times, despite my love for Colin Firth, because reviews were so low. Finally, Redbox sold out of anything better, I gave it a try and now I'm so glad I did.\n\nIf you're looking for Oceans 11 or The Italian Job type intricacies in the plot, it isn't going to happen. However, it's still cute and interesting with enough of a twist to be worth it. Where this show really shines is in the hilarious writing - the insults and comments are really really funny - and in the acting abilities of Colin Firth and Alan Rickman. Both do tremendous jobs. Colin Firth can take impossibly stupid situations, the kind Steve Martin and Ben Stiller do, situations almost painful in how absurd and moronic they are, and yet he makes them hilarious. A guy on a hotel ledge several stories up, no pants, is old old old, but Colin Firth makes it remarkably entertaining, as if this is the first time you've ever seen that scenario in a movie. Alan Rickman plays a SOB like no one else and he's the total jerk you love anyway (think his Sheriff of Nottingham role) because he's just so good at it and his muttered comments and blatant insults keep you busting out in laughs. I got to the point I was jotting down some of the lines in the show, and thinking I may need to go back to the beginning to write down others, because they're absurd, clever, and all-together brilliant.\n\nIf you need lots of intricate plot twists and details - maybe not for you. If you enjoy understated yet remarkably hilarious verbal humor, witty comeback, diverting insult and repartee, ridiculous colloquialisms and a few side-splitting guffaws, this is the show for you.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24285,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2013-02-13","keywords":"painting,heist,art forgery,cigar smoking,man wears eyeglasses","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1614521369","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzcxODM1MjMwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTEzMzYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzcxODM1MjMwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTEzMzYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An art curator decides to seek revenge on his abusive boss by conning him into buying a fake Monet, but his plan requires the help of an eccentric and unpredictable Texas rodeo queen."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000614/","name":"Alan Rickman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001355/","name":"Michael Hoffman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0326645/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362381/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251858/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0140987/","name":"Sidney Carroll"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's one of those movies I've passed over many times, despite my love for Colin Firth, because reviews were so low. Finally, Redbox sold out of anything better, I gave it a try and now I'm so glad I did.\n\nIf you're looking for Oceans 11 or The Italian Job type intricacies in the plot, it isn't going to happen. However, it's still cute and interesting with enough of a twist to be worth it. Where this show really shines is in the hilarious writing - the insults and comments are really really funny - and in the acting abilities of Colin Firth and Alan Rickman. Both do tremendous jobs. Colin Firth can take impossibly stupid situations, the kind Steve Martin and Ben Stiller do, situations almost painful in how absurd and moronic they are, and yet he makes them hilarious. A guy on a hotel ledge several stories up, no pants, is old old old, but Colin Firth makes it remarkably entertaining, as if this is the first time you've ever seen that scenario in a movie. Alan Rickman plays a SOB like no one else and he's the total jerk you love anyway (think his Sheriff of Nottingham role) because he's just so good at it and his muttered comments and blatant insults keep you busting out in laughs. I got to the point I was jotting down some of the lines in the show, and thinking I may need to go back to the beginning to write down others, because they're absurd, clever, and all-together brilliant.\n\nIf you need lots of intricate plot twists and details - maybe not for you. If you enjoy understated yet remarkably hilarious verbal humor, witty comeback, diverting insult and repartee, ridiculous colloquialisms and a few side-splitting guffaws, this is the show for you.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24285,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2013-02-13","keywords":"painting,heist,art forgery,cigar smoking,man wears eyeglasses","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1614521369","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzcxODM1MjMwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTEzMzYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzcxODM1MjMwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTEzMzYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An art curator decides to seek revenge on his abusive boss by conning him into buying a fake Monet, but his plan requires the help of an eccentric and unpredictable Texas rodeo queen.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000614/","name":"Alan Rickman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001355/","name":"Michael Hoffman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0326645/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362381/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251858/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0140987/","name":"Sidney Carroll"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The Plot line is predictable, but it is the concepts that the director explores along the way that make it interesting an thought-provoking, assuming you pay attention and didn't just rent it for the bang-bang, or a chance to see Demi in a wet T-shirt. Ridley make some mistakes, but he does some really good things too. Let me comment on what some other people have said, and talk about what I think Ridley does well with this film.\n\nI think Mr. Scott gets a really excellent performance from Demi. I feel this is her best film, but I haven't seen to many, because she usually gets on my nerves. However, she is believable in the role of a woman who just wants to prove to herself that she can do this. I believe her when she says she doesn't want to be a poster child for women's rights... and the Commander is right in telling her that she's gonna have to wear that hat anyway.\n\nViggo is great too. I don't think too many people knew who he was when this movie came out, but he was even billed above Anne Bancroft. Someone said he looks embarrassed in every scene... hogwash. He looks like a very tough character in a very difficult situation. He knows that the issue is not whether a woman can make it, many can. This isn't about women's rights... this is about how men, mainly YOUNG men, relate to women in stressful situations. If all soldiers were in their late thirties, emotionally and psychologically, then the issue would be much smaller. Most of these guys are young, dumb and full of... you know the rhyme. I was there too, once upon a time. Viggo is excellent, he reacts the way many military instructors would... trying to stop the inevitable, fighting against politicians way over his head who have never been in the crap, but think they know better. Pay attention, you can just see that he respects LT O'Neil. But he believes he has to make an example out of her. Ms. Bancroft is excellent as well, some people say over the top, they obviously haven't had to deal with high level politics before. Perhaps she is a bit rough for reality, but remember, it is a movie, making a point, and being entertaining, things have to be gritty... and Senate will always be more vicious than any military training. I find her performance fun and a joy to watch.\n\nI don't know if Mr. Scott has any military training, but he does a better job of conveying the realities of it to the screen than most. Yes, the SERE segment goes farther than real SERE training would go... but not by much. Talk to someone who's been through it. It would not have been the same group of instructors... it's a very specialized field and the instructors have extensive psychological screening and training. However, I'll give that one to Ridley, he's trying not to complicate the plot, and he needs the scene with Master Chief Urgayle. BTW Women do go through SERE sometimes... and the instructors do use them against the men's emotions.\n\nAs for other Militray stuff, much of the language, feelings about chain of command, frustration with training constraints and political a**-covering was /On The Spot/. I speak from 6 years of experience as an Army officer (some of the stuff you see on active duty is amazing, but in the end it all balances out and the US Armed Forces are still the best in the world). Even the way Ridley has to frig with the plot to put the trainees in a an actual firefight was plausible... not possible, but plausible. Remember, it is a movie, he's got to have a real combat situation to entertain the dumber audience who just came to see the boom. But Ridley even goes far enough to give the Master Chief a chance to back out. It is a group of Navy SEAL trainees, deep into their training cycle, with a buttload of prior experience (IF you pay attention you will note that one of the trainees is a US Army Ranger, one a Marine, probably from RECON, these are guys who know the job already, and this is true to reality). You are also talking about a straight forward mission facilitating extraction of US Army Rangers from the deep inland mission. Ridley even has that right, this would be a Ranger mission, and the Spec-ops community may do a joint op where the SEALS secure the sea-side extraction point.\n\nQuite frankly... the movie is better than most people could have done. Matter of fact, I think it was a tough challenge for Mr. Scott and don't think anyone could have done much better. One bad point I agree with is that artistically, the movie is shot entirely too dark.. that's about the worst thing I can say about it though. As for plot predictability... how often do you REALLY see an original plotline?\n\nOne last comment. I was at the Army Officer's Advance Course when this movie came out. There was a group of Officer's that were gong to see this movie, ostensibly to have a good laugh. These were Ranger-qualified Infantry guys, a Marine officer from RECON, a couple guys going to or coming from SF training... all Type A's. The next day they weren't laughing... they just said "you know what, that wasn't half bad." That don't sound like much, but it's high praise from that group.\n\nProbably why this has such a poor rating is because it isn't Hollywood enough for the lowest-common-denominator crowd.\n\nEnjoy the film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":78040,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1997-08-22","keywords":"feminism,military,training,strong female character,soldier","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"G.I.

This one is really great and kinda feel good movie ( at least for me).\n\nWhat I liked about the movie... I liked the landscapes and whole background. Really nice nature of the Corsica ( though I believe it was filmed somewhere in the south of France) and colors of the summer. The soundtrack to the movie was surprisingly new - Lean On, Diamonds by Rihanna and many recent hits. The girls are really believable ( well, I guess all they had to do is to be themselves) and Vincent.

Really nice nature of the Corsica ( though I believe it was filmed somewhere in the south of France) and colors of the summer. The soundtrack to the movie was surprisingly new - Lean On, Diamonds by Rihanna and many recent hits. The girls are really believable ( well, I guess all they had to do is to be themselves) and Vincent.

The Plot line is predictable, but it is the concepts that the director explores along the way that make it interesting an thought-provoking, assuming you pay attention and didn't just rent it for the bang-bang, or a chance to see Demi in a wet T-shirt. Ridley make some mistakes, but he does some really good things too. Let me comment on what some other people have said, and talk about what I think Ridley does well with this film.\n\nI think Mr. Scott gets a really excellent performance from Demi. I feel this is her best film, but I haven't seen to many, because she usually gets on my nerves. However, she is believable in the role of a woman who just wants to prove to herself that she can do this. I believe her when she says she doesn't want to be a poster child for women's rights... and the Commander is right in telling her that she's gonna have to wear that hat anyway.\n\nViggo is great too. I don't think too many people knew who he was when this movie came out, but he was even billed above Anne Bancroft. Someone said he looks embarrassed in every scene... hogwash. He looks like a very tough character in a very difficult situation. He knows that the issue is not whether a woman can make it, many can. This isn't about women's rights... this is about how men, mainly YOUNG men, relate to women in stressful situations. If all soldiers were in their late thirties, emotionally and psychologically, then the issue would be much smaller. Most of these guys are young, dumb and full of... you know the rhyme. I was there too, once upon a time. Viggo is excellent, he reacts the way many military instructors would... trying to stop the inevitable, fighting against politicians way over his head who have never been in the crap, but think they know better. Pay attention, you can just see that he respects LT O'Neil. But he believes he has to make an example out of her. Ms. Bancroft is excellent as well, some people say over the top, they obviously haven't had to deal with high level politics before. Perhaps she is a bit rough for reality, but remember, it is a movie, making a point, and being entertaining, things have to be gritty... and Senate will always be more vicious than any military training. I find her performance fun and a joy to watch.\n\nI don't know if Mr. Scott has any military training, but he does a better job of conveying the realities of it to the screen than most. Yes, the SERE segment goes farther than real SERE training would go... but not by much. Talk to someone who's been through it. It would not have been the same group of instructors... it's a very specialized field and the instructors have extensive psychological screening and training. However, I'll give that one to Ridley, he's trying not to complicate the plot, and he needs the scene with Master Chief Urgayle. BTW Women do go through SERE sometimes... and the instructors do use them against the men's emotions.\n\nAs for other Militray stuff, much of the language, feelings about chain of command, frustration with training constraints and political a**-covering was /On The Spot/. I speak from 6 years of experience as an Army officer (some of the stuff you see on active duty is amazing, but in the end it all balances out and the US Armed Forces are still the best in the world). Even the way Ridley has to frig with the plot to put the trainees in a an actual firefight was plausible... not possible, but plausible. Remember, it is a movie, he's got to have a real combat situation to entertain the dumber audience who just came to see the boom. But Ridley even goes far enough to give the Master Chief a chance to back out. It is a group of Navy SEAL trainees, deep into their training cycle, with a buttload of prior experience (IF you pay attention you will note that one of the trainees is a US Army Ranger, one a Marine, probably from RECON, these are guys who know the job already, and this is true to reality). You are also talking about a straight forward mission facilitating extraction of US Army Rangers from the deep inland mission. Ridley even has that right, this would be a Ranger mission, and the Spec-ops community may do a joint op where the SEALS secure the sea-side extraction point.\n\nQuite frankly... the movie is better than most people could have done. Matter of fact, I think it was a tough challenge for Mr. Scott and don't think anyone could have done much better. One bad point I agree with is that artistically, the movie is shot entirely too dark.. that's about the worst thing I can say about it though. As for plot predictability... how often do you REALLY see an original plotline?\n\nOne last comment. I was at the Army Officer's Advance Course when this movie came out. There was a group of Officer's that were gong to see this movie, ostensibly to have a good laugh. These were Ranger-qualified Infantry guys, a Marine officer from RECON, a couple guys going to or coming from SF training... all Type A's. The next day they weren't laughing... they just said "you know what, that wasn't half bad." That don't sound like much, but it's high praise from that group.\n\nProbably why this has such a poor rating is because it isn't Hollywood enough for the lowest-common-denominator crowd.\n\nEnjoy the film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":78040,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1997-08-22","keywords":"feminism,military,training,strong female character,soldier","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"G.I.

There was a group of Officer's that were gong to see this movie, ostensibly to have a good laugh. These were Ranger-qualified Infantry guys, a Marine officer from RECON, a couple guys going to or coming from SF training... all Type A's. The next day they weren't laughing... they just said "you know what, that wasn't half bad." That don't sound like much, but it's high praise from that group.\n\nProbably why this has such a poor rating is because it isn't Hollywood enough for the lowest-common-denominator crowd.\n\nEnjoy the film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":78040,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1997-08-22","keywords":"feminism,military,training,strong female character,soldier","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"G.I.

A young Algerian man is sent to a French prison." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1235166/","name":"Un prophète","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQ1MTY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY5NjExMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young Algerian man is sent to a French prison.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1235166/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Radu_A"},"dateCreated":"2010-01-12","inLanguage":"English","name":"Watch the Renaissance of French Cinema - a Must-See","reviewBody":"One of the biggest surprises of 2009, Jacques Audiard's 'Un Prophète' is the best French film in a decade, garnering strong critical and word-of-mouth support and winning the Grand Prix in Cannes (which for years now means that it's the actual festival winner). The surprise is that the story is far from being original: a young Arab sentenced to (adult) prison for the first time is forced by a Corsican mafia boss running the strings there to do his bidding. By and by, he manages to use his underling position to his own advantage. So it's a typical hard-boiled underdog story - what makes it so great then? \n\n'Un Prophète' doesn't differ much in style from the French films of late, which were often so hell-bent on displaying life as a gritty and boring affair, and resorted to radical violence to underscore this point, that spectators were almost forced to feel disgusted, which was then claimed to be a denominator of the film's artistic success. This phenomenon has been called 'New French Extremity'. What Jacques Audiard has done is to combine the aesthetics of this trend with the traditions which once made the French film industry the most power- and meaningful in Europe, namely to focus on the relationship of the leading actors. The result is a film that is totally engaging from the first minute, because it entrusts the actors with the task of transforming the script into something of their own making.\n\nAnd boy oh boy, Tahar Rahim does that job. A newcomer with a little bit of TV experience, his performance carries 'Un Prophète' with amazing vigor. It's a big chance, and he takes it.

The surprise is that the story is far from being original: a young Arab sentenced to (adult) prison for the first time is forced by a Corsican mafia boss running the strings there to do his bidding. By and by, he manages to use his underling position to his own advantage. So it's a typical hard-boiled underdog story - what makes it so great then? \n\n'Un Prophète' doesn't differ much in style from the French films of late, which were often so hell-bent on displaying life as a gritty and boring affair, and resorted to radical violence to underscore this point, that spectators were almost forced to feel disgusted, which was then claimed to be a denominator of the film's artistic success. This phenomenon has been called 'New French Extremity'. What Jacques Audiard has done is to combine the aesthetics of this trend with the traditions which once made the French film industry the most power- and meaningful in Europe, namely to focus on the relationship of the leading actors. The result is a film that is totally engaging from the first minute, because it entrusts the actors with the task of transforming the script into something of their own making.\n\nAnd boy oh boy, Tahar Rahim does that job. A newcomer with a little bit of TV experience, his performance carries 'Un Prophète' with amazing vigor. It's a big chance, and he takes it. Would this be an English-language film, he'd be a surefire contender for the awards. His nemesis is portrayed by Niels Arestrup in an equally flawless, yet much more routinized way, which juxtaposes the two characters perfectly. Add to this the sophisticated editing already present in Audiard's last film 'De battre mon coeur s'est arreté' (2005), and you have the best European film of 2009, in spite of a story that you will most likely have seen dozens of times already.\n\nIf you usually don't like European movies, or if you have only time to see one a year, watch this one - you won't regret it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96651,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-08-26","keywords":"strip search,male rear nudity,male frontal nudity,brief male full frontal nudity,shower","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Prophet","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2242839577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MTc0NTA3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM1MjYwMw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MTc0NTA3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM1MjYwMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young Arab man (Rahim) serving time in a French prison transforms into a mafia kingpin.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2588665/","name":"Tahar Rahim","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0034390/","name":"Niels Arestrup","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1513288/","name":"Adel Bencherif"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049689/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086916/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0258767/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0081179/","name":"Thomas Bidegain","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2022382/","name":"Abdel Raouf Dafri"],"duration":"PT2H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie is pretty. That's about it. The story goes nowhere, the plot is unengaging, and I was left underwhelmed. The film tries too hard to be artsy, stylish, and taken serious.

The movie is pretty. That's about it. The story goes nowhere, the plot is unengaging, and I was left underwhelmed. The film tries too hard to be artsy, stylish, and taken serious. Unfortunately, this makes the movie feel slow and pointless. Movies should evoke emotion, making the audience feel something- whether it be sadness, fear, or excitement, etc. This one felt equivalent to sitting in a 3 hour long college lecture on cinematography. I'm not gonna say don't see this movie, but I will say that if you REALLY want to see it, I recommend you wait until you can rent/stream it to save your money and potentially time if you decide to turn it off.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":28415,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Fantasy","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-01-31","keywords":"fairy tale,witch,folk horror,female protagonist,teenage protagonist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1141620505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE0MDBjZTktMzcwNC00ZTE0LWI2YTItZjgyYTkwZmFkZjJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE0MDBjZTktMzcwNC00ZTE0LWI2YTItZjgyYTkwZmFkZjJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"A long time ago in a distant fairytale countryside, a young girl leads her little brother into a dark wood in desperate search of food and work, only to stumble upon a nexus of terrifying evil.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6096118/","name":"Sophia Lillis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10356694/","name":"Samuel Leakey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000481/","name":"Alice Krige"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0674020/","name":"Oz Perkins"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001995/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0309252/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323227/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3304186/","name":"Rob Hayes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342278/","name":"Jacob Grimm","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342303/","name":"Wilhelm Grimm"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

No matter how lofty his vision, his films remain always rooted in the human soul, in the tradition of Heidegger's existential phenomenology, which focuses on the ontology of the earthly Dasein ("being-there") rather than the epistemology of the Lebenswelt ("lifeworld") - even the most overtly metaphysical scenes in Malick remain focused on the physical. And A Hidden Life, which may be his most ostensibly Christian work yet, is quintessentially Malickian, featuring many of his most identifiable stylistic traits (whispered voice-overs, sweeping cameras spinning around non-stationary characters, the beauty of nature contrasted with the ugliness of humanity). Malick's films are about the search for transcendence in a compromised and often evil world, and, telling the true story of the Austrian conscientious objector Franz Jägerstätter, A Hidden Life is no different. And how good is it? Very, very, very good. Not quite The Thin Red Line (1998)/The Tree of Life (2011) good, but certainly Badlands (1973)/Days of Heaven (1978)/The New World (2005) good. This is cinema at its most sublimely pious, a supremely talented master-auteur operating at the height of his not inconsiderable powers. You don't watch A Hidden Life. You let it enter your soul.\n\nAustria, 1938. In the bucolic village of Sankt Radegund, peasant farmer Franz Jägerstätter (August Diehl) lives a simple but blissful life with his wife Fani (Valerie Pachner) and their family. A devout Christian, he's unenthusiastic about the looming war, despite its widespread popularity in the village. Called up to basic training, he's away for several months, but when France surrenders in June 1940, it's thought that the war will soon end, and he's sent home without having been deployed. However, as time goes by, and as the war shows no signs of ending, his opposition grows ever more ingrained, to the point where his family are being harassed. Eventually, he's conscripted, but refuses to swear an oath of allegiance to Hitler, and so is arrested and imprisoned.\n\nNeedless to say, Malick fashions this material into a thematically rich mosaic. To a certain extent, all his films deal, to one degree or another, with the notion of the corruption of Eden, and Hidden Life is as literal as Thin Red Line and New World in this respect. Sankt Radegund is an earthly paradise, hidden in the embrace of the nearby mountains, fed by the River En (the film was originally called simply Radegund, before adopting the George Eliot quote as its title). However, as the war takes hold, the village comes under attack, not by bombs, but by ideological complicity. The harmony and idealism have been corrupted, not by Franz's refusal to comply, by everyone else's insistence on compliance. The village at the end of the film is an infinitely different place from that at the start, a tainted place. Eden has fallen.\n\nFranz doesn't resist the Nazis because he wants to spearhead a movement or because of political high-mindedness. His reasons are simpler - he believes that God teaches us to resist evil, and as a great evil, he must therefore resist Nazism. There's nothing egotistical and precious little that's political in this stance. It's not even a question of personal morality. In an important exchange with Judge Lueben (the late, great Bruno Ganz), Franz is asked, "Do you have a right to do this?", to which he responds, "Do I have a right not to?" His resistance is ingrained in his very soul. Indeed, watching him head willingly toward his tragic fate, turning the other cheek to the prison guards who humiliate and torture him, he becomes something of a Christ figure, with his time in prison not unlike the Passion. An important conversation concerning this is when he is speaking to Ohlendorf (Johan Leysen), a cynical artisan who is restoring the local church's artwork. Ohlendorf laments that he must work not on images of Christ's suffering as it was, but on the sanitised version desired by the clergy, and he lacks the courage to do otherwise; "I paint their comfortable Christ, with a halo over his head. Some day I might have the courage to venture. Not yet. Some day. I'll paint the true Christ." It's a subtle summation of Franz's situation, of course, but so too of the film, which shows Franz's suffering as it was even as it celebrates the power of faith to transcend such suffering.\n\nIn this sense, much like Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) in Thin Red Line, Franz is a Heideggerian sein-zum-tode ("being-towards-death"). This describes not the hastening towards the end of Dasein in a biological sense but is rather about the process of growing in the Lebenswelt to a point where one gains an authentic perspective, as one comes to completely accept the temporality of this existence, and hence no longer fear death. The application to both Witt and Franz is obvious - both men accept that this world is transitory and that life is simply part of the soul's eternal journey, so neither man fears death, and by not fearing it, they triumph over it.\n\nAesthetically, as one expects from Malick, A Hidden Life is almost overwhelmingly beautiful, particularly in its depiction of nature. Shooting digitally, Malick and his first-time cinematographer Jörg Widmer shot most of the exteriors (and some of the interiors) in a wide-lens anamorphic format that distorts everything outside the dead-centre of the frame. The effect is subtle (we're not talking fisheye lens distortion), but important - pushing the mountains further around the village, bringing the sky closer, elongating the already vast fields. This is a land beyond time, a modern Utopia that kisses the very sky.\n\nThe film opens with the sounds of birds chirping and a river flowing, followed by a voice-over in which Fani invokes the natural grandeur of Sankt Radegund ("I thought that we could build our nest high-up. In the trees. Fly away like birds to the mountains"). All of this before we see a single image. The film then begins (and closes) on breath-taking shots of the mountains around the village. However, a lot of the VO is epistolary, with large portions taken from the letters Franz and Fani write to one another when he was in prison. For Malick, this is a very conventional style to employ, especially insofar as his VOs have been getting more and more abstract as his films have gone on.\n\nAs for problems, as a Malick fanatic, I found very few. You know what you're getting with a Malick film, so complaining about the length (it's just shy of three hours) or the pace is kind of pointless. You know if you like how Malick paces his films, and if you found, for example, New World boring beyond belief, so too will you find Hidden Life. One thing I will say, though, there are a few scenes in the last act that are a little repetitive, giving us information we already have or hitting emotional beats we've already hit. It could also be argued that the film abstracts or flat-out ignores the real horrors of World War II, but that's by design. It isn't about those horrors, and Thin Red Line proves Malick has no problem showing man's inhumanity to man. The same is true for politics; much like 1917 (2019), Hidden Life is not about politics, so to accuse it of failing to address politics is to imply it's obliged to address politics. Which it most certainly is not.\n\nIn the end, A Hidden Life left me profoundly moved, on a level that very, very few films have (Thin Red Line and Tree of Life amongst them). Less a film than a spiritual odyssey, if you're a Malick fan, you should be enraptured. I don't know if I'd necessarily call it a masterpiece, but it's certainly close and is easily the best film of 2019 that I've seen thus far (the fact that it missed out on a single Academy Award nomination is a commentary unto itself).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21950,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-01-17","keywords":"world war two,nazi,anti nazism,death penalty,third reich","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Select Theaters Now","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4230135577","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA4OWE4MTctNWUxZi00NDU2LWI0MmQtMjdjZDcwOTliM2E0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA4OWE4MTctNWUxZi00NDU2LWI0MmQtMjdjZDcwOTliM2E0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0225944/","name":"August Diehl"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5638960/","name":"Valerie Pachner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800314/","name":"Maria Simon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0630986/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"duration":"PT2H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

No matter how lofty his vision, his films remain always rooted in the human soul, in the tradition of Heidegger's existential phenomenology, which focuses on the ontology of the earthly Dasein ("being-there") rather than the epistemology of the Lebenswelt ("lifeworld") - even the most overtly metaphysical scenes in Malick remain focused on the physical. And A Hidden Life, which may be his most ostensibly Christian work yet, is quintessentially Malickian, featuring many of his most identifiable stylistic traits (whispered voice-overs, sweeping cameras spinning around non-stationary characters, the beauty of nature contrasted with the ugliness of humanity). Malick's films are about the search for transcendence in a compromised and often evil world, and, telling the true story of the Austrian conscientious objector Franz Jägerstätter, A Hidden Life is no different. And how good is it? Very, very, very good. Not quite The Thin Red Line (1998)/The Tree of Life (2011) good, but certainly Badlands (1973)/Days of Heaven (1978)/The New World (2005) good. This is cinema at its most sublimely pious, a supremely talented master-auteur operating at the height of his not inconsiderable powers. You don't watch A Hidden Life. You let it enter your soul.\n\nAustria, 1938. In the bucolic village of Sankt Radegund, peasant farmer Franz Jägerstätter (August Diehl) lives a simple but blissful life with his wife Fani (Valerie Pachner) and their family. A devout Christian, he's unenthusiastic about the looming war, despite its widespread popularity in the village. Called up to basic training, he's away for several months, but when France surrenders in June 1940, it's thought that the war will soon end, and he's sent home without having been deployed. However, as time goes by, and as the war shows no signs of ending, his opposition grows ever more ingrained, to the point where his family are being harassed. Eventually, he's conscripted, but refuses to swear an oath of allegiance to Hitler, and so is arrested and imprisoned.\n\nNeedless to say, Malick fashions this material into a thematically rich mosaic. To a certain extent, all his films deal, to one degree or another, with the notion of the corruption of Eden, and Hidden Life is as literal as Thin Red Line and New World in this respect. Sankt Radegund is an earthly paradise, hidden in the embrace of the nearby mountains, fed by the River En (the film was originally called simply Radegund, before adopting the George Eliot quote as its title). However, as the war takes hold, the village comes under attack, not by bombs, but by ideological complicity. The harmony and idealism have been corrupted, not by Franz's refusal to comply, by everyone else's insistence on compliance. The village at the end of the film is an infinitely different place from that at the start, a tainted place. Eden has fallen.\n\nFranz doesn't resist the Nazis because he wants to spearhead a movement or because of political high-mindedness. His reasons are simpler - he believes that God teaches us to resist evil, and as a great evil, he must therefore resist Nazism. There's nothing egotistical and precious little that's political in this stance. It's not even a question of personal morality. In an important exchange with Judge Lueben (the late, great Bruno Ganz), Franz is asked, "Do you have a right to do this?", to which he responds, "Do I have a right not to?" His resistance is ingrained in his very soul. Indeed, watching him head willingly toward his tragic fate, turning the other cheek to the prison guards who humiliate and torture him, he becomes something of a Christ figure, with his time in prison not unlike the Passion. An important conversation concerning this is when he is speaking to Ohlendorf (Johan Leysen), a cynical artisan who is restoring the local church's artwork. Ohlendorf laments that he must work not on images of Christ's suffering as it was, but on the sanitised version desired by the clergy, and he lacks the courage to do otherwise; "I paint their comfortable Christ, with a halo over his head. Some day I might have the courage to venture. Not yet. Some day. I'll paint the true Christ." It's a subtle summation of Franz's situation, of course, but so too of the film, which shows Franz's suffering as it was even as it celebrates the power of faith to transcend such suffering.\n\nIn this sense, much like Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) in Thin Red Line, Franz is a Heideggerian sein-zum-tode ("being-towards-death"). This describes not the hastening towards the end of Dasein in a biological sense but is rather about the process of growing in the Lebenswelt to a point where one gains an authentic perspective, as one comes to completely accept the temporality of this existence, and hence no longer fear death. The application to both Witt and Franz is obvious - both men accept that this world is transitory and that life is simply part of the soul's eternal journey, so neither man fears death, and by not fearing it, they triumph over it.\n\nAesthetically, as one expects from Malick, A Hidden Life is almost overwhelmingly beautiful, particularly in its depiction of nature. Shooting digitally, Malick and his first-time cinematographer Jörg Widmer shot most of the exteriors (and some of the interiors) in a wide-lens anamorphic format that distorts everything outside the dead-centre of the frame. The effect is subtle (we're not talking fisheye lens distortion), but important - pushing the mountains further around the village, bringing the sky closer, elongating the already vast fields. This is a land beyond time, a modern Utopia that kisses the very sky.\n\nThe film opens with the sounds of birds chirping and a river flowing, followed by a voice-over in which Fani invokes the natural grandeur of Sankt Radegund ("I thought that we could build our nest high-up. In the trees. Fly away like birds to the mountains"). All of this before we see a single image. The film then begins (and closes) on breath-taking shots of the mountains around the village. However, a lot of the VO is epistolary, with large portions taken from the letters Franz and Fani write to one another when he was in prison. For Malick, this is a very conventional style to employ, especially insofar as his VOs have been getting more and more abstract as his films have gone on.\n\nAs for problems, as a Malick fanatic, I found very few. You know what you're getting with a Malick film, so complaining about the length (it's just shy of three hours) or the pace is kind of pointless. You know if you like how Malick paces his films, and if you found, for example, New World boring beyond belief, so too will you find Hidden Life. One thing I will say, though, there are a few scenes in the last act that are a little repetitive, giving us information we already have or hitting emotional beats we've already hit. It could also be argued that the film abstracts or flat-out ignores the real horrors of World War II, but that's by design. It isn't about those horrors, and Thin Red Line proves Malick has no problem showing man's inhumanity to man. The same is true for politics; much like 1917 (2019), Hidden Life is not about politics, so to accuse it of failing to address politics is to imply it's obliged to address politics. Which it most certainly is not.\n\nIn the end, A Hidden Life left me profoundly moved, on a level that very, very few films have (Thin Red Line and Tree of Life amongst them). Less a film than a spiritual odyssey, if you're a Malick fan, you should be enraptured. I don't know if I'd necessarily call it a masterpiece, but it's certainly close and is easily the best film of 2019 that I've seen thus far (the fact that it missed out on a single Academy Award nomination is a commentary unto itself).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21950,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-01-17","keywords":"world war two,nazi,anti nazism,death penalty,third reich","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Select Theaters Now","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4230135577","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA4OWE4MTctNWUxZi00NDU2LWI0MmQtMjdjZDcwOTliM2E0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA4OWE4MTctNWUxZi00NDU2LWI0MmQtMjdjZDcwOTliM2E0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0225944/","name":"August Diehl"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5638960/","name":"Valerie Pachner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800314/","name":"Maria Simon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0630986/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"duration":"PT2H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For Malick, this is a very conventional style to employ, especially insofar as his VOs have been getting more and more abstract as his films have gone on.\n\nAs for problems, as a Malick fanatic, I found very few. You know what you're getting with a Malick film, so complaining about the length (it's just shy of three hours) or the pace is kind of pointless. You know if you like how Malick paces his films, and if you found, for example, New World boring beyond belief, so too will you find Hidden Life. One thing I will say, though, there are a few scenes in the last act that are a little repetitive, giving us information we already have or hitting emotional beats we've already hit. It could also be argued that the film abstracts or flat-out ignores the real horrors of World War II, but that's by design. It isn't about those horrors, and Thin Red Line proves Malick has no problem showing man's inhumanity to man. The same is true for politics; much like 1917 (2019), Hidden Life is not about politics, so to accuse it of failing to address politics is to imply it's obliged to address politics. Which it most certainly is not.\n\nIn the end, A Hidden Life left me profoundly moved, on a level that very, very few films have (Thin Red Line and Tree of Life amongst them). Less a film than a spiritual odyssey, if you're a Malick fan, you should be enraptured. I don't know if I'd necessarily call it a masterpiece, but it's certainly close and is easily the best film of 2019 that I've seen thus far (the fact that it missed out on a single Academy Award nomination is a commentary unto itself).","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21950,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-01-17","keywords":"world war two,nazi,anti nazism,death penalty,third reich","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Select Theaters Now","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4230135577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA4OWE4MTctNWUxZi00NDU2LWI0MmQtMjdjZDcwOTliM2E0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA4OWE4MTctNWUxZi00NDU2LWI0MmQtMjdjZDcwOTliM2E0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0225944/","name":"August Diehl","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5638960/","name":"Valerie Pachner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800314/","name":"Maria Simon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0630986/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"],"duration":"PT2H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Emma returning to him is also incredible for an intelligent woman that was used. But forgetting these ridiculous situations, the viewer can enjoy the beauty of Amber Heard; the always great Gary Oldman and Richard Dreyfuss; see Josh "Sawyer" Holloway once again; and a good cast with Harrison Ford, Embeth Davidtz, Julian McMahon and Liam Hemsworth. Shutdown your brain and you may have a good time. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Conexão Perigosa" ("Dangerous Connection")","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36279,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-08-16","keywords":"spying,thumbprint,traffic,man wears a swimsuit,man wrapped in a towel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3075778073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyODQ4NTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyODQ4NTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The two most powerful tech billionaires in the world are bitter rivals with a complicated past.

New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film. Critics bashed it for being insulting, unoriginal, and unmoving. Let me make some corrections for them so that they can save a little face.\n\nI'm no Tom Cruise fan. A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in. Mostly this has to do with Cruise's personal life and beliefs (just watch an episode of South Park to see how some people view him and you'll see what I mean). People have similar feelings toward Mel Gibson ...but I digress.\n\nVALKYRIE, as most of you probably now know, is the final of 15 attempts on Hitler's life. Shortly after this (about nine months) he committed suicide in his bunker. But this is about the one time where it almost succeeded. I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).\n\nTom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...\n\nWhat makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.\n\nIt is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.\n\nIf the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect.

New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film. Critics bashed it for being insulting, unoriginal, and unmoving. Let me make some corrections for them so that they can save a little face.\n\nI'm no Tom Cruise fan. A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in. Mostly this has to do with Cruise's personal life and beliefs (just watch an episode of South Park to see how some people view him and you'll see what I mean). People have similar feelings toward Mel Gibson ...but I digress.\n\nVALKYRIE, as most of you probably now know, is the final of 15 attempts on Hitler's life. Shortly after this (about nine months) he committed suicide in his bunker. But this is about the one time where it almost succeeded. I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).\n\nTom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...\n\nWhat makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.\n\nIt is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.\n\nIf the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that "I was on the edge of my seat" throughout the second half of the film.\n\nSo if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":235855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-01-21","keywords":"national socialism,near miss,dilettantism,incompetence,20 july plot","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Valkyrie: Featurette -- "Through Bryan Singer's Eyes"","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3544383513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODczMTg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODczMTg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Valkyrie: Featurette -- "Through Bryan Singer's Eyes"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0631490/","name":"Bill Nighy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0396924/","name":"Carice van Houten"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001741/","name":"Bryan Singer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057712/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1267492/","name":"Nathan Alexander"],"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is an almost forgotten film about a time and a youth nearly forgotten, as well. And I will say, as a writer, the novella that this film was based upon, "The Body" has and always will be the inspiration for my style of writing.\n\nFirst of all, I enjoy the title that was chosen for the film. "Stand By Me" fits what the characters in the story are facing.  I think that all who have seen this film will agree that the problems are all things that we can relate to.  All of us know someone like these characters. Most of us have met the boy down the road who had a brother with a bad name and a father with an alcohol problem, automatically being labeled as a "bad kid." And the boy with the military father, abusive and a little whacko. The fat kid, picked on and ridiculed for his weight.\n\nTo me, Gordy represents all of us. I found myself seeing a little of me in Gordy as I watched the film. I don't know if any one else shares this, but it was true. Gordy was not very strong, at first, and was not sure what he wanted, except to be with his friends. Still coping with the loss of his brother and the fact that his father was disrespectful to him, Gordy still stood up for what he believed in. And, in the end he surprised the characters and the viewers by standing up to the bullies that had plagued them all.\n\nThis film is certainly one of my top favorites. In fact, it lies in my top three, probably at #2 or #3. I feel that it is a film that everyone should see at some point in their life due to the fact it changes your look at youth and their trials. Few films are able to do that and I think that this one was an inspiration for others that will do the same in the future.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":382388,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1986-08-22","keywords":"friendship,childhood,coming of age film,walking on train tracks,summertime","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stand By Me","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2284829721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1NmQ5YWUtMmU2OC00MzQ0LWE4YmYtYTFmNWM2ZmUxYWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1NmQ5YWUtMmU2OC00MzQ0LWE4YmYtYTFmNWM2ZmUxYWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000696/","name":"Wil Wheaton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000203/","name":"River Phoenix"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000397/","name":"Corey Feldman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001661/","name":"Rob Reiner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015549/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043140/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000175/","name":"Stephen King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0317279/","name":"Raynold Gideon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0262595/","name":"Bruce A.

This film is so beautifully made and is very touching and moving. The story follows the young Syrian Omar (Amir El-Masry) who ends up in a remote Scottish island until he finds out if he's granted asylum. He lives with three other immigrants from other nationalities and they live in a small house in the middle of nowhere, while they attend cultural awareness sessions to develop their social skills. Omar doesn't say much, but his eyes says it all. He feels alone and out of place, while he's an aspiring musician who plays the oud, he never played since he left Syria, and due to a hand injury he remains unable to play. He calls his parents over the phone, where they tell him about their struggle as well, as they live in Turkey, while his brother Nabil remains in Syria to fight for his country. Omar feels that he's not good enough as his brave brother who wasn't afraid to stay in his war-torn country, while he's haunted by his father's words who keeps reminding him " a musician who doesn't play, is a dead man". Omar struggles with his memories of his life with his family back home, where they used to grow apricots and sing old songs, and he used to play oud in front of audience. But now he just wanders the open roads and fields, and he just talks with his roommate Farhad, who's been waiting for more than two years for his asylum claim. Omar walks everywhere with his oud case which was given to him by his grandfather, maybe because he doesn't want to lose it, as it's the only thing he has left that reminds him of his old life. The film has a lot of other moving stories related to the other immigrants and Omar's relationship with his brother, as all of them highlight how cruel it is for any refugee who's forced to leave his country and venture into the unknown, while leaving his loved ones behind and facing a world he doesn't recognize or belong to. The writer and director Ben Sharrock was able to capture the inner feelings of an Arab in a foreign country, and the Cinematography of the vast landscape with very beautiful. Also the depiction of Arab songs was lovely especially the song in the end titles by Magda El Romi. This is one of those rare films that is so human and it's brilliance lies in its simplicity yet it has such great emotional depth. Finally Amir El-Masry is such a talented actor, who could be the next Rami Malek, who knows.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2119,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-07-30","keywords":"one word title,musician as protagonist,separation from family,musician,scottish island","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2474754073","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q2ODMxMDYtODMzYi00MzIzLWJiMjYtZDVmMTlhZjlhZjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q2ODMxMDYtODMzYi00MzIzLWJiMjYtZDVmMTlhZjlhZjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Omar is a promising young musician.

Writer/director/actor Edward Norton paid homage to the classics in this movie. Featuring an All-Star cast, there was no way he could lose with the characters' performances. I think that is the one drawback of the film, with such a stellar cast he had to give everyone time and the movie boasts a runtime of 2:24 minutes. A bit lengthy for a crime drama/who done it because there will be slower portions of the film. However, it was never boring and the dialogue is spot-on with the snappiness of Sin City but it doesn't come across as a caricature. A very entertaining film and please don't be emo like me and cry after the opening scene.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51730,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-11-01","keywords":"neo noir,1950s,jazz music,based on novel,detective","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi800112409","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ2YjJlYWItNjQxMi00ZWNjLTgxNjAtMzc4NTRmZjI3NTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ2YjJlYWItNjQxMi00ZWNjLTgxNjAtMzc4NTRmZjI3NTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set against the backdrop of 1950s New York, 'Motherless Brooklyn' follows Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton), a private detective living with Tourette Syndrome, as he ventures to solve the murder of his mentor and only friend, Frank Minna (Bruce Willis).

In a mystery that carries him from gin-soaked jazz clubs in Harlem to the hard-edged slums of Brooklyn and, finally, into the gilded halls of New York's power brokers, Lionel contends with thugs, corruption and the most dangerous man in the city to honor his friend and save the woman who might be his own salvation."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1813221/","name":"Gugu Mbatha-Raw"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113781/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113140/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504672/","name":"Jonathan Lethem"}],"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Writer/director/actor Edward Norton paid homage to the classics in this movie. Featuring an All-Star cast, there was no way he could lose with the characters' performances. I think that is the one drawback of the film, with such a stellar cast he had to give everyone time and the movie boasts a runtime of 2:24 minutes. A bit lengthy for a crime drama/who done it because there will be slower portions of the film. However, it was never boring and the dialogue is spot-on with the snappiness of Sin City but it doesn't come across as a caricature. A very entertaining film and please don't be emo like me and cry after the opening scene.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51730,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-11-01","keywords":"neo noir,1950s,jazz music,based on novel,detective","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi800112409","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ2YjJlYWItNjQxMi00ZWNjLTgxNjAtMzc4NTRmZjI3NTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ2YjJlYWItNjQxMi00ZWNjLTgxNjAtMzc4NTRmZjI3NTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set against the backdrop of 1950s New York, 'Motherless Brooklyn' follows Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton), a private detective living with Tourette Syndrome, as he ventures to solve the murder of his mentor and only friend, Frank Minna (Bruce Willis).

Klaus Maria Brandauer gave a convincing villain in Maximilian Largo - slimy and sly, making you want to punch him in the face.\n\nThe film its adventurous moments, but, it's not one of the best Bond movies out there - it's more like a stand alone action flick.\n\nGrade C+","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65450,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1983-10-07","keywords":"unofficial sequel,james bond character,tough girl,gun violence,spy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Never Say Never Again","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1906574617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYyYzlhNDktYTM1OS00YzI3LWIxZDUtYTA2MTA1NzI5NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYyYzlhNDktYTM1OS00YzI3LWIxZDUtYTA2MTA1NzI5NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from MGM/UA","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000107/","name":"Kim Basinger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001970/","name":"Klaus Maria Brandauer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0449984/","name":"Irvin Kershner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078552/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035468/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565886/","name":"Kevin McClory","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926525/","name":"Jack Whittingham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT2H14M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But what I want to say after seeing it was 1/see the first film 2/read the book. One of the most essential points to film was left out altogether in that when Bathsheba sent her 'joke' valentine to Boldwood she wrote the words 'Marry Me' on it. It wasn't the roses-are-red etc that got Boldwood in a twist it was the two words she wrote on the card. We get no sense of the quandary and deliberating over this that went on within Boldwood for some time before he made his move (and his ultimate obsession) in this film as we do in the first.\n\nI think the scene when Fanny got the wrong church was disappointing as well.

But what I want to say after seeing it was 1/see the first film 2/read the book. One of the most essential points to film was left out altogether in that when Bathsheba sent her 'joke' valentine to Boldwood she wrote the words 'Marry Me' on it. It wasn't the roses-are-red etc that got Boldwood in a twist it was the two words she wrote on the card. We get no sense of the quandary and deliberating over this that went on within Boldwood for some time before he made his move (and his ultimate obsession) in this film as we do in the first.\n\nI think the scene when Fanny got the wrong church was disappointing as well. There was no sense of the mad dash she had across town to find the right church and only to find Frank striding out full of indignation at being stood up and telling her "It's too late!" The beautiful words of Gabriel to Bathsheba "when I look up there ye will be and when you look up there I will be" just don't feature at all.\n\nThe "shooting at the end was tame to say the least &amp; Martin Sheen was much less forceful in his insistence of marrying Bathsheba But I did like Carey Mulligan as Bathdheba.

Murchoch Mysteries is one of 4 particular shows that I watch regularly - and tape so that I do not miss them.\n\nThere are three main reasons that I like MM.\n\nFirst, it is such a pleasure to watch something that does not have swearing, sex scenes, and gratuitous violence. Even though there are the odd (bordering on) romantic interludes the story line remains true to the theme of the title and they do not over-shadow the stories.\n\nSecond, I quite like viewing shows that depict times gone by and it is interesting to see how detectives'/police duties were (supposedly) undertaken in that time.\n\nThird, the acting and story telling - as noted in a previous post - equals that of Midsummer Murders, Poirot (another favourite of mine), Judge John Deed (again, another favourite).\n\nI like each character who has a distinct role and adds to the show as well as the enjoyment of watching the show. I do hope that there are quite a few new series planned.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12369,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The fact that it comes from WGN creates a stigma towards that many viewers are unable to surpass. But trust me once you dwell into the first couple of episodes, you will not regret it. \n\nThe writers on this show have done an incredible job in incorporating historical events into a show that is mostly based around fictional characters (although Oppenheimer makes several appearances, and Neils Bohr and Einstein also make brief appearances) and events. This creates a encapsulating drama that accompanies the main storyline about the creation of the atomic bomb. If you are looking for a historically accurate show more about the physics and mathematics behind the atomic bomb this is definitely not the show for you. At its heart it is a fully fledged drama. In particular I would like to commend the writers on drawing out the psychological trauma and difficulties placed on the scientists and individuals responsible for creating the bomb. This creates a more emotional connection to the characters and thus creates a synthetic sympathetic connection to these fictitious characters. Although generic at some stages the story lines are generally full of surprises which you would not expect and forces you to view the next episode, as any good televisions show should. Manhattan is one of those shows that are better watched several episodes in a row as the episodes tend to jump between the main character in focus.\n\nOverall this is a criminally underrated show by the television community and should be given more credit for what has become a gripping show.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8259,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2014-07-27","keywords":"1940s,year 1944,year 1943,manhattan project,los alamos new mexico","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3014031/","name":"Rachel Brosnahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985974/","name":"Michael Chernus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706832/","name":"Christopher Denham"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126698/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0562101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2212280/","name":"Sam Shaw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1935127321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Murchoch Mysteries is one of 4 particular shows that I watch regularly - and tape so that I do not miss them.\n\nThere are three main reasons that I like MM.\n\nFirst, it is such a pleasure to watch something that does not have swearing, sex scenes, and gratuitous violence. Even though there are the odd (bordering on) romantic interludes the story line remains true to the theme of the title and they do not over-shadow the stories.\n\nSecond, I quite like viewing shows that depict times gone by and it is interesting to see how detectives'/police duties were (supposedly) undertaken in that time.\n\nThird, the acting and story telling - as noted in a previous post - equals that of Midsummer Murders, Poirot (another favourite of mine), Judge John Deed (again, another favourite).\n\nI like each character who has a distinct role and adds to the show as well as the enjoyment of watching the show. I do hope that there are quite a few new series planned.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12369,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Massive liberties taken with history, but we should all know by now that any show "based on historical events" is just that - most of the people existed, some of the things happened, but most of it is pure fiction. Still, I often find these kinds of shows interesting because they lure me into checking the historical facts, which is educational.

The fact that it comes from WGN creates a stigma towards that many viewers are unable to surpass. But trust me once you dwell into the first couple of episodes, you will not regret it. \n\nThe writers on this show have done an incredible job in incorporating historical events into a show that is mostly based around fictional characters (although Oppenheimer makes several appearances, and Neils Bohr and Einstein also make brief appearances) and events. This creates a encapsulating drama that accompanies the main storyline about the creation of the atomic bomb. If you are looking for a historically accurate show more about the physics and mathematics behind the atomic bomb this is definitely not the show for you. At its heart it is a fully fledged drama. In particular I would like to commend the writers on drawing out the psychological trauma and difficulties placed on the scientists and individuals responsible for creating the bomb. This creates a more emotional connection to the characters and thus creates a synthetic sympathetic connection to these fictitious characters. Although generic at some stages the story lines are generally full of surprises which you would not expect and forces you to view the next episode, as any good televisions show should. Manhattan is one of those shows that are better watched several episodes in a row as the episodes tend to jump between the main character in focus.\n\nOverall this is a criminally underrated show by the television community and should be given more credit for what has become a gripping show.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8259,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2014-07-27","keywords":"1940s,year 1944,year 1943,manhattan project,los alamos new mexico","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3014031/","name":"Rachel Brosnahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985974/","name":"Michael Chernus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706832/","name":"Christopher Denham"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126698/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0562101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2212280/","name":"Sam Shaw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1935127321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Brenda Lee Johnson is an outstanding interrogator with a background of being difficult to work with but achieving great results. However, her personal life is a mess. She is hired from Atlanta to head LAPD's Priority Crimes Unit for those high profile crimes that need a resolution and need it quickly. Tensions arise immediately. Her brusque style makes her own people want to transfer away, her boss is a former lover who dumped her and she manages to make many more enemies than friends. The crimes are formula enough that you can probably figure out whodunit before you get to the climax but it's the characters and relationships that sell the show and make it worth watching. Not only is Kyra Sedgwick giving the performance of her life in this series but she has a terrific supporting cast that gives the series heart. The ability of the writers to also give us some great comic lines keeps the show teetering at times from comedy to drama. The first season is already out on DVD. Watch it from the first episode to the last, in order, and you can see why this show has become the most watched show in basic cable history.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24474,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

Brenda Lee Johnson is an outstanding interrogator with a background of being difficult to work with but achieving great results. However, her personal life is a mess. She is hired from Atlanta to head LAPD's Priority Crimes Unit for those high profile crimes that need a resolution and need it quickly. Tensions arise immediately. Her brusque style makes her own people want to transfer away, her boss is a former lover who dumped her and she manages to make many more enemies than friends. The crimes are formula enough that you can probably figure out whodunit before you get to the climax but it's the characters and relationships that sell the show and make it worth watching. Not only is Kyra Sedgwick giving the performance of her life in this series but she has a terrific supporting cast that gives the series heart. The ability of the writers to also give us some great comic lines keeps the show teetering at times from comedy to drama. The first season is already out on DVD. Watch it from the first episode to the last, in order, and you can see why this show has become the most watched show in basic cable history.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24474,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

Some of the people in the story are very exaggerated and cliché like but in some strange way it is part of the charm. \n\nI did not find the main character Zoe Hart very believable as a doctor but that really did not bother me as I found that the personal development of all the characters was more important and relevant to the story and that is part of the charm.\n\nIn the first 2-3 episodes, two characters (Wade and Lemon) stood out to me as very irritating until the story develops. Along the way the story starts to unwrap their past, the life they have been colored by and shows what character they really hold but also allows one to understand their behavior.

Some of the people in the story are very exaggerated and cliché like but in some strange way it is part of the charm. \n\nI did not find the main character Zoe Hart very believable as a doctor but that really did not bother me as I found that the personal development of all the characters was more important and relevant to the story and that is part of the charm.\n\nIn the first 2-3 episodes, two characters (Wade and Lemon) stood out to me as very irritating until the story develops. Along the way the story starts to unwrap their past, the life they have been colored by and shows what character they really hold but also allows one to understand their behavior. As the story continues those two have slowly become my favorite and I just want to give them a hug, they deserve something good to find it's way to them.\n\nThis way of telling the story is central and easy as it grabs hold of once affection for those characters that live in this town and they grow on you.

I was bored and a friend recommended me this series. I'm not a big fan of scary drama, but I was addicted from episode one.\n\nThe characters are unbelievably interesting, and every little detail makes sense. It's the kind of show that keeps you wishing you had more and more episodes available to watch. It's really thought-provoking-- meaning, a lot of theories and ideas are going to start popping up in your head and you'll find yourself addicted to this show soon enough. \n\nIf you haven't watched it yet, do yourself a favor and do it.

It is one of the best movies I've seen last year, and more than that it is even more special due to the brilliant and amazing performance of its cast.\n\nThe return of Mickey Rourke was overdue, a gifted and talented actor, who in my opinion was wrongly shunned and marginalized because of his past attitude and behaviour which marked him as a "bad boy". Hollywood surely likes to sometimes punish its own, especially those individuals who don't repent and crawl on their knees asking for "cinematic forgiveness" from their peers. What happened to Mickey Rourke was pure hypocrisy on the part of an industry that has no problem tolerating much, much worse behaviour on the part of less talented individuals; an industry that from time to time seeks to attain some kind of superficial saving grace marked by a phony mea culpa and a symbolic sacrificial lamb, in this case Mickey Rourke. I ask, how is what he did any different than the behaviour of let's say Lindsay Lohan, whom many critics where at one point anointing her as the next Jody Foster or Merryl Streep?!?!? Talk about self-imposed blindness! When I last saw Rourke in "Sin City", I was, albeit briefly but forcefully reminded, of how good of an actor he really is. So imagine my pleasure and anticipation when "The Wrestler" came out! At heart this is a story of redemption, but here comes the kick, it is actually an attempt and ultimate failure at redemption, at least in the sense that redemption is understood in today's society. This is a profoundly sad movie, but that fact does not take away one bit from the movie, rather it makes it more believable and even more powerful.\n\nAs Bruce Springsteen's song by the same title points out, there are some wrongs that can't be righted and some wounds that can't be mended, and that is the situation Mikey Rourke's character finds himself in. I don't want to discuss the movie in detail, nor give anything away from the plot or storyline, suffice to say that this is one viewing that is more than worth sitting through from beginning to end.\n\nRourke, Marisa Tomei (another grossly underrated actress) and Evan Rachel Wood are phenomenal and really hold their own and make the most of their on-screen time. Whatever award nominations and wins these actors are likely to get are more than deserved. Darren Aronofsky has really grown by leaps and bounds in his solid and varied career as director. I am personally glad that he decided to helm this project, the end result speaks for itself.\n\nUltimately there is redemption to be found in this movie, but it comes at a heavy price, to me that redemption takes the form of the triumph of the human spirit against insurmountable odds and seemingly impossible choices. These days that is a bold statement to make!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":297947,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2009-01-30","keywords":"stripper,professional wrestler,new jersey,father daughter relationship,tragic ending","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Wrestler","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1387528985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTAxNjY4NzUyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc5MTUwMg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTAxNjY4NzUyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc5MTUwMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A drama centered on retired professional wrestler Randy "The Ram" Robinson as he makes his way through the independent circuit, trying to get back in the game for one final showdown with his former rival."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000620/","name":"Mickey Rourke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000673/","name":"Marisa Tomei"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939697/","name":"Evan Rachel Wood"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024845/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062935/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010750/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1557909/","name":"Robert Siegel"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A Vegas entertainer once, he got to know the local mob and was taken by the lifestyle to the point that he began his own crew. Unfortunately for him and everyone he knows, it has caught up with him and he now finds himself targeted by all sides and in the hands of the FBI, desperately trying to make a deal with them from the security of the penthouse floor of a luxury hotel. However the FBI pick up wind of a hit called in by Sparazza with a strict time limit, a $1,000,000 bounty and cut out Buddy's heart. It is not long before a handful of bounty hunters are heading towards the hotel with one aim  to be the first.\n\nOn a transatlantic flight during the day I had time for one more film before landing. As I was just trying to relax I was looking for undemanding stuff just to distract and entertain me. The film I watched first was Shooter and I mention this deliberately. Shooter was only an OK film but what it did was lay out its stall and make it very clear what it was going to do and how it was going to do it  not necessarily in terms of plotting but more in terms of style and approach. It wasn't great but it worked. I assumed that Smokin' Aces would do the same as the trailer made it look like a comic hit-man film  with hyper filming, lots of stars and lots of action.\n\nNow, if you're thinking that I shouldn't assume then you're right, but this is how the film starts and it is how it is at various stages across the film. However it goes from being a bit like Guy Richie (freeze frames, names on screen etc) to being an all out action fest, with guns everywhere and people surviving the way that they only do in action films. The suddenly in the final third it decides that it not going to be superficially comic or superficially action-packed and suddenly seemed to have an emotional side and expected me to care about the characters and their plights  like it had been a serious drama all along (although I'm not sure how I'm supposed to take the ADD kid with the erection in that context).\n\nIn doing this it does still do just about enough to keep a story going but to be honest I started to get bored as it changed tone based on whatever it want to do. Another problem I had with it was the violence  it was very brutal throughout, which I don't have a problem with but the mixed tone meant it was confused. With the comic feel the violent death of characters is really jarring, likewise with the action section  it just seemed too much and made it hard to enjoy. The final turn of tone actually makes the violence work because the extent of it works when you actually are expected to feel it  however by then it was too little too late.\n\nKeeping this in mind it is no surprise that nobody is really that good. Piven goes from ham to tragic figure; it is a nice try but the film doesn't go with him and he is left exposed. Reynolds is reasonably good on the level he works on, a good presence  I've never seen him in anything that good but I generally like him when I see him. Affleck, Berg, Garcia, Liotta and a few others are solid enough but not anything special. Keys is good-looking but she is helped by Henson who is sassy and cute at the same time. The real stand out for me was Common. He dropped out of a big tour to make this and I felt bad that he seemed to be going down the "rapper goes to Hollywood to be in action movie" path. However he is actually one of the few who impressed me; not throughout the film perhaps but in the one scene he has with Piven in the bathroom I did think that he showed potential to do more than just be in this sort of thing. Time will tell if he can move away form just being a good looking guy with a deep voice, but he did seem in touch with his character here.\n\nOverall though, the film is nothing to write home about. With an inconsistent approach that sees approach markedly changed abruptly not once but twice, the film is hard to stick with. It probably offers enough noise and narrative to please those looking for noise and violence but personally I was disappointed and found it hard to care that much about."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142150,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2007-03-14","keywords":"mafia,casino,mob hit,sniper,apostrophe in title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17612313","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ5ZmFlYTEtNzVjMy00ZGY1LTk5YTctODJjYTA2OTI2MGI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ5ZmFlYTEtNzVjMy00ZGY1LTk5YTctODJjYTA2OTI2MGI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005315/","name":"Jeremy Piven"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000501/","name":"Ray Liotta"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0138620/","name":"Joe Carnahan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0138620/","name":"Joe Carnahan"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A Vegas entertainer once, he got to know the local mob and was taken by the lifestyle to the point that he began his own crew. Unfortunately for him and everyone he knows, it has caught up with him and he now finds himself targeted by all sides and in the hands of the FBI, desperately trying to make a deal with them from the security of the penthouse floor of a luxury hotel. However the FBI pick up wind of a hit called in by Sparazza with a strict time limit, a $1,000,000 bounty and cut out Buddy's heart. It is not long before a handful of bounty hunters are heading towards the hotel with one aim  to be the first.\n\nOn a transatlantic flight during the day I had time for one more film before landing. As I was just trying to relax I was looking for undemanding stuff just to distract and entertain me. The film I watched first was Shooter and I mention this deliberately. Shooter was only an OK film but what it did was lay out its stall and make it very clear what it was going to do and how it was going to do it  not necessarily in terms of plotting but more in terms of style and approach. It wasn't great but it worked. I assumed that Smokin' Aces would do the same as the trailer made it look like a comic hit-man film  with hyper filming, lots of stars and lots of action.\n\nNow, if you're thinking that I shouldn't assume then you're right, but this is how the film starts and it is how it is at various stages across the film. However it goes from being a bit like Guy Richie (freeze frames, names on screen etc) to being an all out action fest, with guns everywhere and people surviving the way that they only do in action films. The suddenly in the final third it decides that it not going to be superficially comic or superficially action-packed and suddenly seemed to have an emotional side and expected me to care about the characters and their plights  like it had been a serious drama all along (although I'm not sure how I'm supposed to take the ADD kid with the erection in that context).\n\nIn doing this it does still do just about enough to keep a story going but to be honest I started to get bored as it changed tone based on whatever it want to do.

The timeline is set back to 1984. Skynet sends its own terminator from 2029, to kill Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), mother of future subversive leader of the resistance, John Connor (Jason Clarke). Consequently, a human, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is also sent to stop the terminator, in humanity's desperate hope to save their species.

The timeline is set back to 1984. Skynet sends its own terminator from 2029, to kill Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), mother of future subversive leader of the resistance, John Connor (Jason Clarke). Consequently, a human, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is also sent to stop the terminator, in humanity's desperate hope to save their species. At the time, Sarah is already being protected by her guardian terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), whose reasons of arriving in her time, is seemingly set to be never known.\n\nTime-travel has always been a fascinating subject, and it in such fashion that Terminator: Genisys, attempts to build its own stronghold in the mold of the first two films.

The screenplay is dumb. The acting is to say the least, average. The story is preposterous. Yet, as Ebert nicely put it, "I enjoyed this movie on its own dumb level, which must mean (I am forced to conclude) in my own dumb way". Yes, this is a film you should watch with your brain switched comfortably to the 'Off' position, a nice cold beer on the table and a bag of popcorn in your lap. When you come to think about it though, isn't that what movies are supposed to be all about in the first place?\n\nP.S. One thing worth mention though is the excellent cinematography. The movie is a wonderful African picture book, which definitely helps the overall experience.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95772,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2005-04-20","keywords":"beach,evil man,good versus evil,bare chested male,disguise","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sahara","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2089091353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDdlYjVlYjAtZTc2Ny00NzJjLWFlYjUtM2YyZjY3MjYyNGIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDdlYjVlYjAtZTc2Ny00NzJjLWFlYjUtM2YyZjY3MjYyNGIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000190/","name":"Matthew McConaughey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004851/","name":"Penélope Cruz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001872/","name":"Steve Zahn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0252135/","name":"Breck Eisner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129170/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0145519/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193774/","name":"Clive Cussler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0232776/","name":"Thomas Dean Donnelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0649191/","name":"Joshua Oppenheimer"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There's even a lesbian scene here (completely out of the blue and pointless) but they're always quite the eye candy.\n\nAll in all, not a good movie by any means but for fans of Steve it may be worth the hour and a half on a slow night.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4025,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-02-20","keywords":"low budget,pilot,terrorist,bomber,street shootout","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Flight of Fury","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2913403161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2NkNThjZmItYmJmNy00NDAyLTg4MDctNWZmOTRjM2UwYzYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2NkNThjZmItYmJmNy00NDAyLTg4MDctNWZmOTRjM2UwYzYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000219/","name":"Steven Seagal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0063303/","name":"Mark Bazeley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0869750/","name":"Steve Toussaint"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0450661/","name":"Michael Keusch"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020879/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003653/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000219/","name":"Steven Seagal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1546172/","name":"Joe Halpin"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In a journey of magic, adventure and family, the fiery Scot is launched into the ranks of the elite Disney princesses. \n\nAs odd and understandably foreign as the accents felt watching the early previews for the movie, the voice acting was executed following, creating very real characters that fit their animated molds perfectly. By the end of the movie, what once sounded foreign blended into the scenery and visuals to create a completely immersing environment.\n\nIn fact, amid the magic spells and tall tales of times gone by, it's the historical, Scottish feeling that made Marida's journey and transformation (and that of her mother) that much more tangible and familiar.\n\nUnderneath the folk-tale storyline lies the same life lessons that ring true for young and old. Though the movie heavily focuses on a mother- daughter relationship, it's not just for girls anymore than Mulan was. Merida is a true Disney princess, with gumption, heart and an uncanny connection with nature, but the story could have been told from a male perspective and rung just as true, making it easy to empathize with Pixar's first female lead.\n\nAs has been the case with almost every other one of their movies, the company has reinvented the standard for animated visuals. The environments are based on real Scottish landmarks, adding real depth to the story, and the colors are as bright as they are grounded, creating a wonderfully real world. Such visuals lend credence to the upcoming 3D re-release of Finding Nemo, though not much, but also show just how far the studio has come. \n\nAll of the elements put together, Brave is a different sort of movie than many were expecting. More focused on a single pair and their quest together, not to mention darker by far, the story of Merida was a leap of faith for the once small studio. \n\nMany will have their doubts, left wanting another heart wrenching love story from Up or creative take on a beat to death genre like The Incredibles. That was never the purpose.

In a journey of magic, adventure and family, the fiery Scot is launched into the ranks of the elite Disney princesses. \n\nAs odd and understandably foreign as the accents felt watching the early previews for the movie, the voice acting was executed following, creating very real characters that fit their animated molds perfectly. By the end of the movie, what once sounded foreign blended into the scenery and visuals to create a completely immersing environment.\n\nIn fact, amid the magic spells and tall tales of times gone by, it's the historical, Scottish feeling that made Marida's journey and transformation (and that of her mother) that much more tangible and familiar.\n\nUnderneath the folk-tale storyline lies the same life lessons that ring true for young and old. Though the movie heavily focuses on a mother- daughter relationship, it's not just for girls anymore than Mulan was. Merida is a true Disney princess, with gumption, heart and an uncanny connection with nature, but the story could have been told from a male perspective and rung just as true, making it easy to empathize with Pixar's first female lead.\n\nAs has been the case with almost every other one of their movies, the company has reinvented the standard for animated visuals. The environments are based on real Scottish landmarks, adding real depth to the story, and the colors are as bright as they are grounded, creating a wonderfully real world. Such visuals lend credence to the upcoming 3D re-release of Finding Nemo, though not much, but also show just how far the studio has come. \n\nAll of the elements put together, Brave is a different sort of movie than many were expecting. More focused on a single pair and their quest together, not to mention darker by far, the story of Merida was a leap of faith for the once small studio. \n\nMany will have their doubts, left wanting another heart wrenching love story from Up or creative take on a beat to death genre like The Incredibles. That was never the purpose. Just as with every one of their award-winning films (Cars 2 notwithstanding), a new movie means a new chapter, new story and new style of film.\n\nTaken for what it is, Brave is a remarkable step into a whole new style of movie, proving the creative teams at Pixar will continue to write their own fate.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":390617,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-08-15","keywords":"princess,mother daughter relationship,archery,female warrior,rebellious daughter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Families Legend","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi678863641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTM4NTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA4MDI3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTM4NTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA4MDI3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Determined to make her own path in life, Princess Merida defies a custom that brings chaos to her kingdom.

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-23","keywords":"computer,father daughter relationship,apple computer,dialogue driven,1990s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424367385","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs' career -- beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998 -- Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410596/","name":"Walter Isaacson"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Nemilosrdni i lukavi general Aulo Plaucije odlučniji je no ikad da osvoji ovu mitsku zemlju na krajnjem rubu Rimskog Carstva.

First time director Joe Wright has worked with television playwright Deborah Moggach's script and a wonderful collection of mainly British actors to delight us. The versatile camera-work, luscious countryside, grand settings, period costumes, and atmospheric music are evidence of a work on which much love has been lavished.\n\nAt the heart of this triumph is the delightful 20 year old Keira Knightley as the assured and sharp Elizabeth Bennett, the second of five daughters looking to be married off by an anxious mother. Knightley's rise in the thespian firmament has been meteoric and this is her best performance to date in a role for which she is perfectly cast. Matthew MacFadyen is suitably brooding and gauche as Mr Darcy, but the cast list is enlivened with splendid British character actors, including Brenda Blethyn as Lizzie's irascible mother, Tom Hollander as a diminutive cleric seeking a wife, and Judi Dench as the formidable Lady Catherine, plus the Canadian Donald Sutherland (Lizzie's wise father).\n\nThis is a Georgian world in which social conventions present a veritable minefield for indiscretions or misunderstandings and in which a formal dance can be as intricate an occasion as international diplomacy. Pride and prejudice are only two of the obstacles to be overcome before inevitably true love brings Lizzie and her dark knight nose to nose (we don't even see a kiss). Passionate stuff indeed."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":275936,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"pride and prejudice,england,gentleman,bachelor,prejudice","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pride &amp; Prejudice","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3045130521","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOTY1MDktM2IxMy00MTA4LWI4NjEtNWM1ZjNmMWJmMzkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOTY1MDktM2IxMy00MTA4LWI4NjEtNWM1ZjNmMWJmMzkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Focus Features"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532193/","name":"Matthew Macfadyen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000950/","name":"Brenda Blethyn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942504/","name":"Joe Wright"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0595738/","name":"Deborah Moggach"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000807/","name":"Jane Austen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000668/","name":"Emma Thompson"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

First time director Joe Wright has worked with television playwright Deborah Moggach's script and a wonderful collection of mainly British actors to delight us. The versatile camera-work, luscious countryside, grand settings, period costumes, and atmospheric music are evidence of a work on which much love has been lavished.\n\nAt the heart of this triumph is the delightful 20 year old Keira Knightley as the assured and sharp Elizabeth Bennett, the second of five daughters looking to be married off by an anxious mother. Knightley's rise in the thespian firmament has been meteoric and this is her best performance to date in a role for which she is perfectly cast. Matthew MacFadyen is suitably brooding and gauche as Mr Darcy, but the cast list is enlivened with splendid British character actors, including Brenda Blethyn as Lizzie's irascible mother, Tom Hollander as a diminutive cleric seeking a wife, and Judi Dench as the formidable Lady Catherine, plus the Canadian Donald Sutherland (Lizzie's wise father).\n\nThis is a Georgian world in which social conventions present a veritable minefield for indiscretions or misunderstandings and in which a formal dance can be as intricate an occasion as international diplomacy. Pride and prejudice are only two of the obstacles to be overcome before inevitably true love brings Lizzie and her dark knight nose to nose (we don't even see a kiss). Passionate stuff indeed.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":275936,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"pride and prejudice,england,gentleman,bachelor,prejudice","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pride &amp; Prejudice","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3045130521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOTY1MDktM2IxMy00MTA4LWI4NjEtNWM1ZjNmMWJmMzkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOTY1MDktM2IxMy00MTA4LWI4NjEtNWM1ZjNmMWJmMzkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Focus Features","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532193/","name":"Matthew Macfadyen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000950/","name":"Brenda Blethyn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942504/","name":"Joe Wright"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0595738/","name":"Deborah Moggach","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000807/","name":"Jane Austen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000668/","name":"Emma Thompson"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Vjerojatno omiljena filmska franšiza jedne generacije, Rocky je svačiji omiljeni austajder. Ono što se događalo iza kamere jednako je fascinantno; Sylvester Stallone bio je gotovo nepoznati glumac sa snom. Poput svog lika u filmu, Sylvester je izašao na kraj s izazovom svog života i svijetu podario ovaj legendarni serijal. Pogledajte kako nas sam Sylvester Stallone vodi kroz kućne filmove i snimke iza kulisa kao da smo u njegovoj dnevnoj sobi i gledamo to zajedno s njim. Ovaj intimni dokumentarac potpisuje nevjerojatno nadareni, nagrađivani redatelj Derek Wayne Johnson.</desc>

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.\n\nWhat a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.\n\n"Crouching Tiger...", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia!") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.\n\nIn this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called "wire work" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of "Crouching Tiger...", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of "Matrix."  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...\n\nAt other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.\n\nApart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.\n\nAnd, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.\n\nChow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.\n\nThe center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the "Luke Skywalker" of the piece, if you will...though "Crouching Tiger..." has everything the "Star Wars" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.\n\nBy the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the "Full Peckinpaw," if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.\n\nThere are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.

A young Chinese warrior steals a sword from a famed swordsman and then escapes into a world of romantic adventure with a mysterious man in the frontier of the nation." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0190332/","name":"Wo hu cang long","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdhMzMxOTctNDMyNS00NTZmLTljNWEtNTc4MDBmZTYxY2NmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young Chinese warrior steals a sword from a famed swordsman and then escapes into a world of romantic adventure with a mysterious man in the frontier of the nation.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0190332/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Larry-17","dateCreated":"2001-01-16","inLanguage":"English","name":"Magical Romance...","reviewBody":"There's a telling moment near the beginning of Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."\n\nIn closeup, we see the rough-hewn, heavy wooden wheels of a peasant cart. They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.\n\nWhat a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.\n\n"Crouching Tiger...", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia!") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.\n\nIn this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called "wire work" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of "Crouching Tiger...", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of "Matrix."  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...\n\nAt other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.\n\nApart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.\n\nAnd, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.\n\nChow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.\n\nThe center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the "Luke Skywalker" of the piece, if you will...though "Crouching Tiger..." has everything the "Star Wars" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.\n\nBy the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the "Full Peckinpaw," if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.\n\nThere are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!\n\nI won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.\n\nMy recommendation: Just go see it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The new millennium has given birth to two of the greatest franchise ( Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings) that cinema has seen since the original Star Wars.Its very rare to witness not only one film masterpiece, but two is just extraordinary. The Harry Potter films contain the best story telling, action, human connection to the audience and bring out the most emotion of the characters I have ever seen in a franchise. Its amazing to see the transition that the Harry Potter films have taken from innocence kid friendly movies, to when our generation matured, so did the films. They became more dark and more developed with intensity of story and character building. This film is fulfilling, sad and satisfying. The factor that has kept these movies looking amazing is the cinematography and effect that have stayed constant through the film through the years. The film has those two elements and more working for it which makes it the best film in the Potter franchise. This franchise has kept it's flame burning strong for 10 years and director David Yates sends this Wizard series away in the best fashion it could achieve. This movie has to be the best out of the 8 films and combined everything that someone would be looking for in a Harry Potter film and also displays everything that fans of the series have been looking for and that the amount of action.I thought that Transformers Dark of the Moon delivered the most action of the summer and I was wrong. Harry Potter gives the audience the most action that a film can contain combined with the highest level of emotion I have ever seen.Deathly Hollows Part 2 contains the most heart, pure emotion and extreme action I have ever seen in cinema since the original Star Wars. The pacing of this film does not let the audience catch their breath when witnessing this masterpiece. Their is so much to see and so much to take in that if you blink you will miss out something great. This movie delivers everything that someone from critics and fans would be looking for in a close out film. All credit in my opinion goes to the director, David Yates, for bringing this kid friendly movie up to speed with the maturity level that the books brought over the course of their time. Yates and all director of the franchise did the best job transforming the JK Rowling book series into box office hits that has been accepted warmly by fans and critic. But by far David Yates has done the best job of pulling emotions out of his cast, making them relateable to the audience and creating a certain tone for the viewer to witness and grasps the gravity that is going on in the closing journey of Harry Potter. He has done the best job of well rounding his movies that they are not only entertaining, but also makes the audience yearn for more Harry Potter films. I also give a lot of credit to the main cast members from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Ralph Fiennes. They all have done a great job of shaping the memories of the famous novel character into visual ones that have made an imprint into the viewers mind and they have done the best jobs that young to old actors can do with this sort of property. They are all equally nice to watch and bring so much passion to the film that the audience cant help, but notice dedication to the movies.It's not only the main characters that show the greatest acting and hear, but also the secondary actors bring a lot to the film and all pleasant to watching. This movie franchise is made it's mark in the world of cinema as one of the greatest series that have ever been viewed and this film wraps the franchise up in the best way possible. This is possibly the best film of the year and of the past 10 years. All good things do come to a end sooner or later and it has been a heck of a journey, and I?M)m glad I was able to experience it."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":809914,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Fantasy","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2011-07-13","keywords":"ginny weasley character,lucius malfoy character,hermione granger character,twins,child","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi128621593","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcwODM5NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA4MTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcwODM5NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA4MTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The end begins as Harry, Ron, and Hermione go back to Hogwarts to find and destroy Voldemort's final horcruxes, but when Voldemort finds out about their mission, the biggest battle begins and life as they know it will never be the same again.

The scenes and animation is breathtaking. I liked that very much.\n\nHere's a controversial opinion; I quite liked the music and songs as well though It lacks the iconic catchy tunes from the first one.\n\nMy biggest complaint and the one thing that let this down is the story. Its way too simplistic. Now granted the first one wasn't Mark-Twain like either but you get the feeling that it was more substantial than this and as an adult there was more in the first one for you than this.\n\nI'm still rating this pretty good because as much as I'm personally underwhelmed by the story, I'm not the target audience. This is a movie for little children and I guess they might have a different opinion. I wouldn't know for sure since I dont have children to take to the movies. I would like to, but I need to find a wife first for that to happen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":154425,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-11-22","keywords":"autumn,anthropomorphic snowman,princess,disney animated sequel,magic","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Frozen II Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2143993625","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmNkNWYwYzItNzJhMi00YjljLTkxODMtODRlODQ2ZWE1ZTJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmNkNWYwYzItNzJhMi00YjljLTkxODMtODRlODQ2ZWE1ZTJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068338/","name":"Kristen Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0579953/","name":"Idina Menzel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1265802/","name":"Josh Gad"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0118333/","name":"Chris Buck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1601644/","name":"Jennifer Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074039/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1601644/","name":"Jennifer Lee"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0026153/","name":"Hans Christian Andersen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0118333/","name":"Chris Buck"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The scenes and animation is breathtaking. I liked that very much.\n\nHere's a controversial opinion; I quite liked the music and songs as well though It lacks the iconic catchy tunes from the first one.\n\nMy biggest complaint and the one thing that let this down is the story. Its way too simplistic. Now granted the first one wasn't Mark-Twain like either but you get the feeling that it was more substantial than this and as an adult there was more in the first one for you than this.\n\nI'm still rating this pretty good because as much as I'm personally underwhelmed by the story, I'm not the target audience. This is a movie for little children and I guess they might have a different opinion. I wouldn't know for sure since I dont have children to take to the movies. I would like to, but I need to find a wife first for that to happen.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":154425,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-11-22","keywords":"autumn,anthropomorphic snowman,princess,disney animated sequel,magic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Frozen II Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2143993625","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmNkNWYwYzItNzJhMi00YjljLTkxODMtODRlODQ2ZWE1ZTJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmNkNWYwYzItNzJhMi00YjljLTkxODMtODRlODQ2ZWE1ZTJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068338/","name":"Kristen Bell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0579953/","name":"Idina Menzel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1265802/","name":"Josh Gad"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0118333/","name":"Chris Buck","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1601644/","name":"Jennifer Lee"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074039/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1601644/","name":"Jennifer Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0026153/","name":"Hans Christian Andersen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0118333/","name":"Chris Buck"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Specifically it is a portrait of one man, Dominic Cummings (Benedict Cumberbatch), the director of the "Leave" campaign, or the campaign to exit the EU. I wasn't sure why the side story of the Cummings marriage and pregnancy was included at first, but later it becomes clear that Cummings would have come across as a statistician/political version of House, M.D. if that humanizing story was not present.\n\nCummings enlists the help of a tiny Canadian IT company - Aggregate IQ - to do data mining of social media for the "Leave" campaign, and they come up with three million potential Brexit voters that the "Remain" campaign (campaign to remain in the EU) knows nothing about. Cummings' strategy involves tenets of Sun Tzu's "Art of War" , specifically forcing the "Remain" campaign to "fight in the darkness", or wherever the "Leave" campaign chose them to fight. Specifically Britain has an equal time policy when it comes to political messages. So the Remain campaign would have a Nobel prize winning economist explaining the downside to leaving the EU in complex terms, and then the Leave side would talk about millions of Turks possibly emigrating to the UK, forcing the Remain side to waste time on trying to debunk that message.\n\nIt is up the viewer as to whether this tale is humorous or frightening, I think it is a little bit of both. On the frightening side you have political campaigns becoming the equivalent of the evil presence in the 1982 film Poltergeist - it knows what scares you. On the humorous side you see the frustration of the Remain side as the Leave side will simply not play by the rules. And kudos to the guy playing Boris Johnson.

 --- Description: Brexit: The Uncivil War: Directed by Toby Haynes. With Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Belcher, Malcolm Freeman, Lucy Russell.

Specifically it is a portrait of one man, Dominic Cummings (Benedict Cumberbatch), the director of the "Leave" campaign, or the campaign to exit the EU. I wasn't sure why the side story of the Cummings marriage and pregnancy was included at first, but later it becomes clear that Cummings would have come across as a statistician/political version of House, M.D. if that humanizing story was not present.\n\nCummings enlists the help of a tiny Canadian IT company - Aggregate IQ - to do data mining of social media for the "Leave" campaign, and they come up with three million potential Brexit voters that the "Remain" campaign (campaign to remain in the EU) knows nothing about. Cummings' strategy involves tenets of Sun Tzu's "Art of War" , specifically forcing the "Remain" campaign to "fight in the darkness", or wherever the "Leave" campaign chose them to fight. Specifically Britain has an equal time policy when it comes to political messages. So the Remain campaign would have a Nobel prize winning economist explaining the downside to leaving the EU in complex terms, and then the Leave side would talk about millions of Turks possibly emigrating to the UK, forcing the Remain side to waste time on trying to debunk that message.\n\nIt is up the viewer as to whether this tale is humorous or frightening, I think it is a little bit of both. On the frightening side you have political campaigns becoming the equivalent of the evil presence in the 1982 film Poltergeist - it knows what scares you. On the humorous side you see the frustration of the Remain side as the Leave side will simply not play by the rules. And kudos to the guy playing Boris Johnson. He looked just like him.\n\nI'm only knocking one point off this almost perfect film because it had quite a bit of stuff that the viewer was just assumed to know. For example it kept talking about "MPs". In the US that is "Military Police". In the UK it is "Members of Parliament".

I loved it. \n\nIt did have one irritating thing, though, kind of a big one. It pointed most of the accolades to Affleck's character and the CIA. This really was not true. It was Ken Taylor and the Canadians who really pulled 'the Canadian Caper' off so successfully.\n\n"When Taylor heard a few years ago that Mendez had sold movie rights to his book (which, to be fair, is much more generous than the movie about Canada's role), "I said, 'Well, that's going to be interesting.'...."The movie's fun, it's thrilling, it's pertinent, it's timely," he said.

Yes, it's based on a true story - the movie does it's best to allude that it sticks to technical accuracy. And it really does, in some ways. Historical pictures of flag burners, rioters, gate climbers, etc.. up against Argo film stills run by during the credits make it seem that the facts were adhered to down to the tiniest detail. In reality, it wasn't Tony Mendez or the CIA who were responsible for the success of this operation; actually they were barely there. \n\nSince the movie premiered, Ben Affleck has added emphasis on the movie postscripts since then that gives kudos to the Canadians' role. This was after Ken Taylor politely complained, as a Canadian would tactfully do. But Affleck did this only after pressure from Taylor himself.\n\nI can understand the need to spice up events to make them as exciting and entertaining as possible, don't get me wrong.

I scanned some of the user reviews and for all those giving a very low rating it seems to me that they missed the essence of Cinderella - it is not supposed to be an action nor hard/boiled tale that apparently even some children want today and should not become such.\n\nI particularly appreciated the stepmother's portrayal because it included clear justification for her anger and bitterness. Not to say given that justification she was correct to have done what she did. But a worthy lesson for us and particularly for children.\n\nThe specific scene I am referring to is when she overhears her husband telling his daughter how much he misses her mother, i.e., where is the love and support she desires - a more modern understanding of the difficulty of joining an existing family. This and other related scenes gives the stepmother a depth that makes her more real in place of the one-dimensional cartoon version - but what a joy that version was for me many years ago.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":169768,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2015-03-13","keywords":"dance,remake,fairy tale,prince,pumpkin","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi604089881","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU5Mjk4NjAyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDM4MDI0NDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU5Mjk4NjAyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDM4MDI0NDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A live-action retelling of the classic fairy tale about a servant step-daughter who wins the heart of a prince.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4141252/","name":"Lily James"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0534635/","name":"Richard Madden"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000110/","name":"Kenneth Branagh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0446409/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0465725/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0301801/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919363/","name":"Chris Weitz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0674518/","name":"Charles Perrault"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I scanned some of the user reviews and for all those giving a very low rating it seems to me that they missed the essence of Cinderella - it is not supposed to be an action nor hard/boiled tale that apparently even some children want today and should not become such.\n\nI particularly appreciated the stepmother's portrayal because it included clear justification for her anger and bitterness. Not to say given that justification she was correct to have done what she did. But a worthy lesson for us and particularly for children.\n\nThe specific scene I am referring to is when she overhears her husband telling his daughter how much he misses her mother, i.e., where is the love and support she desires - a more modern understanding of the difficulty of joining an existing family. This and other related scenes gives the stepmother a depth that makes her more real in place of the one-dimensional cartoon version - but what a joy that version was for me many years ago.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":169768,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2015-03-13","keywords":"dance,remake,fairy tale,prince,pumpkin","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi604089881","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU5Mjk4NjAyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDM4MDI0NDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU5Mjk4NjAyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDM4MDI0NDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A live-action retelling of the classic fairy tale about a servant step-daughter who wins the heart of a prince.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4141252/","name":"Lily James","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0534635/","name":"Richard Madden"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000110/","name":"Kenneth Branagh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0446409/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0465725/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0301801/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919363/","name":"Chris Weitz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0674518/","name":"Charles Perrault"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Specifically it is a portrait of one man, Dominic Cummings (Benedict Cumberbatch), the director of the "Leave" campaign, or the campaign to exit the EU. I wasn't sure why the side story of the Cummings marriage and pregnancy was included at first, but later it becomes clear that Cummings would have come across as a statistician/political version of House, M.D. if that humanizing story was not present.\n\nCummings enlists the help of a tiny Canadian IT company - Aggregate IQ - to do data mining of social media for the "Leave" campaign, and they come up with three million potential Brexit voters that the "Remain" campaign (campaign to remain in the EU) knows nothing about. Cummings' strategy involves tenets of Sun Tzu's "Art of War" , specifically forcing the "Remain" campaign to "fight in the darkness", or wherever the "Leave" campaign chose them to fight. Specifically Britain has an equal time policy when it comes to political messages. So the Remain campaign would have a Nobel prize winning economist explaining the downside to leaving the EU in complex terms, and then the Leave side would talk about millions of Turks possibly emigrating to the UK, forcing the Remain side to waste time on trying to debunk that message.\n\nIt is up the viewer as to whether this tale is humorous or frightening, I think it is a little bit of both. On the frightening side you have political campaigns becoming the equivalent of the evil presence in the 1982 film Poltergeist - it knows what scares you. On the humorous side you see the frustration of the Remain side as the Leave side will simply not play by the rules. And kudos to the guy playing Boris Johnson.

Rosario Dawson plays the yardmaster that assists from headquarters while Jessy Schram plays the separated wife of the newbie conductor.\n\nThe movie's based on the real-life CSX 8888 Incident, otherwise known as the Crazy Eights Incident, which involved a runaway freight train in northwestern Ohio in 2001. Locomotive #8888 was pulling 47 cars, including some with hazardous chemicals, and ran unmanned for two hours and 66 miles at speeds of up to 51 mph. (***Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know how the real-life incident ended before seeing the movie***). Attempts to derail the train using a portable derailer failed, as did an attempt by police to shoot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which didn't work because the button has to be pressed for several seconds before the engine shuts down due to lack of fuel. A northbound freight train took succor in a siding area where the crew released its locomotive and waited for the runaway to pass. Like in the movie, they had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, a relative neophyte conductor. They proceeded to chase the runaway train and successfully locked on to the rear car of the runaway, then slowing it by applying the dynamic brakes or their locomotive. Once the runaway had slowed to 11 miles per hour, trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train, jumped on, and shut down the engine.\n\nWhile the movie starts somewhat bland it quickly picks up momentum for a realistic non-stop thrill ride. The realism is refreshing in this day and age of cartoony action blockbusters and their multiple "yeah, right" action scenes (not that there's anything wrong with those movies, as long as you're in the right mode). Washington and Pine make for good protagonists and you start to care about them as the story progresses. Moreover, the movie doesn't overstay its welcome at a mere 98 minutes.\n\nThe film was shot in numerous locations extending from central Pennsylvania to eastern Ohio, which serve up a nice rolling hills backdrop with the occasional river. Minor note: You'll observe a woodchuck scamper across the tracks in one scene where he/she thankfully DOESN'T become ground chuck.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: "Unstoppable" is worthwhile as a believable disaster thriller. While it lacks the potent subtext and overall greatness of 1985's "Runaway Train," it makes up for it with its realistic and kinetic tone, not to mention the fact that it's based on a true incident.\n\nGRADE: B","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-11-10","keywords":"train,runaway train,train engineer,freight train,train movie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Unstoppable: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3068790297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A rail company frantically works to prevent an unmanned, half-mile-long freight train carrying combustible liquids and poisonous gas from wiping out a city."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276484/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093560/","name":"Mark Bomback"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Rosario Dawson plays the yardmaster that assists from headquarters while Jessy Schram plays the separated wife of the newbie conductor.\n\nThe movie's based on the real-life CSX 8888 Incident, otherwise known as the Crazy Eights Incident, which involved a runaway freight train in northwestern Ohio in 2001. Locomotive #8888 was pulling 47 cars, including some with hazardous chemicals, and ran unmanned for two hours and 66 miles at speeds of up to 51 mph. (***Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know how the real-life incident ended before seeing the movie***). Attempts to derail the train using a portable derailer failed, as did an attempt by police to shoot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which didn't work because the button has to be pressed for several seconds before the engine shuts down due to lack of fuel. A northbound freight train took succor in a siding area where the crew released its locomotive and waited for the runaway to pass. Like in the movie, they had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, a relative neophyte conductor. They proceeded to chase the runaway train and successfully locked on to the rear car of the runaway, then slowing it by applying the dynamic brakes or their locomotive. Once the runaway had slowed to 11 miles per hour, trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train, jumped on, and shut down the engine.\n\nWhile the movie starts somewhat bland it quickly picks up momentum for a realistic non-stop thrill ride.

Let's start with the easy stuff. There are way too many references and bad puns. Some reviewers would call these references "jokes the adults can understand", and while that is true, they aren't funny. They're just kind of there. They are references that exist for you to say "I get that". There is no "ha" preceding that. Yes, the original also had references and bad puns, but they were used well and there weren't nearly as many. The first LEGO movie was very self aware, but it had a soul that really seemed to care about what it was saying. The second LEGO movie was so self aware that it was very difficult to take seriously. There was an obvious message about how growing up should be about learning to work with different people, but it kind of fell flat beneath the veil of "play with others even if you don't like how they play". It honestly made me a little angry. Maybe it wasn't intentional, but the film seemed to suggest that traditionally masculine things are incapable of being imaginative. I couldn't help but feel a pinch of modern social politics biting for my throat. The first film felt very apolitical, and I believe that's fitting for a film about a franchise of toys that cradled our imaginations before we cared about politics. This film certainly didn't "ruin my childhood" by any means, but it was a disappointment.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60966,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-02-07","keywords":"lego,sequel,queen,spaceship,vampire","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2788407833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It's been five years since everything was awesome and the citizens are facing a huge new threat: LEGO DUPLO invaders from outer space, wrecking everything faster than they can rebuild.

Let's start with the easy stuff. There are way too many references and bad puns. Some reviewers would call these references "jokes the adults can understand", and while that is true, they aren't funny. They're just kind of there. They are references that exist for you to say "I get that". There is no "ha" preceding that. Yes, the original also had references and bad puns, but they were used well and there weren't nearly as many. The first LEGO movie was very self aware, but it had a soul that really seemed to care about what it was saying. The second LEGO movie was so self aware that it was very difficult to take seriously. There was an obvious message about how growing up should be about learning to work with different people, but it kind of fell flat beneath the veil of "play with others even if you don't like how they play". It honestly made me a little angry. Maybe it wasn't intentional, but the film seemed to suggest that traditionally masculine things are incapable of being imaginative. I couldn't help but feel a pinch of modern social politics biting for my throat. The first film felt very apolitical, and I believe that's fitting for a film about a franchise of toys that cradled our imaginations before we cared about politics. This film certainly didn't "ruin my childhood" by any means, but it was a disappointment.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60966,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-02-07","keywords":"lego,sequel,queen,spaceship,vampire","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2788407833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It's been five years since everything was awesome and the citizens are facing a huge new threat: LEGO DUPLO invaders from outer space, wrecking everything faster than they can rebuild.

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One of the aspects I love most about Return of the King, my favourite of Jackson's adaptations and one of my favourite films of all time, is the sprawling, mass fantasy battle scenes and The Battle of Five Armies is pretty much one elongated battle scene. However, there's something that's not quite right.\n\nIt's not the lack of emotion, characterization or plot. Indeed, there are plenty of those, there is just something I just can't put my finger on that stops the film from being truly epic. Perhaps it is because, for me at least, this film will always live in King's shadow but, really, where I think the film falls down, is that the battles simply aren't done well enough. The context is not explained very well, the actual engagements not that exciting too much repetition and, most crucially, too much cutting away from one place to another. This cutting worked fine, well, even, in Two Towers between the crucible of Helm's Deep and the quiet conversation of the Entmoot, but, here, there are just too many places that the actions flits between. I appreciate this is a battle of five armies, and that there are plenty of characters, but, sadly, the action did seem to be all over the place. And the repetition I mentioned earlier: a huge portion of the film seemed to be entirely composed of either someone running to warn others, a main character leading the charge into battle, and several one-on-one battles. The latter may be entertaining, sure, but there is a line which is stepped over in this film.\n\nThe ending, too, seemed like it was rushed by the filmmakers, especially when we consider that we don't actually find out what happens to the Arkenstone in the end. Many people criticised Return of the King's dragged out ending, but that was full of emotion and was a fitting, yet sad, farewell. Here, where not only does Bilbo say farewell to Gandalf and the Dwarfs, but where we say an almost certain farewell to Middle Earth, the end is far too brief and unlikely to instil emotion. Though, it is, to be fair, nicely linked into Fellowship.\n\nUltimately though, the film has plenty of positives. Despite being full of battle sequences, Jackson fits in plenty of emotional scenes and develops many of the characters fantastically.

One of the aspects I love most about Return of the King, my favourite of Jackson's adaptations and one of my favourite films of all time, is the sprawling, mass fantasy battle scenes and The Battle of Five Armies is pretty much one elongated battle scene. However, there's something that's not quite right.\n\nIt's not the lack of emotion, characterization or plot. Indeed, there are plenty of those, there is just something I just can't put my finger on that stops the film from being truly epic. Perhaps it is because, for me at least, this film will always live in King's shadow but, really, where I think the film falls down, is that the battles simply aren't done well enough. The context is not explained very well, the actual engagements not that exciting too much repetition and, most crucially, too much cutting away from one place to another. This cutting worked fine, well, even, in Two Towers between the crucible of Helm's Deep and the quiet conversation of the Entmoot, but, here, there are just too many places that the actions flits between. I appreciate this is a battle of five armies, and that there are plenty of characters, but, sadly, the action did seem to be all over the place. And the repetition I mentioned earlier: a huge portion of the film seemed to be entirely composed of either someone running to warn others, a main character leading the charge into battle, and several one-on-one battles. The latter may be entertaining, sure, but there is a line which is stepped over in this film.\n\nThe ending, too, seemed like it was rushed by the filmmakers, especially when we consider that we don't actually find out what happens to the Arkenstone in the end. Many people criticised Return of the King's dragged out ending, but that was full of emotion and was a fitting, yet sad, farewell. Here, where not only does Bilbo say farewell to Gandalf and the Dwarfs, but where we say an almost certain farewell to Middle Earth, the end is far too brief and unlikely to instil emotion. Though, it is, to be fair, nicely linked into Fellowship.\n\nUltimately though, the film has plenty of positives. Despite being full of battle sequences, Jackson fits in plenty of emotional scenes and develops many of the characters fantastically. In particular, Armitage's Thorin is different and darker, yet changes a great deal throughout the film - all in all, a fantastic performance. There's plenty of typical Jackson humour, some brilliant cameos and some great nods to the Lord of the Rings films and some elements of the film's production, which die-hard fans will no doubt pick up on with a smile. It's also important to realise that, whilst it's easy to criticise the long battle sequences, they are entertaining, and keep the pace of the film up throughout.\n\nSo, whilst it is easy to concentrate on the negatives and, in particular, the lack of a Grey Havens-esque adieu to Middle Earth, The Battle of Five Armies is still a great film and a fitting end to what has been a true achievement: a series of beautiful film adaptations that many will be sad to see end.\n\n\n* Ed\n","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":497786,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2014-12-12","keywords":"middle earth,army,epic,hobbit,epic battle","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer ","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1092005657","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTk3MDk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc0MDgzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTk3MDk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc0MDgzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Bilbo and Company are forced to be embraced in a war against an armed flock of combatants and the terrifying Smaug from acquiring a kingdom of treasure and obliterating all of Middle-Earth.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0293509/","name":"Martin Freeman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0035514/","name":"Richard Armitage"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909638/","name":"Fran Walsh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0101991/","name":"Philippa Boyens","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

HBO donosi premijeru nove sezone "Emmyjem" nagrađene humoristične serije autora Armanda Iannuccija koja na oštar i satiričan način promatra zatvoreni politički svijet Washingtona. U seriji pratimo vrtoglavu svakodnevicu potpredsjednice Seline Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus u ulozi koja joj je donijela "Emmy") dok balansira sa svojim pretrpanim javnim rasporedom, gasi političke požare i brani predsjednikove interese, te istodobno pokušava popraviti svoj disfunkcionalni odnos s njime. Priča se nastavlja usred izbora u sredini mandata, a u 2. sezoni Selina kotira malo iznad prosjeka na nekoliko anketa o popularnosti, što iskorištava kako bi povećala svoj utjecaj i ulagivala se predsjedniku i njegovu novom glavnom strategu Kentu Davisonu (Gary Cole).</desc>

I am sure Dystopia will do very well internationally!\n\nIf you like Horror tension and at the same time mystery tension you should see Dystopia.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2300,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2021-06-13","keywords":"lesbian kiss,lesbian sex,topless female nudity,larp,larpers","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11198177/","name":"Lola Zackow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4477198/","name":"Madeleine Martin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7154476/","name":"Johan Hafezi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004517/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

"Pravi detektiv" vraća se s trećom sezonom koja se usredotočuje na novi slučaj i predstavlja impresivnu novu glumačku postavu. Mahershala Ali igra glavnu ulogu Waynea Haysa, umirovljenog detektiva kojeg 35 godina muči slučaj nestanka 12-godišnjeg dječaka i njegove 10-godišnje sestre u gradu West Finger u Arkansasu. Dok ostarjeli Hays kontemplira o svojoj istrazi s producentom dokumentarca o stvarnim zločinima, saznajemo više o slučaju i Haysovoj prošlosti prateći priče iz 1980., kad se zločin dogodio, i 1990., kad je šokantno otkriće ponovno probudilo interes za slučaj. Kroz ove flashbackove upoznajemo ključne likove poput Rolanda Westa, Wayneova partnera u vrijeme ubojstva; Amelije Reardon, učiteljice kao i okružne dužnosnike, FBI-eve agente, članove obitelji i osumnjičene.</desc>

Now, the better part of a decade later, the series is back, and it hasn't changed much at all. If you enjoyed the original, you'll probably like this one. If not, steer clear. That said, I enjoyed Rise of an Empire more than its predecessor, for two main reasons. The first is that I didn't know how it would end. Even before 300 came out, people knew about Thermopylae and the futile last stand that happened there. It made it too difficult to invest in the characters, and essentially forced me to sit drumming my fingers until their inevitable death. This was, fortunately, not the case here. The second reason is Eva Green. Best known for her breakout role in 2006's Casino Royale, her performance in Rise of an Empire ranges from terrifyingly understated to unintentionally comic, and steals the spotlight at every opportunity. But even she cannot hold up this movie by herself, since the film, for all its merits, relies on little more than its visual effects and art direction.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":289929,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-03-05","keywords":"violent sex,greek,army,navy,antiquity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2982128409","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3Nzk5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg4OTAwMTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3Nzk5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg4OTAwMTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Greek general Themistokles attempts to unite all of Greece by leading the charge against invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia vengeful commander of the Persian navy."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0822982/","name":"Sullivan Stapleton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1200692/","name":"Eva Green"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0372176/","name":"Lena Headey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1729171/","name":"Noam Murro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199432/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0426500/","name":"Kurt Johnstad"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588340/","name":"Frank Miller"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now, the better part of a decade later, the series is back, and it hasn't changed much at all. If you enjoyed the original, you'll probably like this one. If not, steer clear. That said, I enjoyed Rise of an Empire more than its predecessor, for two main reasons. The first is that I didn't know how it would end. Even before 300 came out, people knew about Thermopylae and the futile last stand that happened there. It made it too difficult to invest in the characters, and essentially forced me to sit drumming my fingers until their inevitable death. This was, fortunately, not the case here. The second reason is Eva Green. Best known for her breakout role in 2006's Casino Royale, her performance in Rise of an Empire ranges from terrifyingly understated to unintentionally comic, and steals the spotlight at every opportunity. But even she cannot hold up this movie by herself, since the film, for all its merits, relies on little more than its visual effects and art direction.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":289929,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-03-05","keywords":"violent sex,greek,army,navy,antiquity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2982128409","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3Nzk5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg4OTAwMTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3Nzk5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg4OTAwMTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Greek general Themistokles attempts to unite all of Greece by leading the charge against invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia vengeful commander of the Persian navy.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0822982/","name":"Sullivan Stapleton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1200692/","name":"Eva Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0372176/","name":"Lena Headey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1729171/","name":"Noam Murro"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199432/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0426500/","name":"Kurt Johnstad","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588340/","name":"Frank Miller"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

To my surprise, it did not disappoint.\n\nNow, several years later after having watched all three of these "Rings" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts.

To my surprise, it did not disappoint.\n\nNow, several years later after having watched all three of these "Rings" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts.

HBO donosi premijeru nove sezone "Emmyjem" nagrađene humoristične serije autora Armanda Iannuccija koja na oštar i satiričan način promatra zatvoreni politički svijet Washingtona. U seriji pratimo vrtoglavu svakodnevicu potpredsjednice Seline Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus u ulozi koja joj je donijela "Emmy") dok balansira sa svojim pretrpanim javnim rasporedom, gasi političke požare i brani predsjednikove interese, te istodobno pokušava popraviti svoj disfunkcionalni odnos s njime. Priča se nastavlja usred izbora u sredini mandata, a u 2. sezoni Selina kotira malo iznad prosjeka na nekoliko anketa o popularnosti, što iskorištava kako bi povećala svoj utjecaj i ulagivala se predsjedniku i njegovu novom glavnom strategu Kentu Davisonu (Gary Cole).</desc>

Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.\n\nThis second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).\n\nGollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of "Smeagol" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...\n\nA truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.\n\nProbably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for "The Two Towers" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to "The Battle of Helms Deep", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.\n\nViggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. "Definitive" is not strong enough of a word.\n\nIf you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings "The Two Towers" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.\n\nGo, Laugh, Cry, and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1557139,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"middle earth,hobbit,epic,wizard,mission","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

"Pravi detektiv" vraća se s trećom sezonom koja se usredotočuje na novi slučaj i predstavlja impresivnu novu glumačku postavu. Mahershala Ali igra glavnu ulogu Waynea Haysa, umirovljenog detektiva kojeg 35 godina muči slučaj nestanka 12-godišnjeg dječaka i njegove 10-godišnje sestre u gradu West Finger u Arkansasu. Dok ostarjeli Hays kontemplira o svojoj istrazi s producentom dokumentarca o stvarnim zločinima, saznajemo više o slučaju i Haysovoj prošlosti prateći priče iz 1980., kad se zločin dogodio, i 1990., kad je šokantno otkriće ponovno probudilo interes za slučaj. Kroz ove flashbackove upoznajemo ključne likove poput Rolanda Westa, Wayneova partnera u vrijeme ubojstva; Amelije Reardon, učiteljice kao i okružne dužnosnike, FBI-eve agente, članove obitelji i osumnjičene.</desc>

Tu su i njezine tri prijateljice: Samantha Jones, vlasnica PR agencije, koju više zanima usputni seks nego dugotrajne veze, Miranda Hobbes, cinična odvjetnica kojoj je karijera ispred nestabilnog ljubavnog života i Charlotte York, kustosica u galeriji koja je mrvicu konzervativna kada je riječ o seksu, ali još nije izgubila vjeru u to da će pronaći pravu ljubav. Serija "Seks i grad" temelji se na uspješnici koju je napisala Candace Bushnell. Radnja se vrti oko života četiriju mladih, uspješnih žena u potrazi za savršenom vezom... I orgazmom!</desc>

I loved that show when it was on so i'm really enjoying Warehouse 13 but i was curious if it was just me. Of course, the set up is different but the whole cursed objects and having to retrieve them is dead on. I do like the government connection since i was a big fan of X-files! Hopefully this show will win viewers and we will be able to keep another good one on the air for a change, i'm just sick of the reality shows for now. Anyway, I plan to continue watching since they really aren't any other good shows on at the moment.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50251,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-07-07","keywords":"occult detective,supernatural power,artifact,steampunk,shared universe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565858/","name":"Eddie McClintock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1162399/","name":"Joanne Kelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007210/","name":"Saul Rubinek"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242101/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0282285/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0260870/","name":"Jane Espenson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609315/","name":"D.

It's an OK horror movie which provides a few scares and thrills. The problem is it should have been so much better. After all the premise-what is it that little children are scared of at night which could come out of the cupboard-is a good one,not totally original,but not too familiar either.\n\nAfter a genuinely scary opening,we have our usual setting up of plot and build up for a while,than the scares start again. There is one truly effective 'jump'involving one,than a whole room full of,ghost children.There has been a lot of criticism of the way films like this and The Grudge use lots of sudden shocks and images but it works for me! However,after this great scene,the film just had nowhere to go. The hero must confront his fear,and that's it. The filmmakers attempt to atone for this by having it's characters constantly passing from one place to another in a kind of teleportation but it becomes overused and laughable. The weak climax is not scary and considerably weakened by MTV-style directing so you can't see whats always going on {a bugbear of much recent cinema}.

It's an OK horror movie which provides a few scares and thrills. The problem is it should have been so much better. After all the premise-what is it that little children are scared of at night which could come out of the cupboard-is a good one,not totally original,but not too familiar either.\n\nAfter a genuinely scary opening,we have our usual setting up of plot and build up for a while,than the scares start again. There is one truly effective 'jump'involving one,than a whole room full of,ghost children.There has been a lot of criticism of the way films like this and The Grudge use lots of sudden shocks and images but it works for me! However,after this great scene,the film just had nowhere to go. The hero must confront his fear,and that's it. The filmmakers attempt to atone for this by having it's characters constantly passing from one place to another in a kind of teleportation but it becomes overused and laughable. The weak climax is not scary and considerably weakened by MTV-style directing so you can't see whats always going on a bugbear of much recent cinema. Still,at least the monster is only shown briefly,making it more effective.\n\nYou could do probably do worse than see Boogeyman,it holds the attention for the first half at least and it's a good one for teenagers who want to be scared a bit but not actually disturbed. However,after it's over you may just want to cry "is that it?".

I have. It was one of those movies that you watch once and don't really ever think about again. However, I liked the idea behind it and I'm a big fan of supernatural horror movies so, when I heard there was a "Boogeyman 2" I thought I'd check it out.\n\nThis is not the movie I expected. In fact, I feel quite deceived. More on that later.\n\nAfter a quite tense opening sequence where Laura (Renee O'Connor) first encounters the Boogeyman as a child, the movie moves onto the main storyline. Whereas the first movie was a man confronting his childhood demons in his family home, this movie is set in hospital where the main character also attempts to overcome her childhood fears. As well as finding herself in the worst staffed hospital of all time, one of Laura's doctors is none other than Jigsaw himself (the wonderful Tobin Bell, who is as creepy here as in the "Saw" movies). Things aren't looking good for her.\n\nOnce each of her fellow patients has revealed their fears in various non-too-subtle ways ("I'm not changing the light in your closet because I'M SCARED OF THE DARK!" "I'm not shaking your hand because I'M SCARED OF GERMS!" etc), they all begin to be killed by the evil Boogeyman who (surprise...surprise) uses their fears against them. I actually quite liked some of the deaths here which were suitably graphic and disturbing - I'm sure a lot of ketchup must have been used in the making of this movie.\n\nHowever, I ultimately felt deceived by "Boogeyman 2". \n\nThe makers actually trick you in a very naughty way - kinda like going to watch a "Nightmare On Elm Street" sequel only to discover that Freddie is no longer the evil spirit of a child murderer but is now an evil robot from the future. You'd say "Huh? This isn't anything like the first movie. I wanted to see a supernatural horror movie, not another Terminator clone!". You'll see exactly what I mean if you've seen "Boogeyman" and then watch "Boogeyman 2" (unfortunately, I can't be any more specific as it would be a spoiler). In fact, "Boogeyman 2" has so little to do with the first "Boogeyman" that I'm surprised they even share the same name. It also features one completely unnecessary scene of graphic nudity - whether this is a good thing or not depends upon whether you're still in high school. I left high school a while ago and found myself wondering why the scene needed to exist at all. Oh well.\n\nIn summary then, this is a very average little horror movie. I can't say I was particularly scared by any of it but it was nicely acted and had some cool death scenes (some of which reminded me a little bit of "Saw" if truth be told - no wonder Tobin Bell turned up!). \n\nIf you like watching teens running around dark corridors before losing their vital organs (and your DVD collection consists of movies such as "Halloween: Resurrection" and "Jason X"), then it's probably worth a rental. However, if you really enjoyed the first movie and want more of the same (or, like me, you're just looking for a good supernatural horror movie), I'm willing to bet that you'll be disappointed with "Boogeyman 2".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-03-11","keywords":"second part,freaking out,mental health facility,tape over mouth,teen slasher","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Boogeyman 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2545615129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJkMTVmZjQtNWU2MC00YjJjLTlkZTItZjNkMjc1NjhiZmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJkMTVmZjQtNWU2MC00YjJjLTlkZTItZjNkMjc1NjhiZmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1642290/","name":"Danielle Savre"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1959563/","name":"Matt Cohen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2306284/","name":"Chrissy Calhoun"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0079111/","name":"Jeff Betancourt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017834/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0116611/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0797321/","name":"Brian Sieve"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0471392/","name":"Eric Kripke"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Anyway, I plan to continue watching since they really aren't any other good shows on at the moment.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50251,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-07-07","keywords":"occult detective,supernatural power,artifact,steampunk,shared universe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565858/","name":"Eddie McClintock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1162399/","name":"Joanne Kelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007210/","name":"Saul Rubinek"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242101/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0282285/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0260870/","name":"Jane Espenson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609315/","name":"D.

While the storyline is predictable, there is an element of psychological uncertainty that pervades the film.\n\nHow can something not be real if we really believe in it?\n\nWhen a college girl named Sarah witnesses the gruesome murder of her friend, her life gets turned upside down. There is an all pervasive presence of evil manifested in the form of a demonic entity.\n\nOne after another students who begin believing in the Boogeyman legend are discredited, until they start dying and it gets scary as hell right through to the bitter end...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4816,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-01-20","keywords":"playing fetch with a dog,closet,monster under bed,bloody hand,voice over journal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Boogeyman 3: DVD Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi767886105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MzgzNzMwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjUwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MzgzNzMwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjUwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When college sophomore Sarah Morris witnesses the alleged suicide of her best friend, it sets into motion a series of horrific events that cause Sarah to fear the supernatural entity known as the Boogeyman.
