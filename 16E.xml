With the rise of the famous Ming Dynasty in China and the waning days of the Mongols, the Korean emperor was eager to formalize ties with the new Chinese government.  This is the story of one of the those diplomatic missions.\n\nThis is an epic film, shoot over 9000 miles of China's northern region. Covering plains, prairies, forests, deserts and coastline.  The cinematography is beautiful.\n\nThough this is a Korean film, it utilizes the famous Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, who portrays a kidnapped daughter of the Chinese Emperor.\n\nThroughout most of the film the Korean warriors speak Korean.  The Princess and the Chinese villagers speak Mandarin.  Interestingly the Mongols also speak Mandarin to each other, historically inaccurate but Mongols don't go to movies these days. Some of the Koreans can also speak Mandarin. This is accurate since the educated Koreans of the time, could read, write and speak Chinese.  This film is subtitled in English.\n\nThis is a grand story of honor, sacrifice and overcoming overwhelming odds. The Korean warriors must fight the larger forces of the Mongols.

    <desc lang="hr">Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical Treasure: Directed by Mark McLaughlin. With Julie Andrews, Fred Astaire, Obba Babatundé, John Badham. HOLLYWOOD SINGING &amp; DANCING: A MUSICAL TREASURE is a celebration of song and dance, beginning with the Busby Berkeley films that lifted the spirits of audiences during the Great Depression, through the patriotic musicals of the 1940s and ending with the collapse of the studio system in the 1950s. Hosted by Academy Award winning stage, screen and television icon, Shirley Jones, this "docutainment" film is a grand historical look at the magic of musical Hollywood. Highlighted are amazing songs and dance numbers, little-known facts, and luminaries who made the magic possible such as Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Shirley Temple, Betty Grable, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, James Cagney, Vincente Minnelli, Stanley Donen, Frank Sinatra, Leslie Caron, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger. Mesmerizing sequences are interspersed with fresh new commentary by Liza Minnelli, Leslie Caron, Debbie Reynolds, Mickey Rooney, Jane Russell, Rita Moreno, Pat Boone, Rob Marshall, Bill Condon, Shirley MacLaine, Tommy Tune, Joel Grey, Smokey Robinson, Patti Page, Tab Hunter, George Chakiris, Rhonda Fleming, Betty Garrett, Marge Champion, Joan Leslie, Robert Osborne, Stella Stevens, Gloria Stuart and others.

When they arrive, they find they are not as welcome as they thought they would be.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0298148/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"dfranzen70"},"dateCreated":"2004-11-08","inLanguage":"English","name":"More Shrekervescence!","reviewBody":"I know what you're expecting me to say. "If you liked Shrek ..." And it's so true. Fans of the first will be ga-ga over the second. The gang at Dreamworks was smart enough not to monkey around with a winning formula, so you have all the wit and charm of Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and all the fantastic fairy-tale creatures.\n\nAt the beginning of 2, Shrek and Fiona have been invited by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) to the family castle. Imagine their surprise when the honeymooning ogres show up! Seems the king and queen haven't heard that a) Fiona's an ogre and b) that her husband is one, too. Naturally, this doesn't sit particularly well with the king, and soon he's hired a hit man - Puss in Boots, no less, voiced by Antonio Banderas - to bump off his new son in law. Meanwhile, a Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) offers help to Fiona. And quickly, the main question of the film - conveniently, it was the main question of the first film - is whether love conquers all. Oh, perhaps it's a bit more complex than that - perhaps it's whether Fiona would love Shrek, no matter what he looked like. Come to think of it, that was the theme of the first one as well. \n\nShrek and Fiona journey to the land of Far, Far Away, where the stuffy king and the queen mum live. Far, Far Away is a clear knockoff of Hollywood itself (complete with the sign on the mountain), and the journey includes a pass through what looks like Beverly Hills. The attention to detail is marvelous, as always.\n\nAs with 1, 2 drops all sorts of Disney references, most resulting in full-out belly laughter.

"If you liked Shrek ..." And it's so true. Fans of the first will be ga-ga over the second. The gang at Dreamworks was smart enough not to monkey around with a winning formula, so you have all the wit and charm of Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and all the fantastic fairy-tale creatures.\n\nAt the beginning of 2, Shrek and Fiona have been invited by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) to the family castle. Imagine their surprise when the honeymooning ogres show up! Seems the king and queen haven't heard that a) Fiona's an ogre and b) that her husband is one, too. Naturally, this doesn't sit particularly well with the king, and soon he's hired a hit man - Puss in Boots, no less, voiced by Antonio Banderas - to bump off his new son in law. Meanwhile, a Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) offers help to Fiona. And quickly, the main question of the film - conveniently, it was the main question of the first film - is whether love conquers all. Oh, perhaps it's a bit more complex than that - perhaps it's whether Fiona would love Shrek, no matter what he looked like. Come to think of it, that was the theme of the first one as well. \n\nShrek and Fiona journey to the land of Far, Far Away, where the stuffy king and the queen mum live. Far, Far Away is a clear knockoff of Hollywood itself (complete with the sign on the mountain), and the journey includes a pass through what looks like Beverly Hills. The attention to detail is marvelous, as always.\n\nAs with 1, 2 drops all sorts of Disney references, most resulting in full-out belly laughter. I was in stitches, although perhaps - just perhaps - some of the humor will zoom over your tiny tot's tiny head.\n\nShrek 2 is a beautifully done movie, perhaps even more entertaining than the original. Sure, at the end you know your emotions have been manipulated somewhat, but in the end you really don't care.

We could consider the other merits of the movie, but it has none. None at all. It's a SyFy quota quickie, with the usual collection of embarrassingly awful CGI, an utterly nonsensical script made from scraps of coffee stained paper found in community film college trash cans, and a cast harvested from the rejects of daytime soap extra auditions.\n\nSo instead let's just cut to the chase and talk about the Name in this disaster of a disaster movie: Tiffany.\n\nGod damn, SyFy has made some bizarre choices in female leads. The criteria is simple enough: take some washed up has-been like Traci Lords or a desperate wannabe like Felicia Day who will work for cab fare and catering, shove them in front of a camcorder and film whatever they feel like shrieking. But at least with the like of Lords or Day, you probably kinda woulda, maybe. But Tiffany looks like she passed on the cab fare and just ate the catering. And everyone else's.

We could consider the other merits of the movie, but it has none. None at all. It's a SyFy quota quickie, with the usual collection of embarrassingly awful CGI, an utterly nonsensical script made from scraps of coffee stained paper found in community film college trash cans, and a cast harvested from the rejects of daytime soap extra auditions.\n\nSo instead let's just cut to the chase and talk about the Name in this disaster of a disaster movie: Tiffany.\n\nGod damn, SyFy has made some bizarre choices in female leads. The criteria is simple enough: take some washed up has-been like Traci Lords or a desperate wannabe like Felicia Day who will work for cab fare and catering, shove them in front of a camcorder and film whatever they feel like shrieking. But at least with the like of Lords or Day, you probably kinda woulda, maybe. But Tiffany looks like she passed on the cab fare and just ate the catering. And everyone else's. And the caterers.\n\nGranted, you can't complain about the quantity of T&amp;A on screen, but the quality leaves a lot to be desired. She's about 2 supersized lunches away from being comedy fatso material, only without the laughs.\n\nTo be fair, if you're into chubby chasing, Tiffany has quite a soft milfy look to her pudgy face, and if SyFy had squeezed her into a corset and filmed her carefully, they might have made something watchable.

Kevin Costner takes the title role and proves to be handsome enough and swashbuckling enough to do justice to the role during the action scenes. However, during the film's quieter moments, Costner's American accent grates a little amid the Sherwood Forest surroundings.\n\n The story doesn't particularly need explaining, but for people who have lived on Mars for their whole lives here it is. Robin of Locksley, a young soldier, returns from the Crusades to find the city of Nottingham and its surrounding area terrorised by the evil Sherrif of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). Robin takes refuge in the nearby Sherwood Forest, where he gathers a band of woodland outlaws who are always stealing money and treasure taken by the Sherrif and giving it back to the poor. His dashing antics impress Maid Marian (Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio), a childhood friend, and he quickly becomes popular with the poor and honest folk who nickname him Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves.\n\n The film is very old-fashioned, but it occasionally gives away its 1991 release status with modern touches (the fancy camera-work in which the camera is seemingly fixed upon an arrow as it is fired at a target; the introduction of a Moorish warrior character [Morgan Freeman] to broaden the film's cultural reference; Rickman's self-deprecating pantomimic turn as the wicked Sherrif). On the whole, it is an entertaining film with a good balance between the action and the romance. The best performance - surprisingly - comes from Michael Wincott who oozes menace as the Sherrif's despicable cousin Guy of Gisbourne. There are some quite significant factual errors, the best (by "best" I mean "funniest") of which is when Robin and his Moorish companion stand at the foot of the white cliffs of Dover and Robin tells him: "by nightfall we will dine with my father!"

Even though I have liked all four of its principal actors for years, I hadn't planned on seeing it last night or possibly ever. The reviews have been uniformly terrible, so I was expecting the worst. I sat in a movie theater that was perhaps one-third full, and I was waiting for the boredom to set in, which the critics said was comingin spades.\n\nYes, Owen Wilson has bleached-blond locks, again, but that is probably the only accurate comment in any of the reviews that I saw, and I must have read at least ten of them, from various parts of the country. He was very good, as he was in the "Wedding Crashers." Kate Hudson was perky as always, and did a splendid job; and anyone who has loved her mother over the years will find Goldie's "clone" just as lovely as ever.\n\nMatt Dillon did a terrific job, and was totally believable comically; and Michael Douglas was very good too, playing his character with aplomb. In short, it was a very funny movie, and quite refreshing given the alternatives; namely, movies that are loaded to the gills with special effects, which jar one's cranium to the uttermost.\n\nIt seems like the critics were in lock step in panning this film, which may be driving away audiences unfairly. Indeed, this may be a perfect example of the critics being wrong, dead wrong. Go see it in a theater, or buy a DVD when it comes out, and my guess is that you will not be disappointed one iotaand may actually love it. All four principal actors are perfectly balanced, and they are strong enough to be wonderful foils to one another.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80446,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-11-08","keywords":"reference to audrey hepburn,reference to lance armstrong,cycling accident,road cycling,newlywed couple","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"You, Me and Dupree","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2214527257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFiODIwOWUtNDY4Ni00MWI4LTgyNTQtMmRlZDYwYmMwM2NjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFiODIwOWUtNDY4Ni00MWI4LTgyNTQtMmRlZDYwYmMwM2NjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Universal Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005028/","name":"Kate Hudson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000369/","name":"Matt Dillon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751577/","name":"Anthony Russo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751648/","name":"Joe Russo"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239930/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1942829/","name":"Michael LeSieur"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even though I have liked all four of its principal actors for years, I hadn't planned on seeing it last night or possibly ever. The reviews have been uniformly terrible, so I was expecting the worst. I sat in a movie theater that was perhaps one-third full, and I was waiting for the boredom to set in, which the critics said was comingin spades.\n\nYes, Owen Wilson has bleached-blond locks, again, but that is probably the only accurate comment in any of the reviews that I saw, and I must have read at least ten of them, from various parts of the country. He was very good, as he was in the "Wedding Crashers." Kate Hudson was perky as always, and did a splendid job; and anyone who has loved her mother over the years will find Goldie's "clone" just as lovely as ever.\n\nMatt Dillon did a terrific job, and was totally believable comically; and Michael Douglas was very good too, playing his character with aplomb. In short, it was a very funny movie, and quite refreshing given the alternatives; namely, movies that are loaded to the gills with special effects, which jar one's cranium to the uttermost.\n\nIt seems like the critics were in lock step in panning this film, which may be driving away audiences unfairly. Indeed, this may be a perfect example of the critics being wrong, dead wrong. Go see it in a theater, or buy a DVD when it comes out, and my guess is that you will not be disappointed one iotaand may actually love it. All four principal actors are perfectly balanced, and they are strong enough to be wonderful foils to one another.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80446,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-11-08","keywords":"reference to audrey hepburn,reference to lance armstrong,cycling accident,road cycling,newlywed couple","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"You, Me and Dupree","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2214527257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFiODIwOWUtNDY4Ni00MWI4LTgyNTQtMmRlZDYwYmMwM2NjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFiODIwOWUtNDY4Ni00MWI4LTgyNTQtMmRlZDYwYmMwM2NjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Universal Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005028/","name":"Kate Hudson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000369/","name":"Matt Dillon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751577/","name":"Anthony Russo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751648/","name":"Joe Russo"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239930/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1942829/","name":"Michael LeSieur"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As Starling works under the demeaning supervision of Agent Krendler, Lecter begins to taunt her with letters from an unknown location. Meanwhile in Florence, Inspector Pazzi begins to suspect the identity of the new curator, while Verger places a $3million reward for anyone who will bring him information leading to Lecter.\n\nThe sequel that everyone wanted to see and that got lots of headlines for it's gory content was not something I was very bothered about seeing. Although I think Silence was a good film I was a bit surprised by the sheer volume and degree of praise that was heaped upon it. However I decided I would give it a go when it finally came on television and I pretty much got what I expected  a gory film that trades on blood and it's title character without a great deal else of real value put in with it. The story is very condensed from the book (so I'm told anyway) and is basically boiled down to a handful of events that will deliver the shock and gore if that's all you want  but that's not all I wanted. I needed a lot more in fact and I have a better appreciation of what made the first film a much better one than this.\n\nFor one thing the whole film lacks suspense  by which I mean real suspense and tension, not just the suspense as we await the imminent arrive of the next gory scene. The plot is a little bit daffy at points and this may be done to it's slimmed down nature  certainly I was not drawn in so much as merely standing by watching it. The film also asks a lot of us; it asks us to understand the relationship dynamic between Lecter and Starling even though it shows us very little here  almost like it is expecting us just to take it on face value and remember Silence without it carrying anything through. Also it asked us to like, even support, Lecter  an idea that I found wholly unappealing. There is nothing wrong with having a monster as your 'hero' character or of focusing on the dark side of humanity but here the film practically revels in the gore, almost forgetting all else. It has made Lecter such a comical character ('okay-dokay'?) that it doesn't really know what to do with itself when he is off screen. The fact that it doesn't do anything with this dark beast other than stare lovingly at him is a problem for me and just supported the idea that the film was out for gore.\n\nEven the cast seem to realize that this film is nowhere near the caliber of Silence and they all seem to have their tongue in their cheeks with their performances. Hopkins seems to relish the chance to overplay in a big payday for him (the film could happen without Foster but not without him). His character is so much more played for fun than in Silence and this damages the tension, but Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself nonetheless. Moore plays it totally straight and doesn't have much fun  she is good but she doesn't stand out even if she does replace Foster well. An unrecognisable Oldman also hams it up but keeps his character just this side of silly Ivanek supports Oldman well but is obviously eclipsed by the latter's showy role. Giannini is good in his minor role and is lucky to escape the script's excesses; sadly Liotta is not free and his performance towards the end matches the absurdity of the plot in his regard.\n\nOverall this is a big fancy horror movie but it is far from the standard of Silence. It lacks real bite (sorry) in terms of tension and excitement and it replaces it with a series of increasingly gory set pieces. If all you want is superficial delivery then this is worth seeing as it is enjoyable as a gory horror but it is no more than that and fans of the mood and atmosphere of Silence Of The Lambs will feel a little cheated."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-03-14","keywords":"hannibal lecter,police,cannibal,pistol,villain played by lead actor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hannibal","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1300339481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM/UA"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365383/","name":"Thomas Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000519/","name":"David Mamet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001873/","name":"Steven Zaillian"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Finally a huge ovation for Eugene Levy, who gets major laughs as the Jim's dad.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":393114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1999-07-09","keywords":"female masturbation,prom,sex comedy,female nudity,bare breasts","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"American Pie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1622540569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA4MjI3MjItOGIxNy00MzcxLWJiNWQtZWQ4MzA5ZGIyYTk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA4MjI3MjItOGIxNy00MzcxLWJiNWQtZWQ4MzA5ZGIyYTk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004755/","name":"Jason Biggs","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005098/","name":"Chris Klein","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005272/","name":"Thomas Ian Nicholas"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919369/","name":"Paul Weitz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919363/","name":"Chris Weitz"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0100462/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0082027/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381221/","name":"Adam Herz"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If they avoided it, then the climatic fight might have been longer and a bit more, you know, climatic.

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-03-08","keywords":"playing a board game,sibling rivalry,board game,two brothers,outer space","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Zathura","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1608712473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MmYyZTAtZGVkNC00NWQzLWE4OGEtNmNmNGM0OWY1ZDNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MmYyZTAtZGVkNC00NWQzLWE4OGEtNmNmNGM0OWY1ZDNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1242688/","name":"Josh Hutcherson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1501050/","name":"Jonah Bobo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1009277/","name":"Dax Shepard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0269463/","name":"Jon Favreau"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060719/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0885575/","name":"Chris Van Allsburg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436960/","name":"John Kamps"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players.

WRONG! the disastrous Live-Action Smurfs film that had high celebrity voices, Irrelevany Product Placement, and cameos that didn't help the story at all. the film and fell flat with barely making back its budget that left adults childhoods ruined. Later in 2013 was the just as bad sequel to The Smurfs that failed more than the first with the same premise of cameos, unnecessary characters and product placement, and was downright awful spawning the films to roll in peyo's grave. Later in 2017 is a fresh breath of air from the terrible Smurfs movies that Sony made, despite this new being made by Sony. Smurfs The Lost Village is Directed by Kelly Asbury, the same director behind Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, Gnomeo and Juliet, and Spirit. The Movie's plot has best friends Smurfette (Demi Lovato), Brainy (Danny Pudi), Clumsy (Jack McBrayer) and Hefty (Joe Manganiello) use a map that guides them through the Forbidden Forest and wonderland that's filled with magical creatures. Their adventure leads them on a course to discover the biggest secret in Smurf history as they race against time and the evil wizard Gargamel (Rainn Wilson) to find a mysterious village. The plot is your basic Lord of the Rings like quest where the characters are forced to handle environments and new creature that would either friend or eat them. It is a reused basic scheme that Hollywood uses, but it's the execution to the specific details of what matters. The Characters are mostly reminiscent to the creator, Peyo's vision, and maybe some changes that either compel or drag the story either feeling annoying or acceptable. I feel that most of the background Smurfs would have been more reliable and interesting rather than the main smurfs. While the acting is great with the voices not being original and rather that happy-go-lucky charm you either find endearing or redundant. The animation I will say is great though, and seeing the smurfs having more of a look to the comics did feel charming with how the other two, felt...creepy. This movie has it's feel of the Trolls film from 2016 in which they kinda stole their expedition with revealing them in a musical standard. Despite the similar impact, the movie does feel better with the movie barely spewing pop culture references and worthless innuendos. Overall, The Smurfs lost village is good movie despite the childlike humor in most scenes while giving a more character impact whether if you found the useful or useless to the plot. The Plot is executed well in which i give credit for being better than the CGI smurfs movies. This movie can be better for some demographics specifically for younger audiences while boring adults or older teens. The movie is what i call enjoyable for a Point of View whether if you are a child with a pov for thrill seeing characters going on an adventure facing many adversity and discovering a new life. You can pay respect respect for this film considering it has a lower budget than the other terrible Smurfs movies of 60 million with the others being over 100 million, that is bull.

WRONG! the disastrous Live-Action Smurfs film that had high celebrity voices, Irrelevany Product Placement, and cameos that didn't help the story at all. the film and fell flat with barely making back its budget that left adults childhoods ruined. Later in 2013 was the just as bad sequel to The Smurfs that failed more than the first with the same premise of cameos, unnecessary characters and product placement, and was downright awful spawning the films to roll in peyo's grave. Later in 2017 is a fresh breath of air from the terrible Smurfs movies that Sony made, despite this new being made by Sony. Smurfs The Lost Village is Directed by Kelly Asbury, the same director behind Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, Gnomeo and Juliet, and Spirit. The Movie's plot has best friends Smurfette (Demi Lovato), Brainy (Danny Pudi), Clumsy (Jack McBrayer) and Hefty (Joe Manganiello) use a map that guides them through the Forbidden Forest and wonderland that's filled with magical creatures. Their adventure leads them on a course to discover the biggest secret in Smurf history as they race against time and the evil wizard Gargamel (Rainn Wilson) to find a mysterious village. The plot is your basic Lord of the Rings like quest where the characters are forced to handle environments and new creature that would either friend or eat them. It is a reused basic scheme that Hollywood uses, but it's the execution to the specific details of what matters. The Characters are mostly reminiscent to the creator, Peyo's vision, and maybe some changes that either compel or drag the story either feeling annoying or acceptable. I feel that most of the background Smurfs would have been more reliable and interesting rather than the main smurfs. While the acting is great with the voices not being original and rather that happy-go-lucky charm you either find endearing or redundant. The animation I will say is great though, and seeing the smurfs having more of a look to the comics did feel charming with how the other two, felt...creepy. This movie has it's feel of the Trolls film from 2016 in which they kinda stole their expedition with revealing them in a musical standard. Despite the similar impact, the movie does feel better with the movie barely spewing pop culture references and worthless innuendos. Overall, The Smurfs lost village is good movie despite the childlike humor in most scenes while giving a more character impact whether if you found the useful or useless to the plot. The Plot is executed well in which i give credit for being better than the CGI smurfs movies. This movie can be better for some demographics specifically for younger audiences while boring adults or older teens. The movie is what i call enjoyable for a Point of View whether if you are a child with a pov for thrill seeing characters going on an adventure facing many adversity and discovering a new life. You can pay respect respect for this film considering it has a lower budget than the other terrible Smurfs movies of 60 million with the others being over 100 million, that is bull. I thought the movie was good despite some concerns in the characters not being that reminiscent from Peyo's original vision. If your child or little brother wants a smile on his face, let him watch this movie, and it is a better excuse to just enjoy it better than the previous trash films.

On his first day, suddenly K and J are on a mission to stop a massive cockroach from destroying Earth and starting a galactic war. \n\nThe chemistry between Smith and Jones is hilarious. Smith has some great comedy scenes especially when he is using his new weapon, the Noisy Crickett and him trying to deliver a baby squid type creature. The aliens are smart, their inventive, and their just plain fun when seeing how they identify themselves and hide their identities. The story is funny and will keep you laughing at almost every scene.\n\nThe presentation of aliens as everyday people trying to live normal lives in Manhattan is a lot more fun than the presentation of murderous aliens (Independence Day). Another great part is that the film isn't overblown with special effects of alien explosions and massive battles. Instead comedy and chemistry keeps this top comedy flowing. \n\nMen In Black.

I gave this movie a six, but I felt like being generous (I probably should give it a five).  This movie is short.  I mean really, really short.  There is a short that preceded the movie so that tells you how short this movie is (the short got more laughs than the movie I think).  I went to this movie knowing how short it was, but it just went by so fast and the movie was a bit unmemorable that it was a waste of time to drive to the theater.  There was no time for character development or much story development.  In fact, the opening credit scene itself took four or five minutes.  The story has Smith's character trying to get the memory back of Jones character to battle an alien threat.  For the most part there isn't much that is funny in this one, but there are a few scenes to make a person chuckle.  Then there is the pug dog.  I think it had the same screen time as Tommy Lee Jones.  It was funny in small doses, but its role was expanded way too much for the sequel. Johnny Knoxville's character was lame as was the main villain, which had looks but no funny dialogue at all.  Tony Shaloub is back, and once again his character's role is small and underused.  So all in all this is an inferior sequel by all means with just enough to look at to keep you from getting bored.  If they ever make a part three, please let them get a director who is capable of making a movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":360073,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-07-24","keywords":"lingerie,michael jackson character,calzone,video conference,leather outfit","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1097638425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NDUzMDg5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0OTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NDUzMDg5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0OTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Agent J needs help so he is sent to find Agent K and restore his memory"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001800/","name":"Rip Torn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001756/","name":"Barry Sonnenfeld"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108321/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192384/","name":"Lowell Cunningham"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330565/","name":"Robert Gordon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266673/","name":"Barry Fanaro"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I gave this movie a six, but I felt like being generous (I probably should give it a five).  This movie is short.  I mean really, really short.  There is a short that preceded the movie so that tells you how short this movie is (the short got more laughs than the movie I think).  I went to this movie knowing how short it was, but it just went by so fast and the movie was a bit unmemorable that it was a waste of time to drive to the theater.  There was no time for character development or much story development.  In fact, the opening credit scene itself took four or five minutes.  The story has Smith's character trying to get the memory back of Jones character to battle an alien threat.  For the most part there isn't much that is funny in this one, but there are a few scenes to make a person chuckle.  Then there is the pug dog.  I think it had the same screen time as Tommy Lee Jones.  It was funny in small doses, but its role was expanded way too much for the sequel. Johnny Knoxville's character was lame as was the main villain, which had looks but no funny dialogue at all.  Tony Shaloub is back, and once again his character's role is small and underused.  So all in all this is an inferior sequel by all means with just enough to look at to keep you from getting bored.  If they ever make a part three, please let them get a director who is capable of making a movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":360073,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-07-24","keywords":"lingerie,michael jackson character,calzone,video conference,leather outfit","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1097638425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NDUzMDg5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0OTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NDUzMDg5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0OTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Agent J needs help so he is sent to find Agent K and restore his memory","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001800/","name":"Rip Torn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001756/","name":"Barry Sonnenfeld"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108321/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192384/","name":"Lowell Cunningham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330565/","name":"Robert Gordon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266673/","name":"Barry Fanaro"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018. \n\n No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting. \n\n Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. "Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much.\n\n Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.   Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch).\n\n Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car "why can't you just drive us where we need to go?" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is.\n\n Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with "I'm just saying you're a babe." Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short.\n\n These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":352586,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-12-20","keywords":"jungle,trapped in a game,title based on song,song in title,high school","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3413817625","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four teenagers discover an old video game console and are literally drawn into the game's jungle setting becoming the adult avatars they choose."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2394794/","name":"Karen Gillan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366389/","name":"Kevin Hart"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440458/","name":"Jake Kasdan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332017/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003298/","name":"Scott Rosenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If there's some property damage done while catching criminals, people will be angry; if a vigilante has a bad attitude, people will be angry. I suppose Batman explores some of that not being liked by the public, as well as the bad attitude and personal trauma of the hero, but I found Hancock to be quite original in its handling of these issues. I liked the media attention and the use of sunglasses as a "mask" of sorts. I really liked how Hancock progresses as a character, and I liked the other characters as well. Usually little kids in movies annoy me, but the son of the supporting character was pretty cute and endearing. This isn't really a hero movie where there is a superhero and a super villain; I think it's more about what it means to be a human and relate to other people, to do good things and the desire to be accepted.

This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018. \n\n No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting. \n\n Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. "Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much.\n\n Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.   Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch).\n\n Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car "why can't you just drive us where we need to go?" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is.\n\n Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with "I'm just saying you're a babe." Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short.\n\n These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":352586,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-12-20","keywords":"jungle,trapped in a game,title based on song,song in title,high school","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3413817625","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four teenagers discover an old video game console and are literally drawn into the game's jungle setting becoming the adult avatars they choose."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2394794/","name":"Karen Gillan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366389/","name":"Kevin Hart"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440458/","name":"Jake Kasdan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332017/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003298/","name":"Scott Rosenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'm beyond fed up with shows parading hardcore feminists while watering down the strength of men. This show displays the strength of both. Men are physically stronger than women. Women seem to be smarter than men. That's okay by me. Here you don't see 110 pound women beating up scores of 200 pound, well trained fighters, which is ludicrous every time I see that nonsense (with the exception of vampires). Here, women are fighting like warriors to hold the family together and are also providing the intel (brains) for the testosterone packing heterosexual males. They compliment each other versus compete, as it should be. If there is a noise in the house, unlike the woke crowd, I won't tell my wife it's her turn to check it out. I won't ask her to flip a coin to see who should stand between an assailant and the spouse.\n\nThe woke war on masculine heterosexual males has not impacted this show (so far in season 1).

The teenager Courtney (Anne Winters) sees that she has just a couple of hours to live and does not accept the ride of her drunken boyfriend Evan (Dillon Lane). She walks home but she is killed by a supernatural creature when the timer in her cellphone reaches zero. Meanwhile Evan crashes his car at the same time of her death and he goes to a hospital where the nurse Quinn Harris (Elizabeth Lail) works. Evan discloses that he is afraid to go into surgery since the app Countdown predicts that he will die at the same time of the surgery. The doctors and nurses of the hospital decide to download the app and Quinn learns that she has only three days of life. When Evan mysterious dies in an accident at the hospital, Quinn buys a new cellphone and finds that the app is also installed. When she meets Matt Monroe (Jordan Calloway) at the parking lot of the store, she learns that his death is predicted for a couple of hours before her and they team-up to look for a means to break the curse.\n\n"Countdown" is an entertaining horror film for fans of "Final Destination". The plot and the acting are not bad and Quinn Harris is a pleasant character.

The teenager Courtney (Anne Winters) sees that she has just a couple of hours to live and does not accept the ride of her drunken boyfriend Evan (Dillon Lane). She walks home but she is killed by a supernatural creature when the timer in her cellphone reaches zero. Meanwhile Evan crashes his car at the same time of her death and he goes to a hospital where the nurse Quinn Harris (Elizabeth Lail) works. Evan discloses that he is afraid to go into surgery since the app Countdown predicts that he will die at the same time of the surgery. The doctors and nurses of the hospital decide to download the app and Quinn learns that she has only three days of life. When Evan mysterious dies in an accident at the hospital, Quinn buys a new cellphone and finds that the app is also installed. When she meets Matt Monroe (Jordan Calloway) at the parking lot of the store, she learns that his death is predicted for a couple of hours before her and they team-up to look for a means to break the curse.\n\n"Countdown" is an entertaining horror film for fans of "Final Destination". The plot and the acting are not bad and Quinn Harris is a pleasant character. There are silly and unnecessary subplots, like the harassment of Dr. Sullivan, the priest that likes to joke or the romance of Quinn and Matt, but in general the movie is worthwhile watching.

Not because of the topic as this was already highlighted in "The Monuments Men", but because of the brilliant rendition Helen Mirren is showing here. A role that suits her perfectly. A distinguished elderly lady who's a descendant of a wealthy Jewish family and who was forced to flee to the United States during Austria's annexation with Germany. She left behind everything: family, personal things and valuable belongings that were owned by the family Altmann. The resentment towards the German ruler obviously is still as lively now as it was in the past.

The first part, and least successful, is about the court case Maria Altmann starts against the Austrian state, who consider the previous mentioned painting as a national treasure. The fact that it was stolen by the Nazis and actually ended up in their hands unlawfully, was a side issue apparently. So the first thing we are presented with, is an old fashioned courtroom drama with Ryan Reynolds as the young lawyer Randol Schönberg, grandson of the famous Austrian composer Arnold Schönberg and also descendant of a family of war refugees.\n\nThe fascinating and interesting part of the film focuses on the past and present of the widow Altmann. A metered mixture of images of this zestful character these days and the painful memories weighing on her shoulders. These memories are displayed in old-fashioned-looking sepia-colored flashbacks. A sketch full of contrasts of the still traumatized Maria and the conditions in which she lived during the occupation. The humiliations and fear. When she gets back in Vienna after so many years, Mary's facial expression proves that this past still weighs heavily on her.\n\nHelen Mirren is a kind of mixture of P. L. Travers and Queen Elizabeth. A lady behaving according to the etiquette from the upper middle class who keeps certain values and norms still alive. A stiff Victorian granny who suffers from a trauma and is seeking for justice. A kind of Miss Marple, but then still in possession of an elegant well-preserved beauty. Without any effort Mirren surpasses the young Reynold on screen. Despite his immense importance in the complex legal procedure, the character pales in comparison with the engaging, witty and sometimes tragic person performed by Mirren. Despite the fact that now and then she brings forward corny sounding quotes, she remains a credible and worthy character.\n\nOf course you can cite that the Austrian people are portrayed in a one-sided and caricatural way and look like an anti-Semitic nation that supports the Nazi-regime. Personally, I'm convinced that it's pretty close to being true and that it's more an instinctual survival tactic than that they were supporting that ideology. But that's another discussion. Maybe the relationship between Maria Altmann and her aunt Adèle could have been worked out a bit deeper. But the acting of Mirren and the tragic images of the past create an unparalleled film filled with tragedy and justice. \n\nMore reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":56892,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-04-10","keywords":"justice,austrian history,holocaust,art museum,looting","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi278572569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjQ4MzMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMzNDUxNDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjQ4MzMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMzNDUxNDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Sixty years after she fled Vienna during World War II, an elderly Jewish woman, Maria Altmann, starts her journey to retrieve family possessions seized by the Nazis, among them Klimt's famous painting 'The Lady in Gold'.

Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) also stars and sends Marshall into a male power trip when she is offered a job position that he was trying so hard to get. Marshall is known for his ability to seduce women and fornicate with them. Most of the women in his life think that he is a self centered jerk, because of the way he objectifies them. Even his fifteen year old daughter feels as if they are not related because of his poor communication skills with women. But an unexpected twist took place one day while blow drying mousse in his hair. While he was going about his business, Marshall tripped, and fell into his bathtub full of water, being electrocuted severely. Oddly enough, what would kill a normal human being did not harm Nick in any way, rather than it mysteriously gave him the power to hear what women are thinking. So, equipped with his new skill, he goes about his day, not knowing he has this amazing ability. Throughout his random encounters with women, particularly at work, he comes to realize that all the women are not very fond of him.\n\nIn all movies, there is always a message of some sort that the director is trying to express. In this particular film, I believe there is more than one message. One of the dilemmas the movie expressed was women do not know what they want. Throughout the movie, women were constantly complaining about men, or their hair, or their outfit. The truth is that women do not know what they do want; only what they don't want. Another message it displayed is a world renown problem: the concept that men do not have a clue about women. They communicate differently as men, and want different things as well. Is reading women's minds the only way for men to understand? I sure hope not.\n\nThe technique of this movie is nothing to throw a fit over. The average cinematography isn't dazzling, but it is good enough to keep the viewer interested. The sound track was well thought out, with many famous songs helping out in several scenes and strongly assisting in setting the mood. A few things stand out in the movie that question reality. For example, Gibson falls into a full bathtub, gets electrocuted by thousands of volts, and only wakes up with a headache. At a different point in the movie he gets shocked again, but not by a household utensil. The second time it's by lightning, and again, just a headache. No singed eyebrows or fried shoelaces were to be found.\n\nWhat Women Want is an entertaining movie at the least. Mel Gibson, as always, does an excellent job portraying his character, as well as Helen Hunt. The cast did a well-rounded job, and no one was out of place. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and enjoyed the humor. The film was filled with talented acting, laughs, and lighthearted suspense. It would be a good recommendation for anyone who is bored and desires a humorous, fun movie. The idea of a man being able to read women's minds is clever and amusing.

So I went to the theater to play movie roulette. Hot Tub Time Machine was playing almost immediately, and the next movie after that wouldn't be for another 45 minutes. I *almost* turned around and went home, so sure was I that this film was going to be stupid rather than funny. But I figured, what the heck, I'm here...\n\nWell, the movie *is* stupid. But it's funny too. And what's more, it knows it's stupid and makes no bones about it. At no time does it ever take itself seriously. Now, I could have done without some of the extremely gross bits. Happily there aren't *too* many of them. And I'm sure I didn't get all the 80's references; although I did live through the period, I largely avoided popular culture at that time, and still couldn't tell you most of the bands or big hit songs of the time (or of today, for that matter).\n\nBut I have to confess, the movie did make me laugh. Not all throughout, but I did have a number of genuine, laugh-out-loud moments. And plenty of chuckles and smiles. And I found myself genuinely liking the characters, and finding them to have a bit more depth than I expected from a film entitled "Hot Tub Time Machine". And the basic theme of the loss of the zany, free-form fun of youth, and regret of the relative staid blandness of "adult" life, is a theme which resonated with me.\n\nNow, let's get real. This is no "Citizen Cane", "Vertigo", or "The Godfather". Nor is a timeless comedy masterpiece like "Airplane", "Blazing Saddles", or "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". Someone here displayed gross unfairness in trying to compare it to a classic '30's comedy, but obviously this is not "It Happened One Night", "Bringing Up Baby", or "Duck Soup", and if you go to the theater expecting it to be, the fault lies with you. What it is is a silly, fun, enjoyable way to pass a couple hours. Not deep, not profound, not brilliant. Not timeless, not enduring.\n\nBut not bad.

She clearly had a massive influence in their characters but in Legend, those pieces of the puzzle are unfortunately missing. But, Tom Hardy compensates for any flaws. He is extraordinary, twice. The twins are total individuals, totally two people. What they carry in common is a sort of sexual danger, one explicitly the other implicitly but both as powerful. They dare us to get close.

The dictator is competently played by Ed Harris.\n\nThe movie is quite long (a little over 2 hours) and does not hurry itself as most blockbuster thrillers would do.

It's interesting to see actors give a shot at directing, writing or even both and for a first feature, Hill doesn't disappoint.\n\nMid90s follows Stevie, a young kid with a troubled family life, and finds a group of friends at a skate shop during the... mid 90s obviously.\n\nIf there is one thing that's executed extremely well, then it's the authentic feeling of the 90s when you watch it. The film has 4:3 aspect ratio and revolves around skateboarding, teenagers, drugs and many more aspects which attribute to the 90s feeling. This film is clearly very personal to Jonah Hill because of how realistic it looks. I really liked the music choices since it amplified the 90s atmosphere even more. It's blatantly targeted towards people from that time period and I'm sure that group of people will find this movie extremely nostalgic. Hill's script is very enjoyable and quite humourous at times. The characters were really fun to watch and what made them believable were the performances by the actors.\n\nSunny Suljic did an incredible job especially as a child performer. He had a lot of range in his acting and played the role to the best of his ability. Na-kel Smith, Olan Prenatt, Gio Galicia and Ryder McLaughlin all gave terrific performances especially considering that fact that all of them haven't acted much before this. Even Lucas Hedges did well as I thought he suited the role.\n\nWhilst watching the movie, it reminded me a lot of Larry Clark's KIDS and I'm sure that film was a huge inspiration to Jonah Hill but it kind of made Mid90s lose some of its originality. Also towards the end, the editing became messy. There was a scene that included somewhat of a jumpscare that I didn't like at all.\n\nMid90s is nowhere near flawless but I respect the amount of work Jonah Hill put into his directorial debut. It's a fun, nostalgic and personal trip coming from someone who's lived through that time and wants to share his love for that period to everyone.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":58080,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-10-26","keywords":"coming of age,skateboard,friendship,alcohol,party","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3602299417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYwMDZkOGQtOWE3Zi00NDE4LTkzOWItNWE1M2E4YWQwMzkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWJhbGl2ZQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYwMDZkOGQtOWE3Zi00NDE4LTkzOWItNWE1M2E4YWQwMzkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWJhbGl2ZQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Stevie, a thirteen-year-old in 90s-era LA, spends his summer navigating between his troubled home life and a group of new friends that he meets at a Motor Avenue skate shop."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6129779/","name":"Sunny Suljic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2239702/","name":"Katherine Waterston"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2348627/","name":"Lucas Hedges"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706767/","name":"Jonah Hill"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390816/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093463/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0353060/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706767/","name":"Jonah Hill"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There was a scene that included somewhat of a jumpscare that I didn't like at all.\n\nMid90s is nowhere near flawless but I respect the amount of work Jonah Hill put into his directorial debut. It's a fun, nostalgic and personal trip coming from someone who's lived through that time and wants to share his love for that period to everyone.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":58080,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-10-26","keywords":"coming of age,skateboard,friendship,alcohol,party","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3602299417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYwMDZkOGQtOWE3Zi00NDE4LTkzOWItNWE1M2E4YWQwMzkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWJhbGl2ZQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYwMDZkOGQtOWE3Zi00NDE4LTkzOWItNWE1M2E4YWQwMzkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWJhbGl2ZQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Stevie, a thirteen-year-old in 90s-era LA, spends his summer navigating between his troubled home life and a group of new friends that he meets at a Motor Avenue skate shop.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6129779/","name":"Sunny Suljic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2239702/","name":"Katherine Waterston","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2348627/","name":"Lucas Hedges"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706767/","name":"Jonah Hill"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390816/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093463/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0353060/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706767/","name":"Jonah Hill"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) also stars and sends Marshall into a male power trip when she is offered a job position that he was trying so hard to get. Marshall is known for his ability to seduce women and fornicate with them. Most of the women in his life think that he is a self centered jerk, because of the way he objectifies them. Even his fifteen year old daughter feels as if they are not related because of his poor communication skills with women. But an unexpected twist took place one day while blow drying mousse in his hair. While he was going about his business, Marshall tripped, and fell into his bathtub full of water, being electrocuted severely. Oddly enough, what would kill a normal human being did not harm Nick in any way, rather than it mysteriously gave him the power to hear what women are thinking. So, equipped with his new skill, he goes about his day, not knowing he has this amazing ability. Throughout his random encounters with women, particularly at work, he comes to realize that all the women are not very fond of him.\n\nIn all movies, there is always a message of some sort that the director is trying to express. In this particular film, I believe there is more than one message. One of the dilemmas the movie expressed was women do not know what they want. Throughout the movie, women were constantly complaining about men, or their hair, or their outfit. The truth is that women do not know what they do want; only what they don't want. Another message it displayed is a world renown problem: the concept that men do not have a clue about women. They communicate differently as men, and want different things as well. Is reading women's minds the only way for men to understand? I sure hope not.\n\nThe technique of this movie is nothing to throw a fit over. The average cinematography isn't dazzling, but it is good enough to keep the viewer interested. The sound track was well thought out, with many famous songs helping out in several scenes and strongly assisting in setting the mood. A few things stand out in the movie that question reality. For example, Gibson falls into a full bathtub, gets electrocuted by thousands of volts, and only wakes up with a headache. At a different point in the movie he gets shocked again, but not by a household utensil. The second time it's by lightning, and again, just a headache. No singed eyebrows or fried shoelaces were to be found.\n\nWhat Women Want is an entertaining movie at the least. Mel Gibson, as always, does an excellent job portraying his character, as well as Helen Hunt. The cast did a well-rounded job, and no one was out of place. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and enjoyed the humor. The film was filled with talented acting, laughs, and lighthearted suspense. It would be a good recommendation for anyone who is bored and desires a humorous, fun movie. The idea of a man being able to read women's minds is clever and amusing.

Should this ever happen, would it be classified as a gift, or a nightmare?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":202270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-04-25","keywords":"advertising,telepathy,bare foot woman,f rated,pantyhose","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000154/","name":"Mel Gibson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000166/","name":"Helen Hunt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000673/","name":"Marisa Tomei"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0583600/","name":"Nancy Meyers"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000700/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028602/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326092/","name":"Josh Goldsmith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0951135/","name":"Cathy Yuspa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0236884/","name":"Diane Drake"],"duration":"PT2H7M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's the wrong genre, (although this movie is difficult to place) the wrong story and it creates the wrong type of atmosphere. Leave this to the women and go and see something a little more.......you. How wrong I was and how glad I am to have jumped out of my comfort zone. It was a good excuse to take my good old mum and treat her to a midday-midweek viewing and some company with her first born or that is what I told myself when I entered the theatre only to find it filled with women and retirees excited to be out and about without the frightening hording masses that congregate on weekends.\n\n'The Dressmaker' has been dubbed as the long awaited return of Director Jocelyn Moorhouse to the chair since 1997 and she has delivered a film that will be remembered for some outstanding performances from Judy Davis, Hugo Weaving and Kate Winslet. I agree with the statement that this film doesn't fit into any particular mold but this peculiar inconsistency is what keeps the audience fixated on the screen. Just when you think that the story is heading down a certain path it quickly turns sideways, takes a detour before arriving at its intended destination. Some viewers may find this lack of direction annoying and even film destroying but I think this could be a little over dramatic.\n\n'The Dressmaker' holds a certain charm that never leaves it as it sways back and forth from one type of genre to the next. It can be billed as a 'black comedy' but it does allow the audience to experience an array of emotions. At times you will be laughing at the antics on screen and at other times you will be gripped by the drama unfolding.\n\nBased on the novel of the same name by Rosalie Ham, 'The Dressmaker' centres around Myrtle 'Tilly' Dunnage (Kate Winslet) and her chaotic return to a small Australian country town in rural Victoria in 1951. Tilly's tumultuous departure years before were under controversial circumstances and the small rural community have not forgotten. She is everything the town isn't - sophisticated, stylish, experienced and worldly and she has come back for one reason......to reek havoc on those that callously betrayed her all those years ago.\n\nKate Winslet rarely puts in a bad showing and her turn as Tilly Dunnage is made even more exceptional with a flawless Australian accent. The audience will forget that she is English as she seamlessly slides into the fabric of her surroundings, not once slipping up when delivering her dialogue. Judy Davis is the star of the show as Tilly's mad mother, Molly Dunnage. Davis effortlessly steals every scene she is in with outstanding engagement with a character that is a little bit off centre. Judy will be recognised for this performance with an AACTA and it will be thoroughly deserved.\n\nHugo Weaving adds his superb presence as the cross dressing cop, Sergeant Farrat. His character grows on the audience with eccentric colourful manner, bringing the best out in Weaving that gives this wonderful film an extra element of charm. Liam Hemsworth provides the eye candy for the ladies in a solid role as Teddy McSwiney. Both Davis and Winslet are caught hot under the collar on numerous occasions. He is the stereo-typical tall, blue-eyed, rugged country boy who is the proverbial apple in his mother's eye and does exactly what Moorhouse hired him to do......stand there and look pretty. Good onya Liam.\n\nJoining the familiar talent is a who's who of Australian television that many international audiences won't recognise but they do give the film a more authentic Aussie flavour. Could this be the breakout role for Sarah Snook? Her character Gertrude Pratt is totally transformed by Tilly Dunnage only to treat the outsider with disdain when 'theories' are whispered throughout the town.\n\nI cannot see any reason why this film won't be enjoyed by the masses. It is Australian and its dry wit may not appeal to foreign markets which is a shame. The narrative is all over the place but don't let this put you off. Dig a little deeper and you will be rewarded with some brilliant performances.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":58494,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-29","keywords":"f rated,australia,costume designer,haute couture,femme fatale","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Dressmaker trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2284565273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNjU0NTAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1NjU3NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNjU0NTAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1NjU3NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Dressmaker trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001114/","name":"Judy Davis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2955013/","name":"Liam Hemsworth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0602104/","name":"Jocelyn Moorhouse"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234956/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0481969/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0263798/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5672426/","name":"Rosalie Ham"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0602104/","name":"Jocelyn Moorhouse"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0389591/","name":"P.J.

Cattaneo's film focuses on the kinship shared between these women, each of whom have their own burdens to bear in the face of such uncertain adversity. Much of the films strength comes from the sincerity of the performances, particularly leads Kristin Scott Thomas and Sharon Horgan, who clash repeatedly throughout the film. Tunnard and Flynn's screenplay strikes a perfect balance in tone, too. It accomplishes a combination of both humour and tragedy (which is perhaps one of the most difficult dichotomies to nail in screenwriting) in a way that never feels superficial, and although it is clear to see the echoes of where it is all going to go, it's difficult not to become invested in the journey. Military Wives is a heartfelt film that is both uplifting and emotional, with standout performances and a truly brilliant final song that brings the whole piece together wonderfully.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4560,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2020-03-06","keywords":"friendship,singing,bus,drinking,bar","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4201561881","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTRkODczMzQtNDJjZS00ZjU0LTk3NTctZDMwNmM2MzViMTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTRkODczMzQtNDJjZS00ZjU0LTk3NTctZDMwNmM2MzViMTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000218/","name":"Kristin Scott Thomas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1279721/","name":"Sharon Horgan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1266378/","name":"Emma Lowndes"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0146341/","name":"Peter Cattaneo"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0407896/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209925/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0784476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2074041/","name":"Rachel Tunnard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1598473/","name":"Rosanne Flynn"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

We've seen many great acting talents wasted on poor screenplays and directing, which we hope not to see in the likes of Tom Hardy.\n\nHis only Oscar nomination was while working with a great director in Alejandro Iñárritu, but that was only it. If he takes the Leonardo DiCaprio route and only work with great directors (e.g. Scorsese, Tarantino, Nolan, Spielberg and Cameron), we would most definitely see the best in him, and him getting the appreciation he deserves.\n\nWe don't know what was intended with this movie, but whatever they had planned, Hardy did just enough to make it work. It may seem as an unconventional parodying performance, or just absolute madness-portraying.\n\nIf you appreciate great acting, watch this movie. Otherwise, you might want to look out for better plot experiences.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19370,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-05-12","keywords":"gangster,one word title,diaper,adult diaper,feces","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1375387161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYzODBlZjQtMDIyNy00ZjkwLWFhM2QtYTAyMzM0OTc1YzJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYzODBlZjQtMDIyNy00ZjkwLWFhM2QtYTAyMzM0OTc1YzJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"The 47-year old Al Capone, after 10 years in prison, starts suffering from dementia and comes to be haunted by his violent past."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362766/","name":"Tom Hardy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004802/","name":"Linda Cardellini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000369/","name":"Matt Dillon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2503633/","name":"Josh Trank"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0309252/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019267/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0563088/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2503633/","name":"Josh Trank"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

We've seen many great acting talents wasted on poor screenplays and directing, which we hope not to see in the likes of Tom Hardy.\n\nHis only Oscar nomination was while working with a great director in Alejandro Iñárritu, but that was only it. If he takes the Leonardo DiCaprio route and only work with great directors (e.g. Scorsese, Tarantino, Nolan, Spielberg and Cameron), we would most definitely see the best in him, and him getting the appreciation he deserves.\n\nWe don't know what was intended with this movie, but whatever they had planned, Hardy did just enough to make it work. It may seem as an unconventional parodying performance, or just absolute madness-portraying.\n\nIf you appreciate great acting, watch this movie. Otherwise, you might want to look out for better plot experiences.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19370,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-05-12","keywords":"gangster,one word title,diaper,adult diaper,feces","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1375387161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYzODBlZjQtMDIyNy00ZjkwLWFhM2QtYTAyMzM0OTc1YzJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYzODBlZjQtMDIyNy00ZjkwLWFhM2QtYTAyMzM0OTc1YzJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"The 47-year old Al Capone, after 10 years in prison, starts suffering from dementia and comes to be haunted by his violent past.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362766/","name":"Tom Hardy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004802/","name":"Linda Cardellini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000369/","name":"Matt Dillon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2503633/","name":"Josh Trank"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0309252/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019267/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0563088/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2503633/","name":"Josh Trank"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Hemsworths presentation of James Hunt is uncanny it's like a documentary he's almost as good as Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln.\n\nIf your not a F1 fan or from the 70's it may not be more than a blokes film, but give it a go it is going to end up being a important as Apollo 13 in the life of Mr Howard and quite frankly is by far the best car racing movie ever","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":459024,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-09-13","keywords":"formula 1,rivalry,1970s,racecar driver,nurburgring germany","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1998301465","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNzA0MzkyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQxNjAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNzA0MzkyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQxNjAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"From Ron Howard comes an exhilarating true story of two legendary rivals James Hunt and Niki Lauda, starring Chris Hemsworth.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0117709/","name":"Daniel Brühl","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1165110/","name":"Chris Hemsworth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1312575/","name":"Olivia Wilde"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000165/","name":"Ron Howard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234935/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0285648/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0604948/","name":"Peter Morgan"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The beautiful face of the American nature and the indifferent face of the American society.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":805,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"genre":["Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-06","keywords":"one word title,forename as title,female protagonist,title appears in writing,emigrant","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3756910/","name":"Patrycja Planik"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3161822/","name":"Andreas Horvath"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0757097/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010329/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0326911/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3161822/","name":"Andreas Horvath"],"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Instinctively, I went with this; I clicked Order and hoped for the best.\n\nThis was by far the most moving film I have ever seen. To give you a quick synopsis, our protagonist, Dodge, teams up with the overly optimistic and happy-go-lucky Penny, a fellow apartment complex resident, to travel to his high school sweetheart's house to tie loose ends before the world comes to an apocalyptic close.\n\nSteve Carell truly nailed his performance. The audience watches his random heartbreak, internal conflict, and journey to love. Other reviewers have stated the film was "dull" and "weak" - but those reviewers also admit to fast forwarding and getting up. If they were smart, they would've waited, because that is all part of the film's magic. As a viewer, I felt like in the first 15 minutes I was at a standstill. I felt like I didn't even know what I was watching, almost uncomfortable. I can now say that was done intentionally. How would we respond to hearing about the world, that we live in, ending in our near future? With dullness, stillness, and discomfort. The weakness is really a success on behalf of the filmmakers; the viewer is a character in this madness. Steve Carell strengthens this to new extremes.\n\nKeira Knightley is stunning. In physicality, but more importantly, in her character, Penny. I was instantly in love with this free willed, uppity character who says no to nothing but stands for everything good in this world: risk, love, spontaneity. Her mixed conflict juggling guilt, confusion, and optimism is portrayed impeccably through Keira's teary-eyed, heartfelt performance is truly astonishing; her ability to make the viewer feel as if they know her and relate to her is so beautiful and overwhelming. Again, the filmmakers did a wonderful job making the viewer feel as in love with her as other characters in the story are. \n\nWith these two spot-on, PERFECTLY cast performances, and a phenomenal vintage soundtrack to top it all off, I was left crying multiple times. I kid you not, I am a 16 year old male, cries at basically nothing, and sobbed the last ten minutes of the movie and countless times throughout. I highly recommend this to anyone who understands the underlying beauty in our hectic lives, and appreciates the time to take a step back and realize that life is short - and we are the lucky ones. Love carries us through life, and it is in that state-of-being where we are most in touch with humanity.\n\nMoved. Touched. Overwhelmed. I will never forget watching this movie for the first time.\n\nWhat would you do with the rest of your life if you had limited time left? After seeing this, I will make every second count.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":111743,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-06-22","keywords":"end of the world,title directed by female,long title,road trip,human extinction","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2149949721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyNjU0NDYxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAzMjkzNw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyNjU0NDYxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAzMjkzNw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As an asteroid nears Earth, a man finds himself alone after his wife leaves in a panic.

Well, with this movie, almost everything did. It's slow, boring, repetitive and overall just disappointing.\n\nAdam (Liam Hensworth) is a programmer (I think, because character development apparently wasn't a priority in this movie) who gets stuck in the middle of a feud between two tech giants, Wyatt and Goddard, played by Gary Oldman and Harrison Ford. And that's about as deep as the story goes.

But it's also wonderful- and haunting- because it evokes what it is to look back on something and remember things vividly, clearly, with a subjectivity that is startling in its scarred interior. This is child-actor Linda Manz, her first role in what is a relatively small career, and she voices, in grungy but fine vocal, from afar at times even as she's one of the principle players.\n\nShe's the kid sister of Bill (Richard Gere, a very good if not extraordinary performance compared to others), a factory worker who kills a man by accident and runs off with his girlfriend Abby (Brooke Adams), and the three of them end up working for a farmer (Sam Shephard), and soon there's a love triangle formed wrapped around an elaborate con of Bill and Abby being brother and sister. These are just the facts, but director Terence Malick isn't after just those, but after a sad look back from a perspective of wonderment and horror and a kind of fractured innocence. It goes without saying that since it is a Malick picture one will expect the painterly landscapes of the fields, those intimate close-ups with bugs and waving fields of grass. But Malick is able to put a unique vision into the perspective of that of a little girl, who is seeing and experiencing everything as it is, not as it may be really imagined or wanting to be.\n\nSo there's a lot of interest already just in the nature of the farming on this panhandle in early 20th century. But there's just little things, little fantastic bits that stick in your mind, probably forever: the workers in the field toiling away; the black man tap-dancing by the barn; the airplane circus people coming by and showing silent films. Most notably, as well, are near biblical visions like the plague (and extinguishing by lots of fire) of locusts. And through all of the many, many beautiful shots, there's a tender and perfectly tragic love story played out with great work by Adams and a young Shepherd. Manz too, I might add, is excellent in a role that could have been mucked up by anyone else (also trumping a later future first-time performance in Malick's own The New World with the woman playing Pocahontas).\n\nAnd as if the crisp eye of Malick and his DPs Nestor Almendros and Haskell Wexler weren't enough, there's Ennio Morricone on the soundtrack to boot. Here's a crucial part of Malick's success in translating the theme of remembrance and feeling both the moment and the mood of the whole period and characters in the film (sometimes combined): just listen to the theme of the movie, used later in movie trailers and commercials, as it reckons a nostalgic tinge for something that one can't firmly grasp but is felt deeply and without really fully knowing the whole scope. Overall, Days of Heaven is almost too good, too beautiful- it's the kind of picture that defines reputations, for better or worse. Like Malick's.

It is a complex and ambitious film in itself, with a duration of 3 hours of projection, which is the first series of what is planned to become a trilogy that deals with the history of China and the impact of the great transformations that this huge country and its people has gone through in the last 40 years. On many respects the film is sincere and courageous in addressing historical processes and economic and social changes that have been paid for with a huge human price: the policies aimed at restricting families to at most one child per couple, and the transition from planned economy to capitalism market, with dramatic consequences in the lives of millions of Chinese workers who lost their dull but safe employment due to the closure or downsizing of state-owned enterprises, people forced to re-profile and migrate to ensure their livelihoods. The film's size and the ambitions of director Xiaoshuai Wang did not stop him from making a deeply human movie based on a well-written story anchored in China's recent history, with characters that viewers in China and anywhere else in the world can identify with.\n\nWe are following the saga of two families from northern China during over three decades, from the ideological relaxation and economic liberalization of the 1980s to the capitalist abundance and socio-economic inequalities of the present. The Liu and Chen families live in the same crowded house, they all work in the same factory, they are neighbors and friends, the two boys of the families were born on the same day and grew up as brothers. The two families symbolically represent different destinies in these times of change. The Liu family remains at the level of simple workers and then small entrepreneurs, they hardly survive the economic shocks that will cause them to migrate to the south of developing China but also a personal tragedy when their only child drowns. The Shen family is more adaptable, earlier the woman reaches a political leadership position, later they succeed economically and make a fortune. Although families break up to reunite only in the end, their destinies remain tied to a secret that cannot be forgotten or erased, perhaps only eventually forgiven.\n\nThe two actors who played the roles of the Liu couple impress with the depth, realism and sensitivity of performances. They also convinced the Berlin Festival jury, which awarded them both acting prizes, and I can understand the reasons. The tragedy of losing a child has been represented on screens before, but so far we have not seen such a deep interpretation of the consequences of the demographic policy of the only child at the level of the family cell. Those who see will hardly forget. Director Xiaoshuai Wang alternates the broad takes that describe the complex landscapes of a country in transformation and industrialization, with the intimate ones in the inhabited (but not private) spaces that become familiar to us in all details. Realism alternates with aesthetics and the results are remarkable. The props are chosen carefully, every detail counts. The makeup is perfect. If we pat attention we realize how the director visually expresses messages that he could not make explicit in words. For example, some of the factory-filmed scenes depicting the 1980s include an implicit critique of dullness of life, clothing uniformity and ideological regimentation. The narrative of the film is divided into two parts with different structures, which could belong to different movies. In the first two hours we reconstruct the story of the two families, the conflicts and their evolution in sequences of flashbacks that gradually compose the image and develop the characters. The last hour of the film describes the reunion that takes place in or near contemporaneity, and proposes a reconciliation and a resolution of conflicts. Personally, I liked the first part more, the solution in the end has something too idyllic and too forced which made it look not completely credible. I was left with the impression that Xiaoshuai Wang is a director of great strength and depth who when allowed to develop his artistic and historical vision can lead a movie to admirable results.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3840,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-03-22","keywords":"china,non linear,nonlinear timeline,hospital,loss of son","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1042071321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlNmFjNjAtNjkwZS00NTU1LWJkM2ItZGIyNmVlZDRmMGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlNmFjNjAtNjkwZS00NTU1LWJkM2ItZGIyNmVlZDRmMGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4592524/","name":"Jingchun Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3619308/","name":"Mei Yong"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5035471/","name":"Xi Qi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911075/","name":"Xiaoshuai Wang"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0514744/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4461717/","name":"Mei Ah"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911075/","name":"Xiaoshuai Wang"}],"duration":"PT3H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The artist / husband's father suffered both ways as joining the Nazis too late, while his beloved aunt was sent away by his father-in-law, eventually to the gas chambers. But the father-in-law spends his post-war life in fear of Nazi hunters, even as he hides in plain sight.\n\nFeaturing a strong cast and realistic sets, this is a strong movie.

Along the way, it shows how Nazi and Soviet art have strong similarities in their realisms, while modern art can be conceptual jokes.\n\nThe humans are 2 families who, if they knew, were on opposite sides during the Nazi era. The artist / husband's father suffered both ways as joining the Nazis too late, while his beloved aunt was sent away by his father-in-law, eventually to the gas chambers. But the father-in-law spends his post-war life in fear of Nazi hunters, even as he hides in plain sight.\n\nFeaturing a strong cast and realistic sets, this is a strong movie. Still, from the director's Q+A from the Toronto International Film Festival, the idea of subjective truth that also infuses the film can be a distraction.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19597,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-03","keywords":"east germany,painter,doctor,forced abortion,pregnancy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1224587801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMThhNzU3YTktOTgwZS00OTY0LTgwNDctYmI1YWIyYTA1YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMThhNzU3YTktOTgwZS00OTY0LTgwNDctYmI1YWIyYTA1YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Never Look Away' follows thirty years in the life of artist Kurt Barnert (a character loosely based on Gerhard Richter).

It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no "stars" appeared in "Ex Machina" and "Eva", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":511079,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-01-21","keywords":"artificial intelligence,turing test,minimal cast,robot,robot human relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi744337689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young programmer is selected to participate in a breakthrough experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breathtaking female A.I.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2539953/","name":"Alicia Vikander"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1727304/","name":"Domhnall Gleeson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390816/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no "stars" appeared in "Ex Machina" and "Eva", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":511079,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-01-21","keywords":"artificial intelligence,turing test,minimal cast,robot,robot human relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi744337689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young programmer is selected to participate in a breakthrough experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breathtaking female A.I.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2539953/","name":"Alicia Vikander","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1727304/","name":"Domhnall Gleeson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390816/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The Star Trek movie 2009 does not disappoint.\n\nIf you are a fan of the original series, you will love how this movie brings in many of the qualities of the original. Kirk as a brash, no- holds-barred kid who fears nothing. Spock battling his biracial status. Bones with his country doctorness. Checkov not being understood by the computer because of his accent. Sulu sword fighting. Scotty being able to do anything and laugh about it. But Uhura being ultra sexy and manning up to Spock - that was just great.\n\nThe evil Nero as the nemesis, and what he does, is incredible. The movie moves fast and furious as this space ship from the future comes to destroy the past. Common theme, with a great twist around Spock and Vulcan. \n\nLove the action. Love the ending how Kirk and Spock conspire and like in the originals, split second timing saves the day. When the bad guy gets his due, you will cheer when Kirk says - You got it.\n\nIt's an enjoyable fast-paced movie that will have you cheering and leave you wanting more. Enjoy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":593455,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-05-13","keywords":"automobile,car,part of series,bra,father son relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Star Trek: Final Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1761608473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MzczMDE3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY4NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MzczMDE3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY4NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the final theatrical trailer for Star Trek, directed by J.J.

The Star Trek movie 2009 does not disappoint.\n\nIf you are a fan of the original series, you will love how this movie brings in many of the qualities of the original. Kirk as a brash, no- holds-barred kid who fears nothing. Spock battling his biracial status. Bones with his country doctorness. Checkov not being understood by the computer because of his accent. Sulu sword fighting. Scotty being able to do anything and laugh about it. But Uhura being ultra sexy and manning up to Spock - that was just great.\n\nThe evil Nero as the nemesis, and what he does, is incredible. The movie moves fast and furious as this space ship from the future comes to destroy the past. Common theme, with a great twist around Spock and Vulcan. \n\nLove the action. Love the ending how Kirk and Spock conspire and like in the originals, split second timing saves the day. When the bad guy gets his due, you will cheer when Kirk says - You got it.\n\nIt's an enjoyable fast-paced movie that will have you cheering and leave you wanting more. Enjoy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":593455,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-05-13","keywords":"automobile,car,part of series,bra,father son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Star Trek: Final Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1761608473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MzczMDE3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY4NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MzczMDE3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY4NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the final theatrical trailer for Star Trek, directed by J.J.

The film was directed by 2 Guns director Baltasar Kormakur and written by William Nicholson (Gladiator, Les Miserables) and Oscar winner Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours), starring Jason Clarke, John Hawkes and Josh Brolin. To start the film is beautiful; the director of photography Salvatore Totino presented the size and scale of the environment beautifully with multiple aerial shots. Totino has a clear and linear style, which is refreshing after the summer, which with the exception of a couple of films, has been dominated by shaky-cam and extremely quick cuts.\n\nThe dialogue in the film stands out, however the plot does not. The characters were underdeveloped, partially due to the lack of introduction that is given to our main characters; this combined with the slow pace of the first act causes the film to drag. However it should be noted that the film makes a point of showing the process of preparing to climb Everest. The second act is fine, not great though and is intense especially during the storm and finally the film just finishes, which really throws you out of the film. \n\nAlthough none of the performances in the film were award-worthy they still were acceptable and in some cases quite good. Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin had the meatiest roles, and they both provided good performances. However out of the two, Jason Clarke provided the best performance. The side characters were forgettable, with the exception of Doug (John Hawkes) and Yasuko (Naoko Mori), with Doug being a postman and Yasuko finally completing the seven summits, two things which helped to distinguish them. Everyone in the film was 'care-beared', thankfully, and they had to be otherwise it would impossible to tell who you were looking at.\n\nOne part of production that deserves praise in this film is the lighting department who did a superb job on presenting a clear environment; especially during the storm. A quick side note- the score of the film was forgettable. \n\nUltimately, Everest is an intense drama thriller that has its problems, however is still beautiful to watch, I wouldn't purchase it on 3D Blu-ray, as after watching it in 3D I didn't find anything spectacular or noteworthy, however I would consider buying it on Blu-ray.

The plot developed really well and made it more of a "thinking movie" than I anticipated.

One thing I do know, is that when I find a good TV series, I stick with it. I have done precisely that with CSI, although it has taken its time to grow on me. However once it did, I cannot miss a minute of it. Considering that Australian TV has had many 'crime' based TV shows in the past and the present, it is refreshing to watch an American spin on the crime' theme. CSI is now a weekly viewing ritual that I could not imagine being without.\n\n The crime is committed and the scene is set. Then it is time for it to be investigated. This is Crime Scene Investigation (C.S.I.), which is all about a team of Las Vegas Criminalists working the graveyard shift at the Las Vegas Crime Lab. The team is led by veteran Gil Grissom with Catherine Willows, Nick Stokes, Warrick Brown, and Sara Sidle. They are all on the look out for the clues, which could make the difference in their next big case.\n\nNot seeing the first series in its entirety has not hindered my love for this show. In fact it has made me appreciate it all the more. This show is the creation of big-time Hollywood man, Jerry Bruckheimer. But there are other people that deserve praise when it comes to bringing this show to our small screen.  All of the directors and producers make this show flow beautifully. Add in the fascinating and interesting stories that have been written make for one terrific show. I especially enjoy how the show has so much packed into each episode. Having two or more cases in every show gives it the perfect feel and pace. I also like how some episodes have all the evidence collected by the certain members of the CSI group, but that it is still not enough to convict anyone (or group) of a crime, whether it be a murder, assault or theft.  \n\nThen look at what a great cast has been assembled for this show. I like the people who are all a part of CSI. The main man is Gil Grissom, the boss of CSI. He is portrayed well by William L. Peterson. I like how his character shows how he uses all his past experience to help solve a case. The people under Grissom include Catherine Willows (Marg Helenbeger), Nick Stokes (George Eads), Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan), and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). All these characters are different, challenge each other, in addition to being careful not to get to close to their victims or suspects. I find the way all these people get their job done to be of the utmost professionalism.\n\nIf this group were real crime-busting team, I am sure I would like them on my case, whether I was or related to a victim. This show is so good to watch, whether you are in a stressful job or in a family situation, as it is relaxing and educational. I hear that there is a spin off series called CSI Miami'. I am not sure whether this series will be better than its predecessor, but one thing is for sure  I will more than likely giving it a chance to mesmerise me like CSI has.

One thing I do know, is that when I find a good TV series, I stick with it. I have done precisely that with CSI, although it has taken its time to grow on me. However once it did, I cannot miss a minute of it. Considering that Australian TV has had many 'crime' based TV shows in the past and the present, it is refreshing to watch an American spin on the crime' theme. CSI is now a weekly viewing ritual that I could not imagine being without.\n\n The crime is committed and the scene is set. Then it is time for it to be investigated. This is Crime Scene Investigation (C.S.I.), which is all about a team of Las Vegas Criminalists working the graveyard shift at the Las Vegas Crime Lab. The team is led by veteran Gil Grissom with Catherine Willows, Nick Stokes, Warrick Brown, and Sara Sidle. They are all on the look out for the clues, which could make the difference in their next big case.\n\nNot seeing the first series in its entirety has not hindered my love for this show. In fact it has made me appreciate it all the more. This show is the creation of big-time Hollywood man, Jerry Bruckheimer. But there are other people that deserve praise when it comes to bringing this show to our small screen.  All of the directors and producers make this show flow beautifully. Add in the fascinating and interesting stories that have been written make for one terrific show. I especially enjoy how the show has so much packed into each episode. Having two or more cases in every show gives it the perfect feel and pace. I also like how some episodes have all the evidence collected by the certain members of the CSI group, but that it is still not enough to convict anyone (or group) of a crime, whether it be a murder, assault or theft.  \n\nThen look at what a great cast has been assembled for this show. I like the people who are all a part of CSI. The main man is Gil Grissom, the boss of CSI. He is portrayed well by William L. Peterson. I like how his character shows how he uses all his past experience to help solve a case. The people under Grissom include Catherine Willows (Marg Helenbeger), Nick Stokes (George Eads), Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan), and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). All these characters are different, challenge each other, in addition to being careful not to get to close to their victims or suspects. I find the way all these people get their job done to be of the utmost professionalism.\n\nIf this group were real crime-busting team, I am sure I would like them on my case, whether I was or related to a victim. This show is so good to watch, whether you are in a stressful job or in a family situation, as it is relaxing and educational. I hear that there is a spin off series called CSI Miami'. I am not sure whether this series will be better than its predecessor, but one thing is for sure  I will more than likely giving it a chance to mesmerise me like CSI has.

They are all on the look out for the clues, which could make the difference in their next big case.\n\nNot seeing the first series in its entirety has not hindered my love for this show.

But there are other people that deserve praise when it comes to bringing this show to our small screen.  All of the directors and producers make this show flow beautifully. Add in the fascinating and interesting stories that have been written make for one terrific show. I especially enjoy how the show has so much packed into each episode. Having two or more cases in every show gives it the perfect feel and pace. I also like how some episodes have all the evidence collected by the certain members of the CSI group, but that it is still not enough to convict anyone (or group) of a crime, whether it be a murder, assault or theft.  \n\nThen look at what a great cast has been assembled for this show. I like the people who are all a part of CSI. The main man is Gil Grissom, the boss of CSI. He is portrayed well by William L. Peterson. I like how his character shows how he uses all his past experience to help solve a case. The people under Grissom include Catherine Willows (Marg Helenbeger), Nick Stokes (George Eads), Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan), and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). All these characters are different, challenge each other, in addition to being careful not to get to close to their victims or suspects. I find the way all these people get their job done to be of the utmost professionalism.\n\nIf this group were real crime-busting team, I am sure I would like them on my case, whether I was or related to a victim. This show is so good to watch, whether you are in a stressful job or in a family situation, as it is relaxing and educational. I hear that there is a spin off series called CSI Miami'.

One thing I do know, is that when I find a good TV series, I stick with it. I have done precisely that with CSI, although it has taken its time to grow on me. However once it did, I cannot miss a minute of it. Considering that Australian TV has had many 'crime' based TV shows in the past and the present, it is refreshing to watch an American spin on the crime' theme. CSI is now a weekly viewing ritual that I could not imagine being without.\n\n The crime is committed and the scene is set. Then it is time for it to be investigated. This is Crime Scene Investigation (C.S.I.), which is all about a team of Las Vegas Criminalists working the graveyard shift at the Las Vegas Crime Lab. The team is led by veteran Gil Grissom with Catherine Willows, Nick Stokes, Warrick Brown, and Sara Sidle. They are all on the look out for the clues, which could make the difference in their next big case.\n\nNot seeing the first series in its entirety has not hindered my love for this show. In fact it has made me appreciate it all the more. This show is the creation of big-time Hollywood man, Jerry Bruckheimer. But there are other people that deserve praise when it comes to bringing this show to our small screen.  All of the directors and producers make this show flow beautifully. Add in the fascinating and interesting stories that have been written make for one terrific show. I especially enjoy how the show has so much packed into each episode. Having two or more cases in every show gives it the perfect feel and pace. I also like how some episodes have all the evidence collected by the certain members of the CSI group, but that it is still not enough to convict anyone (or group) of a crime, whether it be a murder, assault or theft.  \n\nThen look at what a great cast has been assembled for this show. I like the people who are all a part of CSI. The main man is Gil Grissom, the boss of CSI. He is portrayed well by William L. Peterson. I like how his character shows how he uses all his past experience to help solve a case. The people under Grissom include Catherine Willows (Marg Helenbeger), Nick Stokes (George Eads), Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan), and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). All these characters are different, challenge each other, in addition to being careful not to get to close to their victims or suspects. I find the way all these people get their job done to be of the utmost professionalism.\n\nIf this group were real crime-busting team, I am sure I would like them on my case, whether I was or related to a victim. This show is so good to watch, whether you are in a stressful job or in a family situation, as it is relaxing and educational. I hear that there is a spin off series called CSI Miami'.

I was worried when I saw the pilot that they were going to shoot their premise in the foot but was impressed at the end when they gave you a new basis that could last longer than a few episodes. Now if we're fair and judge this show on it's writing and acting rather than on our excitement that Nathan Fillion is back then we must conclude... that the show is still pretty good. I have been impressed with the story lines up to this point and while the short description of the "who-dun-it" may sound like scenarios we've heard before, these writers aren't satisfied with a "Law and Order" ending. They've already thrown out the triple and quadruple switchbacks with the uncovering of the culprits.

I was worried when I saw the pilot that they were going to shoot their premise in the foot but was impressed at the end when they gave you a new basis that could last longer than a few episodes. Now if we're fair and judge this show on it's writing and acting rather than on our excitement that Nathan Fillion is back then we must conclude... that the show is still pretty good. I have been impressed with the story lines up to this point and while the short description of the "who-dun-it" may sound like scenarios we've heard before, these writers aren't satisfied with a "Law and Order" ending. They've already thrown out the triple and quadruple switchbacks with the uncovering of the culprits. And all the while allowing Nathan Fillion to fill the screen with his smarmy charm and allowing him to cavort with an attractive, albeit, hard-boiled female cop.\n\nThe great part about this show is that they haven't really set up Fillion as a Sherlock Holmes. He is playing a seemingly educated street-wise poetic guy, but he isn't the one with all the answers. For every conclusion he draws, the female lead makes just as many and may refine Fillion's, which is wise on the writers' part because his character works because of the inherent flaws that come with being a writer rather than a detective.\n\nIt's a clever show that's a must-see if you're a Fillion-atic and a pretty good hour even if you're not.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":152893,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-03-09","keywords":"female detective,new york city,homicide investigation,novelist,crime writer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277213/","name":"Nathan Fillion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065664/","name":"Stana Katic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0838360/","name":"Susan Sullivan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097246/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0163896/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

It appeared tacked on, as if the producer's wife said to him if you don't stick this on, no more amour for you Cherie. To me it almost ruined the movie, so turn it off about 10 minutes from the end, you'll know when. It would have got 10 stars from me but for that.

I liked the way it was filmed and directed. A good story, the script was tight, the actors very good and I engaged well in their characters. None of them were particularly likable either. I loved the sound track too, some great tunes. A shock for me was the ending, last 10 minutes. It appeared tacked on, as if the producer's wife said to him if you don't stick this on, no more amour for you Cherie. To me it almost ruined the movie, so turn it off about 10 minutes from the end, you'll know when. It would have got 10 stars from me but for that. But having said that if you're into Hollywood style huggy, tears and let it all out crap in slow mo with a wincingly appropriate tune, let it roll.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24792,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-10-20","keywords":"unrequited love,gay,vacation,secret,restaurant","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi462273049","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQ1MmZlNjItYTdkNi00NTlkLTk0NDgtOTIyMmQ3YTY2OGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQ1MmZlNjItYTdkNi00NTlkLTk0NDgtOTIyMmQ3YTY2OGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0167388/","name":"François Cluzet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0182839/","name":"Marion Cotillard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536095/","name":"Benoît Magimel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0133899/","name":"Guillaume Canet"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044413/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048273/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086683/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0133899/","name":"Guillaume Canet"],"duration":"PT2H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was worried when I saw the pilot that they were going to shoot their premise in the foot but was impressed at the end when they gave you a new basis that could last longer than a few episodes. Now if we're fair and judge this show on it's writing and acting rather than on our excitement that Nathan Fillion is back then we must conclude... that the show is still pretty good. I have been impressed with the story lines up to this point and while the short description of the "who-dun-it" may sound like scenarios we've heard before, these writers aren't satisfied with a "Law and Order" ending. They've already thrown out the triple and quadruple switchbacks with the uncovering of the culprits. And all the while allowing Nathan Fillion to fill the screen with his smarmy charm and allowing him to cavort with an attractive, albeit, hard-boiled female cop.\n\nThe great part about this show is that they haven't really set up Fillion as a Sherlock Holmes.

Hoo, boy.\n\nI guess I'll just start by saying this (spoilers ahead), the changes they made to the origin story don't make any goddamn sense, both in terms of simple logic and quality narrative structure. They completely removed any connection between Splinter and the Shredder, so say goodbye to any emotional connection or tension that that would have brought. And this version Splinter wasn't the ninja master, Hamato Yoshi or even a pet/student of Yoshi. In fact, Yoshi seems to have been omitted completely. So, how does Splinter become a ninja master himself? He reads a book. I'm not even joking. After both he and the turtles mutate he finds a book and teaches himself. And it wasn't even at the very beginning. I mean when Splinter begin teaching himself, the turtles are already walking and talking. He not only learned all of ninjitsu but also somehow mastered it, without any instruction or sparring, in less than ten years? AND he taught it to the turtles? BULLSHIT.\n\nThe turtles themselves are one of the few not-terrible parts of the movie. All of there individual personalities are right where they should be but we are also kind of short-changed on the amount of interaction they have with each other. A bunch of brothers together, getting up to shenanigans? What a great, natural way to have conflict! But no, the movie follows April way too much.\n\nAll of that is indicative of a larger problem with the writing. Both of the villains are BORING. The pacing is uneven and a lot of the dialogue is forced and ham-handed, Michelangelo was the worse in that respect. And believe me, I get it. Mikey is the loud mouth, party turtle. But is is possible (kind of necessary) that if a main character is annoying, to also be likable. Yes, it possible. Severus Snape. Perry Cox. Deadpool. These are all characters that are bad or annoying people but still likable as characters. After a few minutes of listening to Michelangelo, I just wanted him to shut the hell up. \n\nIt doesn't get any better with the villains. I don't remember the last time I watched a movie with such boring villains. Instead of just sticking with one main villain, the Shredder, we now have two...for some reason. WE have Eric Sachs, who is a rich scientist/industrialist and the Shredder, an evil ninja master with no personality. Eric Sachs is working for the Shredder for money? But isn't he already like a billionaire with a castle on a mountain and his own skyscraper?Doe he need more money? What the hell for? Shredder is the most shallow and one-dimensional out of this whole damn movie. We're not really told anything of his back story or shown any of his motivation for anything. The foot clan is also no longer a group of ninja warriors, they're...guys with guns. Completely useless guys with guns (that'll be relevant later).\n\nThey also unnecessarily tie April, Sachs and April's dad into the turtles' back story...for some reason. We don't even really meet April's father. And April is the one who saved them from the lab fire that killed her father...or wait, was it Eric who killed her father? The movie seems to confused on that point. And instead of keeping the baby turtles (like any little girl who likes animals would do) she...dumps them in the sewer? What the hell? The who thing is convoluted and doesn't make any damn sense.\n\nApril O'Neil is uninteresting and stupid. Seriously, I mean she is unintelligent. She is supposedly an educated journalist but spends so much time trying to convince he boss of a "story" of talking, crime- fighting turtles without one single goddamn lick of evidence. Vernon Fenway is apparently supposed to be the comic relief but none of his jokes are funny and his sole role in the film seems to be driving April around. And why the hell is Whoopi Goldberg in this? She had like six lines. Why is she here?\n\nThe camera-work was clichéd and chaotic. There were times when the camera was moving around too much for you to easily follow the action. There is also a serious lack of cool martial arts fights for a NINJA Turtles movie, which is not surprising when you turn their main antagonists from ninja into guys with guns. I also couldn't even begin to take the Shredder serious in the action scenes. Are those giant swiss army knives on his hands? What the hell?\n\nFinally, the one thing, in my opinion, that sort of breaks the movie the most is that they made the turtles too damn powerful. Yes, the turtles are kind of superheroes. But wasn't being a bunch of kick-ass ninjas enough? No? You gotta give them super strength too? AND MAKE THEM BULLET PROOF!? Remember the previously said bit about the foot being a bunch of guys with guns? Yeah...you might see where I am going with this. It was bad enough to see the turtles throwing cars around and shattering concrete with punches. On some level, the audience needs to believe on some sort of fundamental level that the heroes are danger, that the threats that they face have meaning. Without that, there is no tension, no real conflict and with that...no excitement. No story.\n\nThis movie nuked the fridge.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":206328,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-09-03","keywords":"turtle,ninja,sewer,mutant,18 wheeler","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi295480345","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjczMjQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM3NjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjczMjQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM3NjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Darkness has settled over New York City as Shredder and his evil Foot Clan have an iron grip on everything from the police to the politicians.

I attended the premiere of CARS at LMS on Friday, May 26. True to Disney form, the premiere itself was spectacular. Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the "original", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep. As always, don't leave your seat until all of the credits roll. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie! You'll love them this time, as they tie back to prior Pixar movies, in a car sort of way. This is definitely a movie we'll add to the DVD collection. I really hope this movie does well since it's the first release since Disney bought Pixar. Don't go in looking for the action or adult humor of The Incredibles. If you do you'll be disappointed. Just go in looking for the "Disney always has a good moral behind its animated movies" type of movie and you will really enjoy it. Paul Newman and Larry the Cable Guy really have the best characters in the movie. And while John Ratzenberger's character doesn't have a lot of screen time, I really enjoyed him! I'll be going back to see it when it releases in theaters so I can get a better feel for the sound, as it wasn't the best in an outdoor setting. In my opinion, it easily beats the other animated movies released over the past year or so.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":393517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-09-06","keywords":"car,car movie,route 66,truck,tow truck","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"How the Best Racing Films Raise the Stakes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi365149977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief, sponsored by Coca-Cola, we're putting the pedal to the metal on the best racing films of all time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001372/","name":"Bonnie Hunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460146/","name":"Jorgen Klubien"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the "original", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep. As always, don't leave your seat until all of the credits roll. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie! You'll love them this time, as they tie back to prior Pixar movies, in a car sort of way. This is definitely a movie we'll add to the DVD collection. I really hope this movie does well since it's the first release since Disney bought Pixar. Don't go in looking for the action or adult humor of The Incredibles. If you do you'll be disappointed. Just go in looking for the "Disney always has a good moral behind its animated movies" type of movie and you will really enjoy it. Paul Newman and Larry the Cable Guy really have the best characters in the movie. And while John Ratzenberger's character doesn't have a lot of screen time, I really enjoyed him! I'll be going back to see it when it releases in theaters so I can get a better feel for the sound, as it wasn't the best in an outdoor setting. In my opinion, it easily beats the other animated movies released over the past year or so.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":393517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-09-06","keywords":"car,car movie,route 66,truck,tow truck","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"How the Best Racing Films Raise the Stakes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi365149977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief, sponsored by Coca-Cola, we're putting the pedal to the metal on the best racing films of all time.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001372/","name":"Bonnie Hunt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460146/","name":"Jorgen Klubien"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The Bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is "universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing.\n\nFirst, I highly advise you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to Ultimatum. There may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like I was.

Jason Bourne is played very well by Matt Damon. Damon does nothing to deserve an Oscar nod, but his work here is good enough to hold it's own. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. The agency tracking Bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down.\n\nI won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. However, it wouldn't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. Ultimatum wouldn't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front.\n\nIt seems most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $69 million, and -box office total now is up to $216 mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since August 3.

Really?","reviewBody":"Okay, for the record, this was a lousy film. But did it deserve the sort of bombastic universal panning it received? It was not nearly in the league of such absolute bombs as Gigli, Black Dog or anything with Rutger Hauer. It was a formulaic, wish-fulfillment movie worthy of being a Lifetime Special or an ABC Movie of the Week. It sucked, but it wasn't the sort of movie that scars one for life.

The aliens are smart, their inventive, and their just plain fun when seeing how they identify themselves and hide their identities. The story is funny and will keep you laughing at almost every scene.\n\nThe presentation of aliens as everyday people trying to live normal lives in Manhattan is a lot more fun than the presentation of murderous aliens (Independence Day). Another great part is that the film isn't overblown with special effects of alien explosions and massive battles. Instead comedy and chemistry keeps this top comedy flowing. \n\nMen In Black.

The sequel to the popular "Step Up" was obviously not as good as the first (sequels and prequels never really are) but it was a fun film to watch.\n\nThere was a few good comedic scenes, and the street dancing really was incredible, especially at the end of the movie. This kind of movie is obviously going to be a little bit predictable and cheesy, but still- it's fun to see with some friends on a Saturday night.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack really helped improve the movie; there were many excellent, cool songs playing throughout the film, such as "The Way I are" by Timbaland and "Low" by Flo-rida ft. T-Pain.\n\nIf you give it a chance, you may enjoy it. It depends on whether or not you enjoy feel-good, funny dance movies. If not, then don't go see it!

The sequel to the popular "Step Up" was obviously not as good as the first (sequels and prequels never really are) but it was a fun film to watch.\n\nThere was a few good comedic scenes, and the street dancing really was incredible, especially at the end of the movie. This kind of movie is obviously going to be a little bit predictable and cheesy, but still- it's fun to see with some friends on a Saturday night.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack really helped improve the movie; there were many excellent, cool songs playing throughout the film, such as "The Way I are" by Timbaland and "Low" by Flo-rida ft. T-Pain.\n\nIf you give it a chance, you may enjoy it. It depends on whether or not you enjoy feel-good, funny dance movies. If not, then don't go see it! The final verdict: Step Up 2 is a moderately fun film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86014,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-06-04","keywords":"dance off,dancing in the rain,dance movie,dance audition,dance crew","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Step Up 2 the Streets","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1253179673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MTAyOTYzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMzNjAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MTAyOTYzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMzNjAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Step Up 2 the Streets Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1382207/","name":"Robert Hoffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0263759/","name":"Briana Evigan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0144260/","name":"Cassie Ventura"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0160840/","name":"Jon M.

Thus overall it was average. Wreck it Ralph is one of my favorite animated films - it managed to be an homage to retro gaming whilst telling a story about a misguided but loveable 'bad guy' finding out what really matters in life.\n\nRalph Breaks The Internet undoes all the good the first one did - Ralph is now an abusive (or should I say 'insecure') friend who has not one, but TWO cliche 'We were best friends and everything was perfect but now you did something that's upset me so I'm going to walk away and DON'T FOLLOW ME moments'. The film lacks any subtletly in dealing with its themes of toxic relationships (both personal and over the internet), and is far more comfortable in its amusing Internet references than it is in trying to make a statement.\n\nThere were so many missed opportunities to link it with the first film. For example, it is made clear that the allure of modern games is that they're constantly being updated and feel new. This was the perfect chance for the film to show that retro games, that always stay the same and live in our memory, have merit too. But nope, that didn't happen. To me, it feels like a Disney exec wanted to tell a story of the dangers / joys of the internet, and the dangers / joys of clingy friendships, but forced these messages into Wreck it Ralph where it just doesn't fit.

Thus overall it was average. Wreck it Ralph is one of my favorite animated films - it managed to be an homage to retro gaming whilst telling a story about a misguided but loveable 'bad guy' finding out what really matters in life.\n\nRalph Breaks The Internet undoes all the good the first one did - Ralph is now an abusive (or should I say 'insecure') friend who has not one, but TWO cliche 'We were best friends and everything was perfect but now you did something that's upset me so I'm going to walk away and DON'T FOLLOW ME moments'. The film lacks any subtletly in dealing with its themes of toxic relationships (both personal and over the internet), and is far more comfortable in its amusing Internet references than it is in trying to make a statement.\n\nThere were so many missed opportunities to link it with the first film. For example, it is made clear that the allure of modern games is that they're constantly being updated and feel new. This was the perfect chance for the film to show that retro games, that always stay the same and live in our memory, have merit too. But nope, that didn't happen. To me, it feels like a Disney exec wanted to tell a story of the dangers / joys of the internet, and the dangers / joys of clingy friendships, but forced these messages into Wreck it Ralph where it just doesn't fit. It's used as a vehicle for this message, weaving its way around a bombardment of internet references in trying to do so.\n\nI can understand why people enjoyed it - I laughed a lot during the first half, and one or two of the emotional moments were quite powerful. But in lacking any nuance or any reverence to the first film, I cannot recommend it to fans of the first.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":147602,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2018-11-21","keywords":"wifi,internet,sequel,disney princess,computer animation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1706015257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY0YWVlYmEtOWNhOC00OWNmLWJiMGMtMzcyOWRhMTE2OGQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY0YWVlYmEtOWNhOC00OWNmLWJiMGMtMzcyOWRhMTE2OGQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Vanellope von Schweetz and Wreck-It Ralph leave the arcade world behind to explore the uncharted and thrilling world of the internet.

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":702453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":702453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"],"duration":"PT2H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Even though the movie seems to be everywhere in its storytelling, with characters being underdeveloped and random things just happening. I would say that during this movie, I had a hard time finding a bathroom break. I was at least interested to see where the movie is going.\n\nLet me try to explain this movie: There is this elite group of Green Lanterns led by Sinestro (well played by Mark Strong) who are having a hard time beating this giant alien in the Milky Way called The Parallax. So when their alien friend who's name I cannot remember falls to earth and dies, his ring is sent out to choose a new victim, and somehow it chooses Ryan Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds discovers that he has a new ability, and that he is the earth's only hope, but he can't handle that until the end of the movie. Not only that, but some doctor guy turns into an evil alien which, I guess, is controlled by Parallax, and Ryan has to stop him too.\n\nI must say that I was intrigued by the doctor subplot where he is not accepted by his father (Tim Robbins) and slowly goes insane until he turns into John Travolta from Battlefield: Earth. I also liked seeing Ryan Reynolds in the movie because he brings energy to what could otherwise be a boring movie, and I was enjoying both stories that were coming along.

One minute he's talking to this kid (which never served much purpose to the film) and then all of a sudden he's walking and gets carried away in green light to that dying alien dude. This happened in more than one occasion. Also the CGI was all over the place, even on Reynold's outfit, and it's rather distracting. It's very vibrant and colorful (which is good), but it looked very cartoonish and took me out of the film. I also mentioned that the characters are underdeveloped, which goes a lot to Sinestro and that Parallax thing they are trying to fight. Heck, even the love interest felt underdeveloped. By the end of the film, I felt like I barely knew the characters, with just a likable performance by Ryan Reynolds.\n\nHowever, Green Lantern isn't boring, just purely average. I think the reason why I sort of liked this film was that I went into it not expecting much.

What if I told you that this film had a setting of only one main location, two main actors and three supporting cast members?  While these elements don't make up what a classic movie sounds like on paper, add director Joel Schumacher (Bad Company, 8mm) into the mix, along with screenwriter Larry Cohen, who had this story handed down to him by Alfred Hitchcock himself about 30 years ago, and you have the perfect blend of blackmail, violence and extortion:  Phone Booth. The story begins by showing a glimpse into the life of Stu Shepard (Daredevil's Colin Farrell).  Stu is a New York hustler that people love to hate.  He is egotistical, two-faced to everyone he knows and does what he can for personal gratification.  He even fantasizes about cheating on his wife Kelly (Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell) and the object of that desire is Pamela McFadden (Dawson Creek's Katie Holmes).  Pam is a young actress trying to get her first break, while Stu has been grooming her for the big time.  To avoid having his calls to Pam appear on his cellular phone bill, Stu calls her from the lone phone booth left in the heart of NYC. However, things would be different on this day.  Upon hanging up, he receives a call that would turn his whole world upside down. The caller (24's Kiefer Sutherland) is a sniper, who has been targeting high-profile underhanded suits, just like Stu.  He has a few simple rules so that Stu does not meet the same fate that two others had before him: don't leave the booth, don't tell anyone who he's talking to, and most importantly, don't hang up.  To prove his seriousness, the caller shoots and kills a pimp who tries to physically remove Stu from the booth for taking too much time with his call.  This, as expected, does not help matters, and the fallen pimp's hookers now believe it was indeed Stu who committed the murder.  Soon, the NYPD and numerous media outlets are covering this serious situation. Things become increasingly difficult for Stu Shepard as Kelly and Pam both show up.  In the meantime, the caller continues to play various mind games, while the sympathetic NYPD Captain Ramey (Twilight Zone's Forest Whitaker) tries to solve the issue.  During all of this, Stu tries to maintain his sanity and not risk any more lives.  His lies no longer matter.  As a result, he must now search his soul, discover himself and attempt to outsmart the caller, taking the game to a whole new level. The cinematography is outstanding. Schumacher uses the right angle for every shot, and manages to keep everyone's attention with quick pans and abrupt cuts.  In the end, the 80-minute movie seems longer but not because it is boring.  The biggest payoff comes with the twist ending that changes the film's outcome within sixty seconds. There was not one bad performance in Phone Booth.  Farrell's ability to convert his Irish brogue to a Brooklyn drawl makes his performance as Bullseye in Daredevil look like a child's school play when compared to the Broadway-level of acting he manages here.  While Mitchell and Holmes did not have lengthy parts, their roles added just enough to the story and they managed to perform up to the standards of their characters.  Forest Whitaker was a surprisingly great addition to the cast and his role as a sympathetic cop is one that's not often seen, and should thus be welcomed.  However, all of these actors are outshined by Kiefer Sutherland, who ends up being extremely creepy and one of the best antagonists in recent movie history by just using his voice. Will this win Best Picture at next year's Academy Awards? It probably won't.  However, with a great story, top-notch directing and a cast with great chemistry, what more could you ask for?  Out of a possible five stars, I give this the limit of five with desires to go even higher.  While I would go see it again and again, not everyone has the same tastes.

Each tale relies so heavily on those that came before or after that one can never be a truly all-encompassing work. Sure, the three-act structure can be utilized, but without the background info, nor the knowledge that more will be coming, watching a middle installment alone will leave you confused and disorientated. The reason I bring this up is the fact that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is good enough to warrant the praise and to put the idea in my head about whether to call it a masterpiece. The tone is perfect, the laughs are many, the darkness is charcoal black—how could this be the same director as the abysmal—in comparison to the rest of the series—Order of the Phoenix, David Yates? Two words   Bruno Delbonnel.\n\nWho is Delbonnel you may ask? Well, he is the brilliant cinematographer behind the camera. I may have blamed the failures of the fifth film on its screenplay as Steve Kloves was glaringly absent, (he being the writer of each other film, including this new one), but a film is a team effort. Therefore I guess maybe I shouldn't put all the accolades on one man now; I just feel absolutely compelled to do so because so many moments linger in my mind due to the beauty of their composition and use of their environments to stay interesting and exciting at all times. Visually, you cannot be bored. It just goes to show that it is never the director alone, but also the team he or she brings along. I like Yates and was surprised at how much I disliked his first foray in the Potter universe, granted, I felt the book itself was sub-par at best. Thankfully, he did not disappoint with his second of three, (make that four as book seven goes to a two-part finale), because, as it was with the novels, Half-Blood Prince is by far the best of the series—until Deathly Hallows of course. And adding the pedigree of a guy like Delbonnel, with films such as Across the Universe, A Very Long Engagement, and Amelie in his back pocket—all stunning works of art—only makes his job easier.\n\nI can't get over the use of close-ups throughout, or the multiple instances of framing used to hide something on screen. Oftentimes, the camera pans or cuts to reveal something in the fringes, to highlight the focal point when it's not centrally located, or literally move our eyes to exactly where the filmmakers want them to be. The blocking is superb with some scenes blurring the edges and keeping only our main object of interest in focus, timing and positioning executed with aplomb. And did I mention the close-ups? (Yes, I know I did.) One sequence, with Harry and Ginny running through a field of tall grass after intruding Death Eaters, is shot with a high speed pan to keep the characters crisp as the foliage darts and blurs in their wake. I'd be remiss not to mention the special effects as well, especially when dealing with the black smoke trails from Voldemort's flying goons as well as the wispy pensieve. Whether completely computer generated or practical dye clouds in water, the effect is pitch perfect, even dissolving each memory in sections, leaving important pieces, like young Tom Riddle, to be lingered on just a second longer than the rest.\n\nAs for the leads, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson are solid as usual, (Radcliffe showing some solid comedic chops after taking luck elixir), and Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley gets some room to break free. But it is the supporting roles that deserve notice. Helena Bonham Carter will scare children, so kudos to her, and Michael Gambon's Dumbledore will win even more hearts as his leader finally allows Potter into the inner circle of the plan to rid the world of Voldemort, it now being a circle of two. It is newcomer Jim Broadbent, however, as Professor Slughorn who steals the show. Broadbent is known for his many comical expressions and his rubber face is utilized to great effect here. A blowhard and man with many "friends", his jubilant smile and need to collect powerful and famous wizards for his Slug Club are ever-present, bringing some levity as well as effectively hiding the dark secret that lies beneath.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince succeeds in the details. It is an exercise in minimalism and showing only what is necessary to the plot. Condensing the novel better than ever done before, Kloves has given Yates the tools to make a film and not just a visual representation of the words. What had previously been done best by Azkaban's Alfonso Cuaron, this one works better at retaining more subplots and not stripping it quite so bare. Subtle hints are planted so no longwinded exposition is needed to make us, as an audience, feel stupid and lectured to. Instead Yates and crew allow us to show our intelligence and ability to use our eyes and memories to piece things together, making the experience more enjoyable as we believe we are solving the mysteries and not the director who is skillfully guiding us through. I'd say it couldn't get better than this, but my confidence in Yates has been renewed and my hopes that Deathly Hallows is treated with respect is at one hundred percent, so who knows what the future has to offer?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":510078,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2009-07-15","keywords":"school of magic,hereditary gift of witchcraft,murder,friendship,witchcraft","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince -- Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1061421849","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTI2Njk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3NDg0Mg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTI2Njk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3NDg0Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As Harry Potter begins his 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he discovers an old book marked mysteriously "This book is the property of the Half-Blood Prince" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.

Whether completely computer generated or practical dye clouds in water, the effect is pitch perfect, even dissolving each memory in sections, leaving important pieces, like young Tom Riddle, to be lingered on just a second longer than the rest.\n\nAs for the leads, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson are solid as usual, (Radcliffe showing some solid comedic chops after taking luck elixir), and Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley gets some room to break free. But it is the supporting roles that deserve notice. Helena Bonham Carter will scare children, so kudos to her, and Michael Gambon's Dumbledore will win even more hearts as his leader finally allows Potter into the inner circle of the plan to rid the world of Voldemort, it now being a circle of two. It is newcomer Jim Broadbent, however, as Professor Slughorn who steals the show. Broadbent is known for his many comical expressions and his rubber face is utilized to great effect here. A blowhard and man with many "friends", his jubilant smile and need to collect powerful and famous wizards for his Slug Club are ever-present, bringing some levity as well as effectively hiding the dark secret that lies beneath.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince succeeds in the details. It is an exercise in minimalism and showing only what is necessary to the plot. Condensing the novel better than ever done before, Kloves has given Yates the tools to make a film and not just a visual representation of the words. What had previously been done best by Azkaban's Alfonso Cuaron, this one works better at retaining more subplots and not stripping it quite so bare. Subtle hints are planted so no longwinded exposition is needed to make us, as an audience, feel stupid and lectured to. Instead Yates and crew allow us to show our intelligence and ability to use our eyes and memories to piece things together, making the experience more enjoyable as we believe we are solving the mysteries and not the director who is skillfully guiding us through. I'd say it couldn't get better than this, but my confidence in Yates has been renewed and my hopes that Deathly Hallows is treated with respect is at one hundred percent, so who knows what the future has to offer?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":510078,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2009-07-15","keywords":"school of magic,hereditary gift of witchcraft,murder,friendship,witchcraft","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince -- Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1061421849","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTI2Njk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3NDg0Mg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTI2Njk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3NDg0Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As Harry Potter begins his 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he discovers an old book marked mysteriously "This book is the property of the Half-Blood Prince" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.

Nova priča zatječe Dianu Prince kako neprimjetno živi među smrtnicima u živahnim, elegantnim 1980-ima - eri hedonizma i želje za posjedovanjem. Iako je u potpunosti razvila svoje moći, ona ostaje pritajena, bavi se prikupljanjem drevnih artefakta, a herojska djela izvodi samo potajno. Međutim, Diana će uskoro morati skupiti svu svoju snagu, mudrost i hrabrost kad se sukobi s Maxwellom Lordom i Cheetom, zlikovkom koja posjeduje nadljudsku snagu i spretnost.</desc>

The musical transitions are the same, some of the set-ups are the same, some of the conflicts and revelations were eerily alike and worst of all, the entire third act felt like the original----and they are thousands of miles from the United States.

Yes, it is funny and there are indeed some standout moments. But, all the freshness and originality of the first Hangover is definitely not present here, and it hurts more because they could have fixed some of the setbacks of the original. This time Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married in Thailand in order to gain approval from his fiancée's father. During a night of drinking with the "Wolfpack" (Bradley Cooper, Zack Galifianakis, Justin Bartha) and the fiancée's brother, something went wrong, and the crew is many miles away in Bangkok. And of course, one of them is missing. And of course, they don't remember anything. And of course, they are mixed up in multiple situations occurring within the city. The difference between this one and their stint in Vegas is that the stakes are much higher, as the adventure in Thailand is much more grim and dark than in Sin City. \n\nHangover part one was hilarious, unique, and had flair of comedic originality. However, it needed a few polishes in order to become a true comedic classic. Zach as Allen is the biggest of the flaws. His characterization in the original was very uneven, too random, and just didn't deliver as much sympathy as the other characters. In the sequel, he is ruder, crueler, and an absolute pain to witness. In the original his actions are mildly justified because of his stupidity. Here however the stupid act gets old extremely fast. It doesn't help that Galifianakis doesn't have the comedic timing that superior funnymen possess. The rest of the cast throughout the movie was great, with Ed Helms and Ken Jeong being the best examples. \n\nTodd Phillips should have known better, as he is a good director with a nice track record. I am extremely disappointed that instead of taking an approach to trying something new while still offering the same type of R-rated college humor, he chose to stick to the formula far too close. You can copy some of the jokes and get away with it, but to imitate the entire three-act structure of the original Hangover is nothing more than lazy and uninspired filmmaking. He still has a few tricks up his sleeve with a few raunchy and hilarious surprises, but far too much potential was wasted in order for me to forgive him. \n\nBottom Line: You will most likely have a good time watching this if you enjoyed the original. That being said, it will feel exactly like the original---except it's in Bangkok and the setting is much darker. They cranked the ante in conflict, but failed to improve anything or change anything from the 2009 comedy smash hit. Playing it safe hindered this movie, as part of Hangover's appeal was its inability to stick to a formula. Hangover II is funny, but lacks the satisfaction, zaniness, and appeal of the original. Hopefully they can spice things up for the third installment (you know it's coming out, stop lying to yourself) otherwise all I have to do is copy this review and paste it to the third chapter. \n\ndiac1987.blogspot.com Entire Planet Observed on Daily Basis","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":482247,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-05-26","keywords":"wedding,strip club,pubic hair,hangover,bachelor party","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Hangover: Part II - Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2196348185","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTE0Njc0MDFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDUzNjU0MjMx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTE0Njc0MDFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDUzNjU0MjMx._V1_.jpg","description":"Phil, Stu, Alan and Doug travel to Bangkok for Stu's wedding.

The Hangover Part II simply changed nothing at all, and offered nothing new with the attitude of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." What will please fan's the most with The Hangover Part III, is that is does not follow the same formula that the first two did. However, a lot of fan's will be headed into disappointment when they realize that this third instalment decides to take a completely different change in direction than that of its predecessors. And by completely, I mean very much drastically.\n\nThe story follows the Wolf Pack yet again as they try to help Alan (Zach Galifianakis) get back on track due to him being off his meds, and soon enough they get thrown into a Mission Impossible-esque mission to save their friend Doug (Justin Bartha, who yet again takes a miss on all the excitement) from Marshall (John Goodman), an angry gangster who wants' the Wolf Pack to find Chow (Ken Jeong, who has a much larger screen time in this instalment) and return to him to them with 21 million dollars in gold bricks that he stole. If not, Doug gets the offing. \n\nA major plot point is the development of Alan. His friends Phil and Stu (Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms) are mature and grown men who have happily settled down, but he is still very much stuck as a spoilt rotten teenager within a man's body, and his life is going nowhere. Throughout the adventure, it really is a tale about Alan and watching him grow into the man he should have become years ago. Fans of The Hangover owe it to themselves to watch it, whatever their final opinion of it may be.\n\nWhereas The Hangover Part III doesn't match the quality of its first part, it definitely doesn't deserve all the negativity it has been getting. The film does a good job of balancing the well known Hangover humour with the Mission Impossible-esque set pieces, and all the recurring stars do well reprising their roles. One of the biggest changes that The Hangover Part III entails is that there is no actual drinking/hangover sequence. There's also no wedding or no missing person (or a pot smoking monkey). Instead, it plays it much straighter and it knows what it wants to set out to do, which is to stray far away from the formula of the first two chapters. And by doing so, it makes the finale to The Hangover Trilogy one to remember.\n\nMy Verdict: The Hangover Part III is a fitting end to the trilogy, but despite its changes in directions fans will be divided, resulting in a love or hate for this final chapter.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":305151,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2013-05-29","keywords":"heart attack,giraffe,breast implant,prostitute,karaoke bar","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2312742425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This time, there's no wedding.

And by completely, I mean very much drastically.\n\nThe story follows the Wolf Pack yet again as they try to help Alan (Zach Galifianakis) get back on track due to him being off his meds, and soon enough they get thrown into a Mission Impossible-esque mission to save their friend Doug (Justin Bartha, who yet again takes a miss on all the excitement) from Marshall (John Goodman), an angry gangster who wants' the Wolf Pack to find Chow (Ken Jeong, who has a much larger screen time in this instalment) and return to him to them with 21 million dollars in gold bricks that he stole. If not, Doug gets the offing. \n\nA major plot point is the development of Alan. His friends Phil and Stu (Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms) are mature and grown men who have happily settled down, but he is still very much stuck as a spoilt rotten teenager within a man's body, and his life is going nowhere. Throughout the adventure, it really is a tale about Alan and watching him grow into the man he should have become years ago. Fans of The Hangover owe it to themselves to watch it, whatever their final opinion of it may be.\n\nWhereas The Hangover Part III doesn't match the quality of its first part, it definitely doesn't deserve all the negativity it has been getting. The film does a good job of balancing the well known Hangover humour with the Mission Impossible-esque set pieces, and all the recurring stars do well reprising their roles. One of the biggest changes that The Hangover Part III entails is that there is no actual drinking/hangover sequence. There's also no wedding or no missing person (or a pot smoking monkey). Instead, it plays it much straighter and it knows what it wants to set out to do, which is to stray far away from the formula of the first two chapters. And by doing so, it makes the finale to The Hangover Trilogy one to remember.\n\nMy Verdict: The Hangover Part III is a fitting end to the trilogy, but despite its changes in directions fans will be divided, resulting in a love or hate for this final chapter.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":305151,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2013-05-29","keywords":"heart attack,giraffe,breast implant,prostitute,karaoke bar","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2312742425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This time, there's no wedding.

But after the first half I realized that this is definitely not a comedy. Since Drew Barrymore has been known for doing many romantic comedies, I thought this one will be one of them. Even though this idea of switching places have been done before many times, the idea of the film about a movie star with anger management issue, as she steps out of the spotlight and becomes a recluse, is interesting in a way. It's very poorly executed. Mainly it's because it's very hard to sympathize with either characters, Candy black is very mean and foulmouthed, and her stand-in who seemed like a nice person at first, turned out to be an opportunist, who wants to steal her identity and become a movie star herself. I guess the only normal character was Michael Zegen, except the weird story he tells about the Nazi incident !!!! Also in what world is the stand-in supposed to be an exact copy of Candy Black, with her obvious change in her nose, and why does she speaks in this weird tone of voice?? Drew Barrymore is a lovely actress, but this film is very bad on some many levels. What a waste of talent for great supporting actors like T.J. Miller, Ellie Kemper and Holland Taylor. Now that we know it's not a comedy, I wish i could say it's a drama, or a thriller, but it's also not that.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3075,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-12-11","keywords":"actress,timeframe 2020s,timeframe 21st century","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3136274713","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDhmMGVhMzktMjQwNC00YWIyLWI0ZWEtMzU0ODQzNjcwOWU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDhmMGVhMzktMjQwNC00YWIyLWI0ZWEtMzU0ODQzNjcwOWU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When ordered to serve a year in rehab, actress Candy (Drew Barrymore) hires her on set stand-in to take her place.

It had everything a great Pixar film has: a wonderful setting, fantastic CGI, beautiful and interesting characters, and a lot of heart. In fact, Merida alone was such an interesting and adorable character, that it was instantly on my to watch list. Granted, this isn't Pixar's best, but that's holding it up to extremely high standards. As an animated film, however, this is a fantastic and fascinating film, a treat for the summer.\n\nBrave tells the story of the aforementioned Merida, a young, Scottish princess whose life is controlled by her mother so that she can be shaped into a queen someday over the surrounding tribes. In an effort to change her fate and be free of her oppressive, but loving mother, she attempts to change her fate, and in the process makes a huge mistake. I won't get into plot details, as the trailer really doesn't give a lot away in terms of what this film is really about, but suffice to say, there is plenty of fun and adventure to be had.\n\nPixar always manages to create an interesting and unique tale, and this goes right up there with the best of them. Using the Scottish highlands is both an inspiring choice and allows them to craft a beautiful film. With sweeping mountains, water, and thick and colorful forests, this is one of Pixar's best looking films to date. It trumps the jungles of UP and even the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo. There is a certain amount of magic in the environments alone, and gazing on it is a wonder. The characters are also fantastic. Merida is a wonderful addition to Disney's princess lineup, and unlike those others, she is no damsel in distress. She, like her mother, is perfectly capable of handling herself, with her trusty archery skills and even tackles a few dangerous situations on her own instead of having someone there to save her. In fact, this could be seen as an inverse, as Merida actually becomes a hero in many ways and triumphs over the males in her own age bracket. Also of note is Billy Connolly, voicing Fergus, who lends his comedic chops to create a wonderful and likable character.\n\nWhile this film may not be up there with Pixar's best, it still has a wonderful story and character interaction. Merida's relationship with her family feels genuine and most children will probably be able to relate. At the heart of the story is her relationship with her mother. This is more than a story about fate, but a story about obligations to family and how growing up means taking responsibility and putting away childish selfishness in place of those responsibilities. Although the core plot is unconventional and unexpected, it has a fantastic heart and once again proves that Pixar can tell a story like no other.\n\nBrave is an entertaining, humorous, and heartfelt story that will be wonderful for kids and adults alike. Merida is a wonderful new character and the entire film looks beautiful. Even if you don't have children, I recommend this film if you've loved other Pixar's before it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":392722,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-08-15","keywords":"princess,mother daughter relationship,archery,female warrior,rebellious daughter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Families Legend","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi678863641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTM4NTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA4MDI3Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTM4NTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA4MDI3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Determined to make her own path in life, Princess Merida defies a custom that brings chaos to her kingdom.

The images were so great, the storyline was typical but fun, the characters were well-defined, and the sound was emotive and effective.  And, who could not love a flick that makes references to The Shining, Psycho, and other quality films?\n\nI seriously got attached to the little Clown fish, Nemo.  The movie just sucked me in.  Anyway, watch it.  It's worth your time, especially if you enjoy Pixar animation.  The first 10 minutes is a visual overload in a good way.  Very good way.\n\nBy the way, the voice of Jesus (Willem Dafoe) embodied by a Tiger fish? Awesome.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":996540,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-03","keywords":"pufferfish,shark,great barrier reef,short term memory loss,protective father","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"3D Re-release Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2687214105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMDYxNTUyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIwMjQ4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMDYxNTUyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIwMjQ4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After his son is captured in the Great Barrier Reef and taken to Sydney, a timid clownfish sets out on a journey to bring him home.

It reminds me of classics such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty.\n\nBest of all, the movie is not just all laughs and slapstick. It has heart too. Even the minor characters such as the King and Queen -- you can feel the emotions. And the romance is believable and not cheesy.\n\nLike I said, I was very pleasantly surprised.

Ever since their feature film debut, the magnificent 'Toy Story', the animation studio have brought us such instant classics as 'Monsters Inc.', 'The Incredibles' and 'Finding Nemo', a film which remains as one of the biggest selling DVDs of all time. Surely it's about time that they delivered us a bad film? Well, sorry to disappoint, but Pixar's 'WALL-E' is among not only their greatest work, but among the greatest animations ever produced.\n\nThe film opens with some astonishing shots of a desolate, rubbish-laden, polluted Earth; a boldly dark opening for a family oriented feature. It is amidst these dystopian surroundings, however, that our hero - arguably more adorable than a basket full of puppies and kittens - is first introduced to us. WALL-E is a character of genius; combining elements of Johnny 5, Charlie Chaplin and Mr. Bean, Andrew Stanton (Director) and crew have created something that will no doubt go down in history with R2-D2 as one as the screen's most memorable machines.\n\nIt is the 22nd Century, and mankind have left Earth in giant Space Cruisers waiting for the surface of their planet to finally become habitable again. 700 years have past, and WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), is the last of a group of robots left to clean up the planet. In a disturbing sequence, our hero ventures home through trash heaps laden with 'dead' WALL-E's... another sign that this is not the usually Pixar fare, but something more meaningful, more bold, more... adult in theme. And this is what the first act of the film is. WALL-E, accompanied by his pet cockroach (who, as a testament to Pixar's genius, we grow to care for just as much as the metal man himself), goes about his daily routine. It is in this mostly silent section of the film that we grow to love WALL-E. As he rumages through human garbage, finding interest in things that seem mundane to us, we discover that after all these years, this little robot has developed something that makes him seem more to us than an animated clunk of cogs and rust... a personality. His incredibly curious nature make for some of the most adorable moments depicted in film (including moments such as WALL-E meets car keys and WALL-E meets... bra). We delve further into this intriguing personality when we invited into the little guy's 'house', a storage space for all his collected junk. Whilst WALL-E watches a VCR of the musical 'Hello, Dolly!", we see from his large, emotional eyes and clasping hands that he is, heartbreakingly, all alone on this immense world.\n\nThen, the following day, as WALL-E goes about his trash-cube-making business, something extraordinary, both to us and WALL-E, occurs. A space ship touches down on the surface, holding within it EVE, a futuristic, Ipod-resembling droid here to scout the earth for plant-life... and WALL-E's one true love (aww).\n\nThis love story eventually leaps from Earth into space and onto The Axiom, an immense Space Ship on which a large number of the American population - depicted as lazy, obese, consumerist slobs - go about the same mundane routine day in, day out. Message heavy, but never preachy. In the end, through WALL-E, everyone learns the true meanings of life: Love and the relationships with those around us. Oh, and to take care of the planet, of course.\n\nBeautiful visuals, astonishing characterisation and a sequence with WALL-E and EVE floating through space that is more romantic than anything your likely to see this year, make 'WALL-E' an outstanding achievement that proudly stands among Pixar's finest work. WALL-E is a completely realised character, and one which I am sure we have not seen the last of. Although, some would argue, not as accessible as other films in the genre (some children may grow resteless during the film's earlier, dialogue-free sequences), 'WALL-E' will leave a lasting impression on cinema goers of all ages.\n\nAnd that is the genius of Pixar. The only studio ever to create films that are, truly, 'for all the family'. \n\n-Dan Henry, 20th July 2008","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1057247,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"robot,obesity,recycling robot,adrift in space,cgi animation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wall E","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192703769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njc2MTYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njc2MTYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Wall E - Trailer #3"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123785/","name":"Ben Burtt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2264184/","name":"Elissa Knight"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307531/","name":"Jeff Garlin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0622634/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714114/","name":"Jim Reardon"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Tu su i njezine tri prijateljice: Samantha Jones, vlasnica PR agencije, koju više zanima usputni seks nego dugotrajne veze, Miranda Hobbes, cinična odvjetnica kojoj je karijera ispred nestabilnog ljubavnog života i Charlotte York, kustosica u galeriji koja je mrvicu konzervativna kada je riječ o seksu, ali još nije izgubila vjeru u to da će pronaći pravu ljubav. Serija "Seks i grad" temelji se na uspješnici koju je napisala Candace Bushnell. Radnja se vrti oko života četiriju mladih, uspješnih žena u potrazi za savršenom vezom... I orgazmom!</desc>

We dread the incredible security measures. We get to see the planning and the development. We marvel at the skills of each expert. We experience the same suspense and drama as the characters. Ocean's Twelve discards all these elements in favor of creative editing, avant garde camera work and superficial writing. It tries to extract great performances from so-so actors. O.K. so they all are beautiful people. That doesn't mean they are automatically the best actors. It doesn't mean that they can carry a film on their performances. Clooney and Pitt are no Newman and Redford. The acting talents of Catherince Zeta-Jones have never been anything to write home about. Only Finney in a tiny cameo draws any real emotion from the audience.\n\nThe best heist movies have real suspense. This film has none. The outcome is never in doubt. No matter how the surface of the plan is seemingly foiled...everyone is in on the far deeper "actual" plan.\n\nOn major problem is Garcia's character. \n\nIf the original "11" successfully pulled off the job we are made to believe they did in the first film, they wouldn't panic and crumble like a house of cards to Benedict's pressure and scare tactics. In fact, once a member of the cadre had been contacted, survelliance would have captured Benedict's strong arm tactics and bellicose threats immediately. The man would have legal challenges beyond belief. \n\nIt's not enough to know who robbed you.

We dread the incredible security measures. We get to see the planning and the development. We marvel at the skills of each expert. We experience the same suspense and drama as the characters. Ocean's Twelve discards all these elements in favor of creative editing, avant garde camera work and superficial writing. It tries to extract great performances from so-so actors. O.K. so they all are beautiful people. That doesn't mean they are automatically the best actors. It doesn't mean that they can carry a film on their performances. Clooney and Pitt are no Newman and Redford. The acting talents of Catherince Zeta-Jones have never been anything to write home about. Only Finney in a tiny cameo draws any real emotion from the audience.\n\nThe best heist movies have real suspense. This film has none. The outcome is never in doubt. No matter how the surface of the plan is seemingly foiled...everyone is in on the far deeper "actual" plan.\n\nOn major problem is Garcia's character. \n\nIf the original "11" successfully pulled off the job we are made to believe they did in the first film, they wouldn't panic and crumble like a house of cards to Benedict's pressure and scare tactics. In fact, once a member of the cadre had been contacted, survelliance would have captured Benedict's strong arm tactics and bellicose threats immediately. The man would have legal challenges beyond belief. \n\nIt's not enough to know who robbed you. You must have proof, otherwise the worst threats would be a laughing matter for seasoned pros.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":376690,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2004-12-15","keywords":"heist,sequel,pretending to be pregnant,father daughter relationship,reference to spongebob squarepants","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Twelve","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1989804313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxNzQ0NjAtNmI0MS00NzQ5LTkxNzItMjExMWU0M2Q0MTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxNzQ0NjAtNmI0MS00NzQ5LTkxNzItMjExMWU0M2Q0MTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024560/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1079776/","name":"George Nolfi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425138/","name":"George Clayton Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751207/","name":"Jack Golden Russell"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It had been a long time I laughed like that watching a movie. Unexpectedly, I never thought it would be. Meghan Miles was amazing.

Jackson has now solidly replaced Spielberg.\n\nMost folks know that the 1933 "Kong" changed the world in fundamental ways. The world of movie imagination was in its earliest phases, so quite apart from the innovations of animation and dramatic scoring, the engineering of the narrative was radical and important -- the idea of making a movie about making a movie. Was it the first major film with such explicit folding?\n\nIt is a movie about the making of a movie that gets out of hand so the inner movie takes over the enclosing one. Then a larger crew gets involved and subdues the "beast" (the energy of the thing) and recasts it as a slightly different type of show, the "real" thing. This also gets out of hand in the same way. The form is nominally a beauty and the beast love story, but inside it is a similar beauty and the beast story about the notions of dangerous storytelling.\n\nFortunately, we have the Jackson of "Forgotten Silver," "Heavenly Creatures" and "Meet the Freebles," all in this family of reflection.\n\nThis Kong sets the human lover as the actual playwright who (literally) is writing what we see as we go along. He intends to be outside the play, but gets swept up in it as the venture (again, literally) leaves with him aboard. When looking for an actress, Denham asks about Fay, and is told she is filming something for RKO, the original Kong, in fact.\n\nThe big layer is that when the Kong show comes to 1933 New York, the costumes and music are from the 1933 film. How clever, to overlap the layer of original-remake with that in the story of movie within layered on the "real" thing. The business about the monster coming off the stage/screen and entering the audience is a fold-shifting device visited many times since.\n\nI understand there are a quite a few more subtle 'movie within the movie" touches that Jackson intends to add in the DVD cut. We see one in the trailer where the inner filmmaker is directing Ann to scream. \n\nJackson cleverly adds in a few narrative references as well. This is an intelligent filmmaker, after all. The obvious one is "Heart of Darkness," (and by reference, "Apocalypse Now"), which he slips in explicitly and then satirizes by that quaint foolishness of the mentor and lost boy.\n\nBut the insertion he makes that is not explicit is the one that fascinates me: "The Tempest," sort of a touchstone for this notion of folded narrative and how it is added as yet another layer is a pleasant surprise.\n\nIf (shame) you don't know the Tempest, here is an outline: a magician (Shakespeare who is both in the play and writing it) lives on a lost island with magical creatures. He conspires to raise the titular tempest which brings a shipload of folks to the island where he works his magic. His conjuring of the tempest presumably goes back in time to include all the events leading to the reasons the people are on the ship.\n\nThe tempest involves an enveloping fog, rocks that appear from nowhere and no escape for experienced mariners.\n\nOnce on the island, there are a few plays-within-plays created and manipulated by the magician, some exposure to the feral animal energies of the place, and a love between a young couple. There's much ado about the abject loneliness of our magician.\n\n(Incidentally, implicit in this Kong story is that this monster ape is the very last in the line. When he takes his new love to see the sunset, he takes her past the family boneyard. There, you can see that there was a long line of giants before him that at each stage had a loved companion where he does not.)\n\nQuite apart from that, you can see Ted's law at work here and in "The Tempest." That law holds that when you have two layers, a film and a play or film within, the distance of abstraction between us and the outer film is the same as that between the outer film and the inner one. This is true in the four explicit inner plays: the movie Denham makes, the play Jack writes (where he talks to himself about love), the Kong show (which references the 33 movie) and the stage performances Ann does throughout, including for Kong (which is pure Jackson).\n\nAll this business about narrative dimension is mirrored in the physical dimensions as well. Jackson knows how to work in the three dimensions that animation gives him the freedom to exploit. At least we got that out of his adventures with fascist romantic cosmology. If you just watched the fight between Kong and the two dinos suspended by vines as they and we swoop about, you'd get your money's worth. And that would be both in entertainment and knowing you are seeing something that will change all action movies that follow. The planes at the end have camera perspectives we haven't seen before as well.\n\nThis is a masterwork. My one complaint is the lack of sex. Yes, I know. Mooneyes are enough, and anything more works against the abstraction of the thing. But that business about smell in the 33 version was piercingly raw and human. It is a shame that to sell big it had to be replaced with some business about her "entertaining" him. But it does keep the performance levels straight.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":410409,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-01-25","keywords":"gorilla,king kong,island,new york city,jungle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4100440345","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5YjhlYzgtZWY2Yy00NDYwLTgyMjUtODI4ZDBmNTkzNWVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5YjhlYzgtZWY2Yy00NDYwLTgyMjUtODI4ZDBmNTkzNWVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A greedy film producer assembles a team of moviemakers and sets out for the infamous Skull Island, where they find more than just cannibalistic natives."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085312/","name":"Jack Black"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004778/","name":"Adrien Brody"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0135516/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909638/","name":"Fran Walsh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0101991/","name":"Philippa Boyens"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"duration":"PT3H7M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Personally, I think that Vin Diesel should continue making the movies from the other screenplays that have already been written. The plot in these films (TCOR and Pitch Black) is actually quite original. From an action standpoint, the films do not lack anything. Riddick is the bad ass anti-hero that we would all like to be sometimes and they couldn't have cast the parts any better.

Personally, I think that Vin Diesel should continue making the movies from the other screenplays that have already been written. The plot in these films (TCOR and Pitch Black) is actually quite original. From an action standpoint, the films do not lack anything. Riddick is the bad ass anti-hero that we would all like to be sometimes and they couldn't have cast the parts any better.

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Finkel(Jonah Hill)is a young up and coming journalist writing for the New York Times when his career is derailed after he plays a little fast and loose with some facts of a recently published article. While trying to plan the next chapter in his professional life he receives a call from a reporter looking to get an angle on the story about Longo. It seems that he was using Finkel's identity when he was captured in Mexico. Finkel is naturally curious but also smells a story that could put his career back on track.\n\nFinkel and Longo arrange to meet and what follows are a series of meetings where both men engage in a dialogue meant to extract as much information as possible from the other. But how much of what Longo shares is the truth? How does Finkel use the information he gets?\n\nThe main problem with this movie is the pay-off, or the lack thereof. The story is simply not as interesting as it sounds. Honestly, it's no ones fault. The direction by first timer Rupert Goold is solid, well paced, and true to the story.

Finkel(Jonah Hill)is a young up and coming journalist writing for the New York Times when his career is derailed after he plays a little fast and loose with some facts of a recently published article. While trying to plan the next chapter in his professional life he receives a call from a reporter looking to get an angle on the story about Longo. It seems that he was using Finkel's identity when he was captured in Mexico. Finkel is naturally curious but also smells a story that could put his career back on track.\n\nFinkel and Longo arrange to meet and what follows are a series of meetings where both men engage in a dialogue meant to extract as much information as possible from the other. But how much of what Longo shares is the truth? How does Finkel use the information he gets?\n\nThe main problem with this movie is the pay-off, or the lack thereof. The story is simply not as interesting as it sounds. Honestly, it's no ones fault. The direction by first timer Rupert Goold is solid, well paced, and true to the story. The acting is good even if it is a little weird to see Hill and Franco together in serious roles. The best way to describe it might be we all know someone(friend or family member) who is excited to tell a story of something that happened to them or something they witnessed and when they are done, looking to you for a reaction, all you can say is "Is that it?"\n\nThe most compelling aspect of the film is Finkel coming to grips with the fact that he has to determining what is the truth and what is a lie.

However, I can say that this film is one of the most uplifting and life affirming movies that I have ever seen. It left me both moved and confident that the world was not such a bad place after all.

The soundtrack by Thomas Newman (the Shawshank Redemption) went from chilling to the most beautiful melodies that I have ever heard (giving, in my humble opinion, any classical composer a run for their money), adding an extra depth to this film.\n\nThere are no in-betweens in this film: you WILL either love or hate this film. However, I can say that this film is one of the most uplifting and life affirming movies that I have ever seen. It left me both moved and confident that the world was not such a bad place after all. Just like the Shawshank Redemption told us that hope is not a bad thing, so Meet Joe Black tells us that indeed love can conquer all better than Titanic ever could.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":229526,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-11-13","keywords":"death,birthday,wealth,death personified,fear of death","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001231/","name":"Claire Forlani"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000976/","name":"Martin Brest"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045196/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0651592/","name":"Ron Osborn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0719734/","name":"Jeff Reno","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905458/","name":"Kevin Wade"],"duration":"PT2H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is a movie with heart warming and refreshing storyline. Michael Keaton stars as Jack Frost in this awesome movie about getting a second chance at being the world's greatest dad. Kelly Preston, Joseph Cross and Mark Addy co-star.\n\nI first noticed Joseph Cross, Charlie Frost, in the 100th episode of "Touched By An Angel" and since then I knew he was a talented young actor. Cross once again teamed with Keaton in "Desperate Measures" another awesome movie overlooked by the viewing audience.\n\n"Jack Frost" is the kind of movie that has heart-warming moments intertwined with comedic wit. Keaton and Cross seem to have a lot of fun making this movie together and it showed in their performances.

It is a movie with heart warming and refreshing storyline. Michael Keaton stars as Jack Frost in this awesome movie about getting a second chance at being the world's greatest dad. Kelly Preston, Joseph Cross and Mark Addy co-star.\n\nI first noticed Joseph Cross, Charlie Frost, in the 100th episode of "Touched By An Angel" and since then I knew he was a talented young actor. Cross once again teamed with Keaton in "Desperate Measures" another awesome movie overlooked by the viewing audience.\n\n"Jack Frost" is the kind of movie that has heart-warming moments intertwined with comedic wit. Keaton and Cross seem to have a lot of fun making this movie together and it showed in their performances.

    <desc lang="hr">Home Alone: Directed by Chris Columbus. With Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard.

He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family, which, right now, being around Christmas time, is about quadrupled, flooded by relatives' children, all of whom pick on poor, poor Kevin (sympathy long lost later into the film).\n\nOne day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true: his parents (John Heard and Catherine O'Hara) have disappeared. Enthralled by this, he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before, including eating ice cream in the morning, watching violent gangster films, jumping on the bed, wrecking his brother's room, and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!\n\nTrouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.\n\nJohn Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).\n\nAs for the acting.\n\nMacaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.\n\nJohn Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.\n\nAnd then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.\n\nPesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.\n\nAll in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.\n\n4.5/5 stars -","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":537336,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"1991-07-22","keywords":"christmas,home alone,slapstick comedy,burglary,child protagonist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Home Alone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi490651929","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE5NzE2ZDctODVkYS00MjZhLWI0N2YtYTkxZDFjMDU2MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE5NzE2ZDctODVkYS00MjZhLWI0N2YtYTkxZDFjMDU2MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer: 25th Anniversary Edition"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000346/","name":"Macaulay Culkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000582/","name":"Joe Pesci"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0827663/","name":"Daniel Stern"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073707/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000455/","name":"John Hughes"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!\n\nTrouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.\n\nJohn Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).\n\nAs for the acting.\n\nMacaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.\n\nJohn Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.\n\nAnd then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.\n\nPesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.\n\nAll in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.\n\n4.5/5 stars -","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":537336,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"1991-07-22","keywords":"christmas,home alone,slapstick comedy,burglary,child protagonist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Home Alone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi490651929","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE5NzE2ZDctODVkYS00MjZhLWI0N2YtYTkxZDFjMDU2MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE5NzE2ZDctODVkYS00MjZhLWI0N2YtYTkxZDFjMDU2MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer: 25th Anniversary Edition","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000346/","name":"Macaulay Culkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000582/","name":"Joe Pesci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0827663/","name":"Daniel Stern"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073707/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000455/","name":"John Hughes"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">The Pursuit of Happyness: Directed by Gabriele Muccino. With Will Smith, Jaden Smith, Thandiwe Newton, Brian Howe. A struggling salesman takes custody of his son as he's poised to begin a life-changing professional career." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0454921/","name":"The Pursuit of Happyness","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NjQ0NDI3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI0MjEzMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A struggling salesman takes custody of his son as he's poised to begin a life-changing professional career.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0454921/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"AgentDice"},"dateCreated":"2013-10-21","inLanguage":"English","name":"You got a dream... You gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it.","reviewBody":"No one would make a movie about a guy struggling to succeed who doesn't ultimately succeed. Certainly, no one would make a Will Smith movie about a guy who breaks under the strain of his difficult life, abandons his child and dies. That's just not going to happen. And because we know that -- because we've seen more than one movie in our lives -- "The Pursuit of Happiness" has a particular challenge: To take the real-life rags-to-riches story of stockbroker Chris Gardner, a story with a preordained happy ending, and imbue it with tension and suspense.\n\nThe great surprise of the picture is that it's not corny. It may have seemed that way from the trailer: Will Smith tells his son, "Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something -- even me." But in context, even that moment isn't cloying. The beauty of the film is its honesty. In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story depicted on screen, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story follows the pattern most common in life -- it chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats, missed opportunities, sure things that didn't quite happen, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. In other words, it all feels real.\n\nGabriele Muccino ("L'Ultimo Bacio") directed it, and his fine Italian hand can be detected in Andrea Guerra's score, with its Italianate wistfulness and whimsicality, and in Muccino's very European enjoyment of American poverty and desperation. He finds both on the streets of San Francisco -- circa 1981, in this case, but some things don't change -- and he films them in a way that we're always aware: Our hero works hard. He's doing everything he can, and he has a son he is raising on his own. Yet even without a false move on his part, just an extra push of bad luck, he might land on those streets, and with such a thud he might never rise.\n\nAs in all rags-to-riches tales, we find the protagonist, Chris, unappreciated and looked down upon at the start. He is struggling to make a go of it by selling bone-density scanners and spends his days lugging around a thing that looks like a movie projector case and hearing doctors tell him they're not interested. His wife disdains him. Actually, the treatment of the wife is the first hint that "The Pursuit of Happiness" is going to be an usually uncompromising movie. The wife (Thandie Newton) is a poisonous harpie, with no redeeming traits. The filmmakers are not messing around: Chris has it bad.\n\nIn fact, he is an extraordinary man, but no one is paying attention to him long enough to notice. He decides he wants to get an internship as a stockbroker for Dean Witter and, realizing that his resume looks weak, he sets out to meet the man in charge and say a few words on his own behalf. Throughout the film, had Chris had just a little more pride and a little less intelligence, he would blow it. But he remains friendly and resilient, never indulging in anger, never letting anyone else's mistaken perception of him wound him at his core. He stays fixed on his objective and warm in his response to the world -- and even then, things don't improve right away.\n\nHaving proceeded to establish Chris as a great guy, "The Pursuit of Happiness" puts him through hell. The wife leaving is just the beginning (actually that seems a little like good luck). Chris has to raise a son (played by Will Smith's own real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) and do an unpaid internship, while selling those bone-density scanners on the side. If it weren't for the soup kitchens at Glide Memorial, he and his son often wouldn't eat.\n\nWill Smith has the right quality for the role -- he's an easy man to root for -- but he augments this by channeling some inner quality of desperation and need. Frankly, I don't know where he found it; Smith was touched by luck at a very young age. Yet he does find it. In the taxicab scene, in which he tries to impress a prospective employer by solving the Rubik's Cube, and in every other scene in which Chris has to sit or stand there smiling while another man pronounces on his fate, Smith is right there with the right emotions: absolute hope and total terror.\n\nThis film is an amazing heartfelt performance certain to influence and motivate its audience to reach new heights. This film is based on a true gripping and dramatic story about a man who has nothing and his struggle toward success. The plot development can be slow but offers a lot of insight towards character development and explore these themes about patience and success and especially what motivates us and keeps us going. I recommend for everyone to watch this, whether rich businessman, student, or teacher for this will change everyone's perspective on life.\n\nIn short - Amazing movie. Very poignant, relevant and uplifting. Leaves you thinking about it for days!!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":481214,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-02-07","keywords":"motivational,passion,hardwork,hare krishna,american dream","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Pursuit of Happyness","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1413719065","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Pursuit of Happyness"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0628601/","name":"Thandiwe Newton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1535523/","name":"Jaden Smith"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0610831/","name":"Gabriele Muccino"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0175726/","name":"Steve Conrad"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Don't watch it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.6,"genre":["Comedy"],"actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0632475/","name":"Slobodan 'Boda' Ninkovic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417583/","name":"Jovan Janicijevic-Burdus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0667793/","name":"Milenko Pavlov"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417583/","name":"Jovan Janicijevic-Burdus"],"creator":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417583/","name":"Jovan Janicijevic-Burdus"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It stars Dragan Nikolic as Brana Mitrovic a.k.a. Floyd, a part-time race car driver and full-time freeloader. He's 27, still living with his parents and gives an impression of someone who hasn't put in too many hard working days in his life. Movie follows him through 7 key days of his life during which he:\n\n\n* tries to weasel out of mandatory military service by faking a kidney disease, \n\n\n\n* frantically looks for money to buy new tires for his Zastava Fiat as he's got a big race on the weekend, \n\n\n\n* is informed by his girlfriend Vukosava a.k.a. Silja (Gorica Popovic) with whom he maintains a very casual relationship that she's pregnant with his kid and wants to break up, etc, etc...\n\n\nMovie introduces a bunch of supporting characters too, of whom the most memorable are Mile rent-a-bubreg (Bogdan Diklic) and an eternal film student (played by Aleksandar Bercek) at the Faculty of Dramatic Arts who seems to have it in for famous Spanish surrealist director Luis Bunuel. The right ratio of comedy vs. poignancy is maintained throughout, as to avoid the movie becoming either too frivolous or too preachy.\n\nWill our flawed hero finally become a responsible adult or will he continue his womanizing, mooching and free-spending ways?

It stars Dragan Nikolic as Brana Mitrovic a.k.a. Floyd, a part-time race car driver and full-time freeloader. He's 27, still living with his parents and gives an impression of someone who hasn't put in too many hard working days in his life. Movie follows him through 7 key days of his life during which he:\n\n\n* tries to weasel out of mandatory military service by faking a kidney disease, \n\n\n\n* frantically looks for money to buy new tires for his Zastava Fiat as he's got a big race on the weekend, \n\n\n\n* is informed by his girlfriend Vukosava a.k.a. Silja (Gorica Popovic) with whom he maintains a very casual relationship that she's pregnant with his kid and wants to break up, etc, etc...\n\n\nMovie introduces a bunch of supporting characters too, of whom the most memorable are Mile rent-a-bubreg (Bogdan Diklic) and an eternal film student (played by Aleksandar Bercek) at the Faculty of Dramatic Arts who seems to have it in for famous Spanish surrealist director Luis Bunuel. The right ratio of comedy vs. poignancy is maintained throughout, as to avoid the movie becoming either too frivolous or too preachy.\n\nWill our flawed hero finally become a responsible adult or will he continue his womanizing, mooching and free-spending ways? Well, the movie doesn't say since this is not the kind of major transformation that happens over such a short period but by the end of the flick Floyd definitely doesn't look a care-free guy he did in the beginning of it.\n\nAs an aside, it is interesting to watch mid-to-late 1970s Belgrade in the background.

Don't watch it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.6,"genre":["Comedy"],"actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0632475/","name":"Slobodan 'Boda' Ninkovic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417583/","name":"Jovan Janicijevic-Burdus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0667793/","name":"Milenko Pavlov"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417583/","name":"Jovan Janicijevic-Burdus"],"creator":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417583/","name":"Jovan Janicijevic-Burdus"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I saw this film at the 1993 San Francisco film festival.\n\n Set in that brief golden bubble of time, between the fall of Communism in Yugoslavia, and the outbreak of ethnic bloodshed, the movie was made almost entirely in Belgrade (now in Serbia). A beautiful portrait of the breakdown of one family, and the miraculous creation of a new one. Director Goran Paskaljevic chose 12-year Nikola Sarkovic from over 800 boys. Their teamwork brought one of the  most compelling performances by a child actor to the screen. The film was completed in Aug 92, only days before the escalation of the bloody civil war in Serbia that made on-site location work for *any* films impossible. If this film ever finds distribution, you can NOT afford to miss it.\n\n Nikola plays a gritty young capitalist-wanna be. He has far more sense and maturity with money than either of his parents, (his self-obsessed mother, Ina Gogalova, or philandering father, Miki Manojlovic). While his father dreams unrealistically of building a home based on income from being a wedding musician, Nikola dreams of getting a pop corn machine at the race track, so his family can make "real" money. The boy has gradually assumed many of his parent's adult responsibilities. He helps relieve his mother, by caring for her elderly charges, and even surreptitiously prompts his father with the right things to say to overcome serious marital rifts based on the father's philandering.\n\n After his father gets a promotion in a music academy, with strings attached, Nikola steps in to center stage to hold things together. He must care for the three elderly charges his mother runs errands for (she's in Bulgaria&gt; seeking a quack cure for the ailing sister) *and* he must take on two new charges, relatives of his father's boss. Nikola has already grown close to Señor Julio Popovitch (brilliantly portrayed by former Yugo mega pop singer, Mija Aleksic.) Nikola finds a deep friendship with the spunky old Tango singer who refuses to "give in," even though he's virtually bed-ridden.\n\n[In the director's talk after the screening, Paskaljevic revealed that the ailing Aleksic hadn't been able to work for 7 years. He was only allowed to work for two to three hours a day, with his doctor in attendance. With Life imitating Art, this wonderful performer grew stronger and stronger as the film progressed, and his doctor's new "prescription" was for Aleksic to make more films!]\n\n With the company of a dog he's inherited from a recently deceased "client," the pragmatic Nikola decides to simultaneously baby sit all of his elderly charges by bringing them together in a friendship club. Therein the magic of this film begins; like parched flowers in a spring rain, these wonderful old people "bloom" through friendship, romance, and a new-found sense of purpose. The gift of Goran Paskaljevic's direction prevents this from turning into sappy, sentimental sop like SMALL CHANGE. In a sense, each of Nikola's charges finds their own "tango," or dance of life. The film follows a path pitted with the very cul 'd sacs and dead ends that await any of us cursed with living long enough to become a "bother" to our adult children.\n\n Much of the film's freshness comes from a deft script and Zarkovic's no-nonsense portrayal of the determined twelve-year-old. Far from being the lovable "artful dodger" type of moppet most of us were weaned on in countless Disney films, this is a pint-sized "adult" with a mission. He'll stop at nothing to build a stable financial base for his family. Like many work-a-holic adults, he's become so enmeshed in enabling others, that he's forgotten how to care for his own needs. Only briefly, near the end of the film, when we see Nikola frolicking nude on a Montenegro beach under the loving, watchful eyes of his elderly `tango singer' friend, do we see him act freely and fully as a child. While his "real" family crumbles around&gt; him, he unknowingly brings together an enduring extended family. Warning: TANGO ARGENTINO has one of the most devasting, loving endings you will have ever seen. (I saw it 8 years ago).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":762,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"1992-02-17","keywords":"boy,male female relationship,male nudity,child's point of view,seduction","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017988/","name":"Mija Aleksic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0543547/","name":"Predrag 'Miki' Manojlovic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953521/","name":"Nikola Zarkovic"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0664607/","name":"Goran Paskaljevic"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076194/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045857/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036689/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586235/","name":"Gordan Mihic"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The film follows a path pitted with the very cul 'd sacs and dead ends that await any of us cursed with living long enough to become a "bother" to our adult children.\n\n Much of the film's freshness comes from a deft script and Zarkovic's no-nonsense portrayal of the determined twelve-year-old. Far from being the lovable "artful dodger" type of moppet most of us were weaned on in countless Disney films, this is a pint-sized "adult" with a mission. He'll stop at nothing to build a stable financial base for his family. Like many work-a-holic adults, he's become so enmeshed in enabling others, that he's forgotten how to care for his own needs. Only briefly, near the end of the film, when we see Nikola frolicking nude on a Montenegro beach under the loving, watchful eyes of his elderly `tango singer' friend, do we see him act freely and fully as a child. While his "real" family crumbles around&gt; him, he unknowingly brings together an enduring extended family. Warning: TANGO ARGENTINO has one of the most devasting, loving endings you will have ever seen. (I saw it 8 years ago).","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":762,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"1992-02-17","keywords":"boy,male female relationship,male nudity,child's point of view,seduction","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017988/","name":"Mija Aleksic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0543547/","name":"Predrag 'Miki' Manojlovic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953521/","name":"Nikola Zarkovic"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0664607/","name":"Goran Paskaljevic"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076194/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045857/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036689/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586235/","name":"Gordan Mihic"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Nowadays, it can be hard to distinguish an action film from a video game. In fact there is one coming out soon that appears to be both. I guess studios these days feel that kids need something to see while resting their fingers after long days of playing their Nintendos/Playstations/whatever. So they come up with all of these PG-13 action films that are often mere meditations of comic books, toys, or old TV shows. Looking back at T2, one may find the action films of today sorely lacking in comparison.\n\nThe story of course deals with Arnold returning from the future to protect a boy who will some day lead the human resistance against a world run by machines. This time Arnold is the good guy (as per Schwarzenegger's request) and he's up against a lethal and much more advanced prototype sent to off the kid. The CGI used to create this new T-1000 terminator was jaw-dropping at the time this was released. Though technology to create such things is now infinitely more available, this has led to problems in my book. Now, there is too much done with computers, and stunts don't seem so wonderful if you know it was all done on a computer. Most of the stunts in T2 were live action and extraordinarily filmed using all types of vehicles and explosives. Director James Cameron really sold these stunts in terms of how he filmed them.\n\nNot all directors are a good as Cameron. That is a given. But directors looking at making action films should take note of other strengths found in the construction of T2. First of all, you don't need shaky camera movements to sell to your audience that there is an exciting or crucial scene happening. Here the photography is crisp and detailed. You see everything clearly that you need to see. Right down to the little things. The action sequences are perfectly blocked and the spacing between hostile parties is easy for the audience to figure out. We know who is shooting at who, and how far apart they are from each other. Cameron also made sure his entire cast was proficient with the weapons they were going to fire in the movie. And guns run out of ammunition and need to be re-loaded at appropriate times.

Nowadays, it can be hard to distinguish an action film from a video game. In fact there is one coming out soon that appears to be both. I guess studios these days feel that kids need something to see while resting their fingers after long days of playing their Nintendos/Playstations/whatever. So they come up with all of these PG-13 action films that are often mere meditations of comic books, toys, or old TV shows. Looking back at T2, one may find the action films of today sorely lacking in comparison.\n\nThe story of course deals with Arnold returning from the future to protect a boy who will some day lead the human resistance against a world run by machines. This time Arnold is the good guy (as per Schwarzenegger's request) and he's up against a lethal and much more advanced prototype sent to off the kid. The CGI used to create this new T-1000 terminator was jaw-dropping at the time this was released. Though technology to create such things is now infinitely more available, this has led to problems in my book. Now, there is too much done with computers, and stunts don't seem so wonderful if you know it was all done on a computer. Most of the stunts in T2 were live action and extraordinarily filmed using all types of vehicles and explosives. Director James Cameron really sold these stunts in terms of how he filmed them.\n\nNot all directors are a good as Cameron. That is a given. But directors looking at making action films should take note of other strengths found in the construction of T2. First of all, you don't need shaky camera movements to sell to your audience that there is an exciting or crucial scene happening. Here the photography is crisp and detailed. You see everything clearly that you need to see. Right down to the little things. The action sequences are perfectly blocked and the spacing between hostile parties is easy for the audience to figure out. We know who is shooting at who, and how far apart they are from each other. Cameron also made sure his entire cast was proficient with the weapons they were going to fire in the movie. And guns run out of ammunition and need to be re-loaded at appropriate times. Nothing seems artificial in a shootout.\n\nI could go on forever pointing out good qualities of this film. Just watching a bit of it on Bravo the other night reminded me why I saw it so many times in the theater. And this film was rated R! And it still made a fortune! That just proves if you make a good product, you don't have to dumb it down or tame it for the kiddies. If it's good enough, they'll find a way to see it! 10 of 10 stars.

One child is rescued by their nanny, the other by the family's bodyguard Frank Avery. Alex grows up rough in the orphanage where his nanny leaves him and becomes a criminal in the underworld, while Chad becomes a ladies' man and karate teacher under the guidance of Frank. After several decades, Frank finds Alex and reunites the two brothers in time to battle the same triads who are still in business.\n\nThe plot to this film opens with such violence in front of children that it alters the paths their lives were going to take. Surely this film shows the effects that young children witnessing violence can have  in this case the children are so badly affected that they both grow up to become Jean-Claude Van Damme! Aside from this terrible event, they come together decades later just as those that murdered their parents are doing a big deal. Of course the whole plot is silly and the whole idea behind the plot is to present two Van Damme's as some sort of major selling point  and I suppose for some it is. Ignoring a silly and rather irritating plot, this film does have plenty of trademark action from it's star(s?) and it is just about enjoyable on that level, even if there are plenty of better action films available to watch on a Saturday night in with beer!\n\nAttempts to inject drama into the film with sibling conflict and love interests are wasted and just further bog down an already limp script. Of course part of the blame for the lack of dramatic involvement must lie with Van Damme, who's delivery is as reliable as ever  and this is not a compliment. His characters are given very different hairstyle because we can't rely on Van Damme's performance to be able to tell them apart. However I will be fair to him and say that he has moves and delivers two very enjoyable scenes towards the end (one in shadows, the other with a drum). Shaw makes for an annoying love interest  in the time honoured manner all she does is scream. Lewis is a well known face but cannot life this to be anything more than it is. Van Damme's performance is dwarfed by a laughably bad turn from Alan Scarfe as the main villain  so hammy it should have been between bread.\n\nOverall this is not a very good film but, did you expect it to be? I came to expecting people to be kicked in the head and for the star to do the splits and talk with an accent and that's what I got. There are better films out there and it is far too basic to be really enjoyable but it has some good fights and exciting action albeit not enough to support the whole film. Worth seeing if you're just looking for an undemanding action movie to fill an hour or two."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40009,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime"],"datePublished":"1991-08-09","keywords":"vietnam war veteran,hero murders a woman,man murders a woman,ends with freeze frame,brother","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Double Impact","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1168245017","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFkZjZlMDItY2QzMC00ZTBlLWFkODgtZDgyZDE1MDcxMjliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFkZjZlMDItY2QzMC00ZTBlLWFkODgtZDgyZDE1MDcxMjliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"text os"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0507212/","name":"Geoffrey Lewis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0789585/","name":"Alonna Shaw"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504802/","name":"Sheldon Lettich"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042128/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046109/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504802/","name":"Sheldon Lettich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0576228/","name":"Steve Meerson"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One child is rescued by their nanny, the other by the family's bodyguard Frank Avery. Alex grows up rough in the orphanage where his nanny leaves him and becomes a criminal in the underworld, while Chad becomes a ladies' man and karate teacher under the guidance of Frank. After several decades, Frank finds Alex and reunites the two brothers in time to battle the same triads who are still in business.\n\nThe plot to this film opens with such violence in front of children that it alters the paths their lives were going to take. Surely this film shows the effects that young children witnessing violence can have  in this case the children are so badly affected that they both grow up to become Jean-Claude Van Damme! Aside from this terrible event, they come together decades later just as those that murdered their parents are doing a big deal. Of course the whole plot is silly and the whole idea behind the plot is to present two Van Damme's as some sort of major selling point  and I suppose for some it is. Ignoring a silly and rather irritating plot, this film does have plenty of trademark action from it's star(s?) and it is just about enjoyable on that level, even if there are plenty of better action films available to watch on a Saturday night in with beer!\n\nAttempts to inject drama into the film with sibling conflict and love interests are wasted and just further bog down an already limp script. Of course part of the blame for the lack of dramatic involvement must lie with Van Damme, who's delivery is as reliable as ever  and this is not a compliment. His characters are given very different hairstyle because we can't rely on Van Damme's performance to be able to tell them apart. However I will be fair to him and say that he has moves and delivers two very enjoyable scenes towards the end (one in shadows, the other with a drum). Shaw makes for an annoying love interest  in the time honoured manner all she does is scream. Lewis is a well known face but cannot life this to be anything more than it is. Van Damme's performance is dwarfed by a laughably bad turn from Alan Scarfe as the main villain  so hammy it should have been between bread.\n\nOverall this is not a very good film but, did you expect it to be? I came to expecting people to be kicked in the head and for the star to do the splits and talk with an accent and that's what I got. There are better films out there and it is far too basic to be really enjoyable but it has some good fights and exciting action albeit not enough to support the whole film. Worth seeing if you're just looking for an undemanding action movie to fill an hour or two.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40009,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime"],"datePublished":"1991-08-09","keywords":"vietnam war veteran,hero murders a woman,man murders a woman,ends with freeze frame,brother","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Double Impact","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1168245017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFkZjZlMDItY2QzMC00ZTBlLWFkODgtZDgyZDE1MDcxMjliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFkZjZlMDItY2QzMC00ZTBlLWFkODgtZDgyZDE1MDcxMjliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"text os","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0507212/","name":"Geoffrey Lewis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0789585/","name":"Alonna Shaw"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504802/","name":"Sheldon Lettich"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042128/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046109/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504802/","name":"Sheldon Lettich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0576228/","name":"Steve Meerson"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Worth seeing if you're just looking for an undemanding action movie to fill an hour or two.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40009,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime"],"datePublished":"1991-08-09","keywords":"vietnam war veteran,hero murders a woman,man murders a woman,ends with freeze frame,brother","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Double Impact","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1168245017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFkZjZlMDItY2QzMC00ZTBlLWFkODgtZDgyZDE1MDcxMjliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFkZjZlMDItY2QzMC00ZTBlLWFkODgtZDgyZDE1MDcxMjliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"text os","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0507212/","name":"Geoffrey Lewis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0789585/","name":"Alonna Shaw"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504802/","name":"Sheldon Lettich"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042128/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046109/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504802/","name":"Sheldon Lettich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0576228/","name":"Steve Meerson"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark tries to out-do its predecessor for breakneck spills and gross-out moments, but the sparkle isn't quite there. It's an entertaining film for sure, but not as good as the original, partially because the plotting this time round is a little awkward and partially because Kate Capshaw as the main female character is an almighty irritation.\n\nThe film opens in a Shanghai restaurant, where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) causes a riot in pursuit of a diamond. Fleeing the scene with American singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and teenaged pick-pocket Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), he escapes to the airport. However, Indy and his companions unwittingly board an airplane owned by one of Indy's enemies, from which they have to make an audacious mid-air escape when the real pilots bail out mid-flight! Soon, the intrepid trio find themselves in India, where they come across a village in the grip of starvation. The village children have been kidnapped by local cultists to work in a mine, digging for the sacred Sankara Stones, and Indy is persuaded by the distraught villagers to rescue their youngsters. His quest takes him to the opulent Pankot Palace and, beneath it and beyond a maze of tunnels, the Temple of Doom.\n\nFord is great as Jones, bringing genuine charisma to a role that he was born to play (can you imagine how things would have turned out if Tom Selleck had got the part, as originally planned?) There are some great moments along the way too, including the intentionally subversive opening sequence in Shanghai, a particularly funny and exciting runaway mine-train sequence, and an unforgettable banquet at Pankot Palace in which the food served up is enough to churn any stomach. But Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom still can't live up to the standard set by Raiders of the Lost Ark. As mentioned, Capshaw is a real pain on the senses as the always-squealing heroine, and the plot seems to over-stretch in an effort to link to the next development or set piece. The hunt-for-the-missing-children plot device allows Spielberg to dip into the kind of cloying sentimentality that occasionally mars his films too. This is certainly an entertaining and professionally assembled film, but in no way a rival or an equal to the excellence of its predecessor.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":469637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1984-05-23","keywords":"india,prequel,shanghai china,indiana jones character,white savior","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2444476697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5ZTE3OTItMThmZC00ZjdhLWExMDEtZWQ5MDFjMmM5NjJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5ZTE3OTItMThmZC00ZjdhLWExMDEtZWQ5MDFjMmM5NjJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001009/","name":"Kate Capshaw"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702841/","name":"Ke Huy Quan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071326/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404754/","name":"Willard Huyck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0441718/","name":"Gloria Katz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000184/","name":"George Lucas"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The mouse is a young Russian named Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), who arrives on the shores of the Volga River to defend Stalingrad, an important city in which the German's are attempting to capture. Zaitsev soon finds himself befriending a political officer named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), who is impressed by the soldiers quick skills and decides to glorify him through the local press. Zaitsev becomes a political icon for the locals, giving them encouragement and increasing their hope for victory. \n\n\tThe cat is an opposing sniper named Major Koenig (Ed Harris), a famous sharpshooter called upon to kill Zaitsev. Koulikov (Ron Perlman), another talented sniper, is assigned to help Zaitsev in killing Koenig before the Major takes a victory shot. To further complicate matters, Zaitsev falls in love with another soldier, Tania (Rachel Weisz), whose parents were killed by the enemies, and wants to redeem their honor. \n\n\t"Enemy At The Gates" certainly paints a vivid, graphic depiction of war. The atmosphere is unsettling and bleak, the characters are almost always dirty and sleepless, the fighting scenes consist of brief, short, instantaneous shots, but the sequences are fast-paced, genuine, and disturbing. The city looks battered and tormented. The dialogue goes hand and hand with the character's actions; the plot is challenging and the movie is focused, about something solid.

The movie tends to realize that, and concentrates a great deal of effort in making those scenes suspenseful and taut. \n\n\tJoseph Fiennes plays a meek, nervous character and does a good job at bringing him to life believably. Jude Law, whose last work in "The Talented Mr. Ripley" provides a tough act to follow, accomplishes great things with a determined and assiduous character. Ed Harris is the standout actor here, in a harrowing, steadfast, juicy performance. Rachel Weisz cannot do a whole lot with her character, however. She often feels strained and contrived.\n\n "Enemy At The Gates" tries hard to express the subject of the media's influence in our culture. If the film, co-written and directed by Jean-Jaques Annaud  ("Seven Years in Tibet"), would have stayed on that concept, it would have been a whole lot better. The romance between Zaitsev and Tania is kind of unnecessary, and I am not sure if the sex scene is obligatory or advances their relationship. This love side story lacks passion; a lot of it feels mechanical and routine. "Enemy At The Gates" is still a consistently intriguing war film-rare because it does not involve Americans. While we are never really concerned about the outcome of the actual war, nor do we entirely care about several aspects of the main characters, there are many good scenes of suspense, and the overall mood of the movie is effective.

This prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark tries to out-do its predecessor for breakneck spills and gross-out moments, but the sparkle isn't quite there. It's an entertaining film for sure, but not as good as the original, partially because the plotting this time round is a little awkward and partially because Kate Capshaw as the main female character is an almighty irritation.\n\nThe film opens in a Shanghai restaurant, where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) causes a riot in pursuit of a diamond. Fleeing the scene with American singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and teenaged pick-pocket Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), he escapes to the airport. However, Indy and his companions unwittingly board an airplane owned by one of Indy's enemies, from which they have to make an audacious mid-air escape when the real pilots bail out mid-flight! Soon, the intrepid trio find themselves in India, where they come across a village in the grip of starvation. The village children have been kidnapped by local cultists to work in a mine, digging for the sacred Sankara Stones, and Indy is persuaded by the distraught villagers to rescue their youngsters. His quest takes him to the opulent Pankot Palace and, beneath it and beyond a maze of tunnels, the Temple of Doom.\n\nFord is great as Jones, bringing genuine charisma to a role that he was born to play (can you imagine how things would have turned out if Tom Selleck had got the part, as originally planned?) There are some great moments along the way too, including the intentionally subversive opening sequence in Shanghai, a particularly funny and exciting runaway mine-train sequence, and an unforgettable banquet at Pankot Palace in which the food served up is enough to churn any stomach. But Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom still can't live up to the standard set by Raiders of the Lost Ark.

This prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark tries to out-do its predecessor for breakneck spills and gross-out moments, but the sparkle isn't quite there. It's an entertaining film for sure, but not as good as the original, partially because the plotting this time round is a little awkward and partially because Kate Capshaw as the main female character is an almighty irritation.\n\nThe film opens in a Shanghai restaurant, where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) causes a riot in pursuit of a diamond. Fleeing the scene with American singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and teenaged pick-pocket Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), he escapes to the airport. However, Indy and his companions unwittingly board an airplane owned by one of Indy's enemies, from which they have to make an audacious mid-air escape when the real pilots bail out mid-flight! Soon, the intrepid trio find themselves in India, where they come across a village in the grip of starvation. The village children have been kidnapped by local cultists to work in a mine, digging for the sacred Sankara Stones, and Indy is persuaded by the distraught villagers to rescue their youngsters. His quest takes him to the opulent Pankot Palace and, beneath it and beyond a maze of tunnels, the Temple of Doom.\n\nFord is great as Jones, bringing genuine charisma to a role that he was born to play (can you imagine how things would have turned out if Tom Selleck had got the part, as originally planned?) There are some great moments along the way too, including the intentionally subversive opening sequence in Shanghai, a particularly funny and exciting runaway mine-train sequence, and an unforgettable banquet at Pankot Palace in which the food served up is enough to churn any stomach. But Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom still can't live up to the standard set by Raiders of the Lost Ark. As mentioned, Capshaw is a real pain on the senses as the always-squealing heroine, and the plot seems to over-stretch in an effort to link to the next development or set piece. The hunt-for-the-missing-children plot device allows Spielberg to dip into the kind of cloying sentimentality that occasionally mars his films too.

Has good moments but the problematic script turns it in the worst of the series so far","reviewBody":"19 years after a perfect ending to the trilogy, behold, George Lucas, Frank Marshall and Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford come together again to produce Indiana Jones' fourth adventure. This time, the film pays honor to the science fiction films B films of the time. The decision was certainly risky, since almost two decades had passed, having to introduce the character, now older and without the same mobility as before, to a new generation, in addition to having to overcome one of the most acclaimed trilogies of cinema at all times.\n\nThis fourth adventure by the American archaeologist continues to bring good doses of adventure, ingenious scenes and fun to those who follow. In the three Indiana Joness of 1981, 1984 and 1989, the MacGuffins are the treasures: the Ark of the Covenant, the Sankara stones and the Holy Grail, respectively. For the fourth film, Lucas wanted to put ETs in the middle; Ford and Spielberg, not so much. They reached a consensus that it is the translucent skull of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. David Koepp's script follows the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull structure, which is identical to that of Raiders of the Lost Ark: good guys and bad guys fighting for terrain in a race that will only be solved in the final corner. The difference is that in the new cat and mouse game, the Nazis leave and the Soviets enter the full 1950s.\n\nThe script seeks to fill in the gaps left by Connery (who refused to abandon retirement), Elliott (who died in 1992) and John Rhys-Davies (who overcharged) from creating obvious and unimaginative substitutes: the teacher Oxley, which Hurt is forced to interpret distantly, as if in a trance, for almost the entire film; the dean who appears at the head of Jim Broadbent; and the poorly developed assistant experienced by Ray Winstone. Meanwhile, paling in front of the villains of the original films, Cate Blanchett plays the Russian Irina Spalko in an absolutely caricatural way, never sounding threatening and letting her hairstyle, costume and accent do all the work of "composing" the character. On the other hand, it is undeniable that Lucas had a good idea in bringing an impetuous young man as a counterpoint to the aging protagonist, which, in an ideal world, could recapture the wonderful dynamics established by Ford and Connery in "The Last Crusade", oscillating only Indiana's stance towards the frowning side of the spectrum - and, in fact, this effort can be seen in the scene in which Mutt, after a bold move, looks with a proud smile at Indy, who returns a sullen expression (exactly as it had happened so many times in the 89 film). Unfortunately, this dynamic appears only punctually throughout the projection, which prefers to spend more time on the repeated (and only occasionally funny) references to the hero's more advanced age. Likewise, Marion's return is disappointing for not rescuing the explosive chemistry seen in Hunters, since everything here seems just an uninspired imitation of what happened in the original: the couple's fights seem forced, as well as the eventual (and inevitable) romance.\n\nThe irregularity of the script, however, is not only characteristic of the development of the characters. Contrary to what happened in the previous films, the Indiana Jones plot and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not only not interesting, it is also developed in a chaotic way. The plot of the crystal skulls is the worst of the entire series, even surpassing the already claudicating of Sankara stones in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom: you never know what the skulls really are, what they can do, how they came to be here and why there is a need to return them. The story is so absurd that Spielberg, Koepp and Lucas simply have no idea how to end it, culminating in an ending that comes close to catastrophe.\n\nIf before Indy's missions were explained in a simple and objective way, putting the narrative in motion quickly, here the searches and deductions of the heroes take a long time - and the worst: nevertheless, they do not become clearer. Furthermore, although there is an obvious symbolic Catholic aspect in the presence of 13 aliens (Christ and the apostles), the nature of that temple and the objectives of the creatures are never clear. In fact, the fact is that the plot of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is simply bad - and Lucas's insistence on using it is probably the biggest factor responsible for the failure of this new film, since not even Indy's motivations are explained satisfactorily: why, for example, does he insist so much on "returning" the skull as Oxley wishes? And why did Ox, after failing in his first effort to enter the temple, return the artifact to the place where he had found it instead of saving it for later attempts? And why do certain creature (s) act that way at Irina's request? Unfortunately, instead of trying to refine the plot, Koepp tries to disguise the absurdities through ridiculous lines like "They went back to the space between the spaces" (in fact, practically everything that John Hurt has to say in this film hurts his ears).\n\nAnother thing that bothers is the fact that Spielberg sometimes treats the characters as unbeatable. Some of the best scenes in the entire series are forced and exaggerated, like the mine chase in 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' or the classic truck moment in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. These sequences, however, also worked thanks to the reactions of the characters, who were surprised by the facts. In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, they seem to be sure they will never be hurt, resulting in moments that are difficult to swallow like the jump of Marion's jeep. There is a limit to common sense. Despite this, the action sequences mostly work. From the start in the car duel in the desert with Soviet soldiers, going through the whole sequence in the warehouse and in the bizarre ghost town (except the refrigerator scene, of course), the motorcycle chase in college, culminating in the forest race, including the falls in the geographically incorrect Iguazu Falls and the revelation of El Dorado, what we see is pure Indiana Jones, albeit with a Steven Spielberg much less inspired by evoking truly unforgettable moments. Again, he exaggerates like the endless sword fight on top of the cars and the dark "Tarzan moment" with Mutt in the vines, but, in general, the director gets it right by materializing Koepp's ideas in a harmonic set.\n\nHowever, with the exception of a motorcycle chase in the first act, nothing in this project reminds us of brilliant moments like Indy and the Nazi trucks (in Raiders of the Lost Ark), the chase on the underground tracks (in Temple of Perdition) or the tank fight (in The Last Crusade). Yes, there is a long fight over jeeps in the jungle, but the most that Spielberg can create is a beaten mutt gag being hit between the legs by the local vegetation. In addition, the sequence is orchestrated in a confusing, almost chaotic, bordering on laziness when, after the fight comes to an end, new Russian vehicles appear out of nowhere. In the same way, if the joke involving the tree that hits the communist agents hanging from the rock is even funny, it is sad to realize that, soon after, those same henchmen reappear next to Irina, as if nothing had happened. And why does Spielberg insist on showing agile natives hiding in the temple and other ruins if their nature is never explained clearly and they have no effect on the narrative's development?\n\nThe production tried to use the maximum of practical and stunt effects to avoid overuse of computer graphics. Despite using many practical effects, a 2008 production could not very easily evade CGI, and here I have it that Spielberg made a premeditated - and ultimately misunderstood - choice to make computer graphics emulate the effects practical that would have been possible, to a certain extent, in the 1980s, bringing an "old-fashioned" veneer to the film which, I am the first to say, sometimes seems strange. Even with all its problems, however, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull works at least as an exercise in nostalgia: it is pleasurable, as a movie buff, to review the Paramount logo turning into a real version that opens the adventure or accompanies the hero's path through the red line on a map. In addition, Spielberg is adept at rescuing all the language of previous films, from the constant travellings that bring us closer to the characters at dramatically relevant moments to the occasional backlight that marks the (here, only supposed) strength of the villains. Likewise, director of photography Janusz Kaminski does an impeccable job in recreating the style of the now retired Douglas Slocombe, recapturing his preference for shadows and silhouettes, for plans that reveal only the characters' eyes and for the elegant sepia tone that gives the film a classic tone that, even beautiful, does not betray the homage to the B productions made by the series. Not to mention another soundtrack by John Williams. How not to shiver with the Indy theme? Revisiting classics and showing that he is still a master at what he does, this trio - Lucas, Spielberg and Ford - proves that the new doesn't always mean the best. In some cases, luckily, the experience still has a lot to say.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":441534,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2008-05-21","keywords":"area 51,sequel,alien,amazon,colon in title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser trailer: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1622278425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDQ4NzU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwOTk1MQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDQ4NzU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwOTk1MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first trailer for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, directed by Steven Spielberg."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479471/","name":"Shia LaBeouf"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071326/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013175/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000184/","name":"George Lucas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622288/","name":"Jeff Nathanson"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And why did Ox, after failing in his first effort to enter the temple, return the artifact to the place where he had found it instead of saving it for later attempts? And why do certain creature (s) act that way at Irina's request? Unfortunately, instead of trying to refine the plot, Koepp tries to disguise the absurdities through ridiculous lines like "They went back to the space between the spaces" (in fact, practically everything that John Hurt has to say in this film hurts his ears).\n\nAnother thing that bothers is the fact that Spielberg sometimes treats the characters as unbeatable. Some of the best scenes in the entire series are forced and exaggerated, like the mine chase in 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' or the classic truck moment in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. These sequences, however, also worked thanks to the reactions of the characters, who were surprised by the facts. In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, they seem to be sure they will never be hurt, resulting in moments that are difficult to swallow like the jump of Marion's jeep. There is a limit to common sense. Despite this, the action sequences mostly work. From the start in the car duel in the desert with Soviet soldiers, going through the whole sequence in the warehouse and in the bizarre ghost town (except the refrigerator scene, of course), the motorcycle chase in college, culminating in the forest race, including the falls in the geographically incorrect Iguazu Falls and the revelation of El Dorado, what we see is pure Indiana Jones, albeit with a Steven Spielberg much less inspired by evoking truly unforgettable moments. Again, he exaggerates like the endless sword fight on top of the cars and the dark "Tarzan moment" with Mutt in the vines, but, in general, the director gets it right by materializing Koepp's ideas in a harmonic set.\n\nHowever, with the exception of a motorcycle chase in the first act, nothing in this project reminds us of brilliant moments like Indy and the Nazi trucks (in Raiders of the Lost Ark), the chase on the underground tracks (in Temple of Perdition) or the tank fight (in The Last Crusade). Yes, there is a long fight over jeeps in the jungle, but the most that Spielberg can create is a beaten mutt gag being hit between the legs by the local vegetation. In addition, the sequence is orchestrated in a confusing, almost chaotic, bordering on laziness when, after the fight comes to an end, new Russian vehicles appear out of nowhere. In the same way, if the joke involving the tree that hits the communist agents hanging from the rock is even funny, it is sad to realize that, soon after, those same henchmen reappear next to Irina, as if nothing had happened. And why does Spielberg insist on showing agile natives hiding in the temple and other ruins if their nature is never explained clearly and they have no effect on the narrative's development?\n\nThe production tried to use the maximum of practical and stunt effects to avoid overuse of computer graphics. Despite using many practical effects, a 2008 production could not very easily evade CGI, and here I have it that Spielberg made a premeditated - and ultimately misunderstood - choice to make computer graphics emulate the effects practical that would have been possible, to a certain extent, in the 1980s, bringing an "old-fashioned" veneer to the film which, I am the first to say, sometimes seems strange. Even with all its problems, however, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull works at least as an exercise in nostalgia: it is pleasurable, as a movie buff, to review the Paramount logo turning into a real version that opens the adventure or accompanies the hero's path through the red line on a map. In addition, Spielberg is adept at rescuing all the language of previous films, from the constant travellings that bring us closer to the characters at dramatically relevant moments to the occasional backlight that marks the (here, only supposed) strength of the villains. Likewise, director of photography Janusz Kaminski does an impeccable job in recreating the style of the now retired Douglas Slocombe, recapturing his preference for shadows and silhouettes, for plans that reveal only the characters' eyes and for the elegant sepia tone that gives the film a classic tone that, even beautiful, does not betray the homage to the B productions made by the series. Not to mention another soundtrack by John Williams. How not to shiver with the Indy theme? Revisiting classics and showing that he is still a master at what he does, this trio - Lucas, Spielberg and Ford - proves that the new doesn't always mean the best. In some cases, luckily, the experience still has a lot to say.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":441534,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2008-05-21","keywords":"area 51,sequel,alien,amazon,colon in title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser trailer: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1622278425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDQ4NzU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwOTk1MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDQ4NzU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwOTk1MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first trailer for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, directed by Steven Spielberg.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479471/","name":"Shia LaBeouf"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071326/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013175/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000184/","name":"George Lucas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622288/","name":"Jeff Nathanson"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Never before or since have I been in a location where I was surrounded by so much "bling". Storefronts had so many diamonds on display you would think they should be better kept in some European version of Fort Knox.\n\nThe film Blood Diamond puts an entirely new spin on Antwerp, the diamond industry and that pricey stone you might be wearing around your neck, on your ring finger, or in your ears (mine are cubic-Zs). Set in the West African country of Sierra Leone during the 1990s, this historical-adventure-drama covers a time when the country was in turmoil. Warlords, smugglers and the diamond syndicate all play roles in a refugee exodus, and the killing and enslaving of men to work the diamond fields. The title refers to diamonds which are harvested, smuggled and traded to finance the purchase of weapons used in Civil War.\n\nSolomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) stars as a fisherman who has his family torn apart and instead of being killed, is sent to work mining diamonds where he finds and hides a large stone. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) a former mercenary, diamond-smuggler, middleman, you-name-it, is looking to score with that stone and exit the business for good. Writer Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is tired of writing shallow stories about less than newsworthy events; she is looking for information about major players in the diamond trade. They all come together in a fast paced, adventure packed piece of film-making that is brutal at times but never boring. The film has a pleasant, unanticipated ending, something hard to pull off in a film of this kind.\n\nDirector/Producer Edward Zwick is probably the best in Hollywood at taking a big budget feature film with a historical theme and carefully relay a message without lecturing his audience. His earlier works include a story of the first all-black U.S. Civil War company in "Glory" a film, which resulted in Denzel Washington winning his first Oscar. Zwick takes credit for works like The Last Samurai, Shakespeare in Love, Traffic and Courage Under Fire. He is second to no one when it comes to balancing a historical event with action-drama entertainment. Edward Zwick is one of few L.A. directors who still works within the Hollywood establishment yet is able to put out good quality film. \n\nCheck out Blood Diamond, your "bling" may never look the same again.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":526088,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-01-31","keywords":"civil war,diamond,rebel,sierra leone,journalist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blood Diamond","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi180027673","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4ZTNiYzMtMjYzYy00YTg4LWIxMDYtZmQ1NDE1M2ZjNjIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4ZTNiYzMtMjYzYy00YTg4LWIxMDYtZmQ1NDE1M2ZjNjIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005023/","name":"Djimon Hounsou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000124/","name":"Jennifer Connelly"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001880/","name":"Edward Zwick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0167271/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0114242/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0495378/","name":"Charles Leavitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2057149/","name":"C.

FBI agent Carl becomes obsessed with tracking down the con man, who only revels in the pursuit.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0264464/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"bob the moo","dateCreated":"2003-12-25","inLanguage":"English","name":"Slick and enjoyable story telling","reviewBody":"When his parents file for divorce and he has to chose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jnr runs away from home.  He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each ruse.  Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques.  As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse.\n\nBased on a true story, although it doesn't rely on `and it really happened' to be a good film - although that this guy could even do half of this stuff is impressive, this film is a slick bit of entertainment even if it left me feeling a little bit like it was too much presentation.  The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale.  It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to.  It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly.\n\nThe presentation is good.  Williams' score is not as memorable as his usual work but it is what the film needs it to be - unobtrusive and slick.  Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period.  The only downside of this slickness is that it feels like eating a sweet - it is very nice while it lasts but it doesn't fill you up. I enjoyed the film but it did leave me wondering what else there was; even if I did still have a sugary taste in my mouth.  But to be fair - this is a minor compliant as the film didn't set out to be some massive thought provoking film; it was a chase movie and it was a very stylish and enjoyable one at that.\n\nThe cast is good even if they aren't all used well.  If anyone can tell me why Jennifer Garner even bothered to show up I'll be happy to listen. DiCaprio is very good. I'm not a massive fan of his but he was engaging here and looked about the right age to play the part - sort of between man and boy.  Hanks does good work in support. Because his character is quite drab it is easy to forget him but I really enjoyed him and thought he brought more to the film than DiCaprio.  Walken is good in support and Sheen adds another famous name to the end credits but it is very much a two hander with Hanks and DiCaprio more than able.\n\nOverall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is slightly more enjoyable for being a true story.  If anything it is a little too slick for it's own good, but that is a petty complaint to make against a film that kept me pleasingly entertained for the past two hours!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":907490,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"impostor,con,race against time,deception,mother son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Catch Me If You Can","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1220346137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxM2UxZTUtMzFlZS00YTVjLWFkNzctZjQzZjMwN2ZlNTllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxM2UxZTUtMzFlZS00YTVjLWFkNzctZjQzZjMwN2ZlNTllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Dreamworks","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000686/","name":"Christopher Walken"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0084134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0112912/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622288/","name":"Jeff Nathanson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007646/","name":"Frank Abagnale Jr.","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1127221/","name":"Stan Redding"],"duration":"PT2H21M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Never before or since have I been in a location where I was surrounded by so much "bling". Storefronts had so many diamonds on display you would think they should be better kept in some European version of Fort Knox.\n\nThe film Blood Diamond puts an entirely new spin on Antwerp, the diamond industry and that pricey stone you might be wearing around your neck, on your ring finger, or in your ears (mine are cubic-Zs). Set in the West African country of Sierra Leone during the 1990s, this historical-adventure-drama covers a time when the country was in turmoil. Warlords, smugglers and the diamond syndicate all play roles in a refugee exodus, and the killing and enslaving of men to work the diamond fields. The title refers to diamonds which are harvested, smuggled and traded to finance the purchase of weapons used in Civil War.\n\nSolomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) stars as a fisherman who has his family torn apart and instead of being killed, is sent to work mining diamonds where he finds and hides a large stone. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) a former mercenary, diamond-smuggler, middleman, you-name-it, is looking to score with that stone and exit the business for good. Writer Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is tired of writing shallow stories about less than newsworthy events; she is looking for information about major players in the diamond trade. They all come together in a fast paced, adventure packed piece of film-making that is brutal at times but never boring. The film has a pleasant, unanticipated ending, something hard to pull off in a film of this kind.\n\nDirector/Producer Edward Zwick is probably the best in Hollywood at taking a big budget feature film with a historical theme and carefully relay a message without lecturing his audience. His earlier works include a story of the first all-black U.S. Civil War company in "Glory" a film, which resulted in Denzel Washington winning his first Oscar. Zwick takes credit for works like The Last Samurai, Shakespeare in Love, Traffic and Courage Under Fire. He is second to no one when it comes to balancing a historical event with action-drama entertainment. Edward Zwick is one of few L.A. directors who still works within the Hollywood establishment yet is able to put out good quality film. \n\nCheck out Blood Diamond, your "bling" may never look the same again.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":526088,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-01-31","keywords":"civil war,diamond,rebel,sierra leone,journalist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blood Diamond","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi180027673","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4ZTNiYzMtMjYzYy00YTg4LWIxMDYtZmQ1NDE1M2ZjNjIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4ZTNiYzMtMjYzYy00YTg4LWIxMDYtZmQ1NDE1M2ZjNjIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005023/","name":"Djimon Hounsou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000124/","name":"Jennifer Connelly"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001880/","name":"Edward Zwick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0167271/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0114242/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0495378/","name":"Charles Leavitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2057149/","name":"C.

However, once they realize they weren't picked to succeed but chosen for their patent culpability when they inevitably fail, will the Suicide Squad resolve to die trying, or decide it's every man for himself?","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001467/","name":"Jared Leto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043742/","name":"David Ayer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028338/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043742/","name":"David Ayer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1694619/","name":"John Ostrander"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Taking place 3 years after the original, this film did have some high expectations to live up too. The humour as well as the strong female characters involved created something with little to complain about. Sexist jokes such as 'Woman are about as good at a coppella as they are at being doctors' said by John (John Michael Higgins) to then be put down by such comments like 'crack a Book, John' said by Gail (Elizabeth Banks), is displaying woman power. The film did a good job at not living up to the hype, with many critics dubbing the film to be better than the first. But like we all know, films with hype generally don't live up to expectations, turning a film from a success to a shamble in weeks. Thanks to many of the original cast reigniting their roles in this film, it meant for a quick and easy introduction, with all the characters already built and back stories set. \n\nBeca (Anna Kendrick) has worked her way up from the first film, with her natural and powerful singing ability; we see her rise from the new comer in the original to the leader in Pitch Perfect 2. We see her leadership and her desire to achieving her real goal in life, whilst being the figurehead for all of the other girls to follow. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) has recreated her role from the original in a much more humorous and creative way, being the main supplier of laughs throughout the film, from her sexual antics to her denial of love she is always throwing laughs at us, giving us the feeling of 'I wish she was my friend'. Jason Moore didn't continue his role as director in the sequel, leaving the job to Elizabeth Bank to direct and act in this hilarious sequel. Although during the end performance, there is obvious and silly CGI green screens that even the least of film nerds would be able to reorganise, granted this isn't just down to the director, but the lack of a 'Perfect' special effect expert. However you can't take away the excellent choreography and excellent screen direction that she produced, with the breath taking dancing and the powerful voices, you are fully entertained throughout each performance, if it's the plot changing performance or if its when Amy decides to serenade the man of her dreams. The film doesn't change much from the first film, with a similar plot line and the use of the same scenes during the film, like the group showdown where they have to blurt out songs without compromise for them to lose only too their main competition, showing the lack of creativity by the writers.\n\nBeca and Fat Amy both stealing the stage with their support acts Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Lilly (Hana Mea Lee) not far behind left little room for the new characters to grow, leaving characters such as Flo (Chrissie Fit) as a nameless character that you just remember as 'The New One'. Down too the fact that she wasn't a very fun character and didn't have the personality to out shines the outrageous Amy. \n\nPitch Perfect 2 starts 3 years after the original, meaning that many of the girls are in their final year of college. However Chloe (Brittany Snow) who was one of the main Barden Bella's in the first had actually been at college for 7 years, without no thought of what she was going to do after and knowing what she was even doing at college. This was a plot hole in the film that overall didn't have many, however the nature of her role in the film, you get past the fact that she is a bit of a sado who doesn't want to leave her life and go into real world.\n\nThe performances put on by the Barden Bella's where much better in this one, but it had to be because the competition was a lot better, although the plot was similar but on a larger level it still gave us lots of laughs throughout, weather it help the story or didn't. The story wasn't very strong and you could tell that the ideas where lacking throughout the film. You could always tell that they were going to bring out an amazing performance to try achieving their goal, making the film lack in excitement and emotion.\n\nWhere the film lacks in plot it makes up in humour, giving you laughs throughout the whole film, with there wacky yet clever jokes. The film has not moved on much from the original with the plot being basically the without the build-up to allow characters to grow. Although it has some flaws that with more creative writers could have been avoided, it is still a good watch to have a laugh with friends.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":150854,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Music"],"datePublished":"2015-05-15","keywords":"f rated,sequel,a cappella,reference to philippines,triple f rated","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Global Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1579003417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc2ODI0MjA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE0MTE0NDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc2ODI0MjA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE0MTE0NDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After getting suspended from the ICCAs, the Barden Bellas must win the World Championships -- an international competition that no American team has ever won -- in order to be reinstated.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0447695/","name":"Anna Kendrick"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2313103/","name":"Rebel Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2794962/","name":"Hailee Steinfeld"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006969/","name":"Elizabeth Banks"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283926/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0134224/","name":"Kay Cannon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3015467/","name":"Mickey Rapkin"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There were pretty funny scenes when they surprised Dave in the beginning and a hilarious one when their manager, Ian (David Cross), gave each of them a caffeinated iced drink to give them energy. Other than that, this was a mostly by-the-numbers story of the pressures of success and the toll it takes on your health. In fact, the climatic scene when the rodent music group is revealed to be lip-syncing to their own vocals (because of their now-hoarse voices) seems aimed at those who go for such acts like Britney Spears and Ashlee Simpson instead of real musicians who play genuine music (though I don't consider what David Seville-Jason Lee-had auditioned initially for Ian authentic either). It's obvious that Lee ("My Name Is Earl") and Cross ("Arrested Development") took these roles for a large paycheck though Lee, at least, grows on you after a while. The music performances of the Chipmunks themselves are variable depending on whether you like any of the songs they sing here or the way their voices completely dominate though I admit liking their performance of "Only You", "Funkytown", and, of course, "The Chipmunk Song", and even the updated version of "Witch Doctor" (though I prefer the original recordings). Not bad for a reboot though for my money, I think I'd love to see the original version for television from the '50s, "The Alvin Show". P.S. What a treat to see the original album covers of The Chipmunks over the years during the end credits.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82022,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-01-09","keywords":"concert,talking animal,new york city,chipmunk,singing animal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Alvin and the Chipmunks","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi984744217","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0OTIxNjQ3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYwODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0OTIxNjQ3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYwODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Alvin and the Chipmunks Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005134/","name":"Jason Lee"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046559/","name":"Ross Bagdasarian Jr."},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439739/","name":"Janice Karman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384722/","name":"Tim Hill"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026227/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900140/","name":"Jon Vitti"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0574509/","name":"Will McRobb"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0899531/","name":"Chris Viscardi"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Other than that, this was a mostly by-the-numbers story of the pressures of success and the toll it takes on your health. In fact, the climatic scene when the rodent music group is revealed to be lip-syncing to their own vocals (because of their now-hoarse voices) seems aimed at those who go for such acts like Britney Spears and Ashlee Simpson instead of real musicians who play genuine music (though I don't consider what David Seville-Jason Lee-had auditioned initially for Ian authentic either). It's obvious that Lee ("My Name Is Earl") and Cross ("Arrested Development") took these roles for a large paycheck though Lee, at least, grows on you after a while. The music performances of the Chipmunks themselves are variable depending on whether you like any of the songs they sing here or the way their voices completely dominate though I admit liking their performance of "Only You", "Funkytown", and, of course, "The Chipmunk Song", and even the updated version of "Witch Doctor" (though I prefer the original recordings). Not bad for a reboot though for my money, I think I'd love to see the original version for television from the '50s, "The Alvin Show". P.S. What a treat to see the original album covers of The Chipmunks over the years during the end credits.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82022,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-01-09","keywords":"concert,talking animal,new york city,chipmunk,singing animal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Alvin and the Chipmunks","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi984744217","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0OTIxNjQ3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYwODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0OTIxNjQ3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYwODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Alvin and the Chipmunks Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005134/","name":"Jason Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046559/","name":"Ross Bagdasarian Jr.","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439739/","name":"Janice Karman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384722/","name":"Tim Hill"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026227/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900140/","name":"Jon Vitti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0574509/","name":"Will McRobb","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0899531/","name":"Chris Viscardi"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Taking place 3 years after the original, this film did have some high expectations to live up too. The humour as well as the strong female characters involved created something with little to complain about. Sexist jokes such as 'Woman are about as good at a coppella as they are at being doctors' said by John (John Michael Higgins) to then be put down by such comments like 'crack a Book, John' said by Gail (Elizabeth Banks), is displaying woman power. The film did a good job at not living up to the hype, with many critics dubbing the film to be better than the first. But like we all know, films with hype generally don't live up to expectations, turning a film from a success to a shamble in weeks. Thanks to many of the original cast reigniting their roles in this film, it meant for a quick and easy introduction, with all the characters already built and back stories set. \n\nBeca (Anna Kendrick) has worked her way up from the first film, with her natural and powerful singing ability; we see her rise from the new comer in the original to the leader in Pitch Perfect 2. We see her leadership and her desire to achieving her real goal in life, whilst being the figurehead for all of the other girls to follow. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) has recreated her role from the original in a much more humorous and creative way, being the main supplier of laughs throughout the film, from her sexual antics to her denial of love she is always throwing laughs at us, giving us the feeling of 'I wish she was my friend'. Jason Moore didn't continue his role as director in the sequel, leaving the job to Elizabeth Bank to direct and act in this hilarious sequel. Although during the end performance, there is obvious and silly CGI green screens that even the least of film nerds would be able to reorganise, granted this isn't just down to the director, but the lack of a 'Perfect' special effect expert. However you can't take away the excellent choreography and excellent screen direction that she produced, with the breath taking dancing and the powerful voices, you are fully entertained throughout each performance, if it's the plot changing performance or if its when Amy decides to serenade the man of her dreams. The film doesn't change much from the first film, with a similar plot line and the use of the same scenes during the film, like the group showdown where they have to blurt out songs without compromise for them to lose only too their main competition, showing the lack of creativity by the writers.\n\nBeca and Fat Amy both stealing the stage with their support acts Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Lilly (Hana Mea Lee) not far behind left little room for the new characters to grow, leaving characters such as Flo (Chrissie Fit) as a nameless character that you just remember as 'The New One'. Down too the fact that she wasn't a very fun character and didn't have the personality to out shines the outrageous Amy. \n\nPitch Perfect 2 starts 3 years after the original, meaning that many of the girls are in their final year of college. However Chloe (Brittany Snow) who was one of the main Barden Bella's in the first had actually been at college for 7 years, without no thought of what she was going to do after and knowing what she was even doing at college. This was a plot hole in the film that overall didn't have many, however the nature of her role in the film, you get past the fact that she is a bit of a sado who doesn't want to leave her life and go into real world.\n\nThe performances put on by the Barden Bella's where much better in this one, but it had to be because the competition was a lot better, although the plot was similar but on a larger level it still gave us lots of laughs throughout, weather it help the story or didn't. The story wasn't very strong and you could tell that the ideas where lacking throughout the film. You could always tell that they were going to bring out an amazing performance to try achieving their goal, making the film lack in excitement and emotion.\n\nWhere the film lacks in plot it makes up in humour, giving you laughs throughout the whole film, with there wacky yet clever jokes. The film has not moved on much from the original with the plot being basically the without the build-up to allow characters to grow. Although it has some flaws that with more creative writers could have been avoided, it is still a good watch to have a laugh with friends.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":150854,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Music"],"datePublished":"2015-05-15","keywords":"f rated,sequel,a cappella,reference to philippines,triple f rated","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Global Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1579003417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc2ODI0MjA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE0MTE0NDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc2ODI0MjA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE0MTE0NDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After getting suspended from the ICCAs, the Barden Bellas must win the World Championships -- an international competition that no American team has ever won -- in order to be reinstated.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0447695/","name":"Anna Kendrick"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2313103/","name":"Rebel Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2794962/","name":"Hailee Steinfeld"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006969/","name":"Elizabeth Banks"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283926/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0134224/","name":"Kay Cannon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3015467/","name":"Mickey Rapkin"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Because there was a lot to like in this movie. I like Mark Wahlberg. I like the bear. I like Amanda Seyfried. And there were a lot of good laughs in this movie. Good one-liners, and good recurring gags.\n\nHowever, it just wasn't enough to make up for a horrible plot. The plot is lifted from "Miracle on 43rd Street." But it is not Christmas, Ted is not Santa. Somehow Ted does not rise to the mythical level of Santa, this is not a movie for kids. and the movie falls flat. Markie Mark is same as ever, and I do enjoy him. Kudos to Amanda Seyfried, who tries so hard to make the romance story line work. But I could never get past the fact that I was watching MW and AS and a wise-cracking stuffed bear. Some good laughs? Yes. A good story? Not even close.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":197666,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-26","keywords":"lawyer,fight,scene after end credits,trial,talking teddy bear","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Theaters June 26","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2232528921","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzNjM5NjE2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU3MTc5NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzNjM5NjE2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU3MTc5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Ted 2, newlywed couple Ted and Tami-Lynn want to have a baby, but in order to qualify to be a parent, Ted will have to prove he's a person in a court of law.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532235/","name":"Seth MacFarlane","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1086543/","name":"Amanda Seyfried"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532235/","name":"Seth MacFarlane"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0194736/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065872/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532235/","name":"Seth MacFarlane","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273148/","name":"Alec Sulkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273397/","name":"Wellesley Wild"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Furthermore, it was the first Japanese film to win the Palme D'Or at Cannes. 7/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3556,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History"],"datePublished":"1953-10-31","keywords":"medieval times,japan,stalker,koto,murder","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477553/","name":"Machiko Kyô","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367928/","name":"Kazuo Hasegawa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0945299/","name":"Isao Yamagata"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0455938/","name":"Teinosuke Kinugasa"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067278/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452840/","name":"Kan Kikuchi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0455938/","name":"Teinosuke Kinugasa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619211/","name":"Masaichi Nagata"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The film is not limited to the perspective of the protagonist, and alternates between the moral dilemmas of each of the characters in fulfilling predetermined Soviet agendas in the formation of a communist Poland. \n\nThe visual composition of the film is as masterful as the complexity of the characters and plot.

The frames are longer shots in general, and forced schematization through editing is all but absent. The precise composition of each scene throughout the film provides the visual coherency that would otherwise be imposed by careful editing; as an example, see the scene in which Maciek is underneath the staircase in the lobby of the hotel towards the end of the film, or the final "Polish" dance scene. \n\nI would highly recommend some research into the political transitions of Poland in the years directly following WWI before viewing this film for the first time; this film was made for a particular audience who clearly understood certain cultural and historical references that a modern Western audience will inevitably miss (ie. "Were you in Warsaw?"). The thematic and emotional complexity of the film is also enhanced by an understanding of Polish history.

Diamonds are cold, hard, many faceted and beautiful. Catherine Deneuve is the star here.  I rest my case.  There is, of course, more to it than that but not a lot more.  It's French so it's stylish by definition but Nicole Garcia, like so many French actors/writers/directors, was born in Oran, Algeria - gateway to Lisbon and, by definition, a free world, as we learned in the first reel of 'Casablanca' - so there's also something of the outsider element, the shopgirl who came to the ball because her beauty captured the heart of the Second Son, and who feels always slightly uneasy that it all may end tomorrow.  So, what do we get for our money?  Style, opulence, quasi-noir, great acting.  Is that enough?

Diamonds are cold, hard, many faceted and beautiful. Catherine Deneuve is the star here.  I rest my case.  There is, of course, more to it than that but not a lot more.  It's French so it's stylish by definition but Nicole Garcia, like so many French actors/writers/directors, was born in Oran, Algeria - gateway to Lisbon and, by definition, a free world, as we learned in the first reel of 'Casablanca' - so there's also something of the outsider element, the shopgirl who came to the ball because her beauty captured the heart of the Second Son, and who feels always slightly uneasy that it all may end tomorrow.  So, what do we get for our money?  Style, opulence, quasi-noir, great acting.  Is that enough?  You tell me. 7/10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2259,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1998-10-07","keywords":"drunkenness,flashback,betrayal,personal recovery,generational conflict","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Place Vendome","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1219428633","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA4ZDBhNTQtNTljNS00ODg2LTg5ZDQtYjJiYWUxY2Q4NjhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA4ZDBhNTQtNTljNS00ODg2LTg5ZDQtYjJiYWUxY2Q4NjhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Wellspring","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000366/","name":"Catherine Deneuve","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0045870/","name":"Jean-Pierre Bacri","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0782561/","name":"Emmanuelle Seigner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305368/","name":"Nicole Garcia"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022244/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075023/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276466/","name":"Jacques Fieschi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305368/","name":"Nicole Garcia"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is a horror film with good production values and Ms. Kuriyama plays Yuko very well, very likable and sensible. If you like horror, especially J horror, you will like this film.

This is a horror film with good production values and Ms. Kuriyama plays Yuko very well, very likable and sensible. If you like horror, especially J horror, you will like this film. While horror is not my favorite genre, I enjoyed this, it moved along well, never dragged and you care about Yuko and Mami. Thats enough of a ringing endorsement, and the film succeeds on many levels.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3001,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2007-02-17","keywords":"crying,deviant,tear,customer,stylist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0475752/","name":"Chiaki Kuriyama","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1935082/","name":"Megumi Satô","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0875261/","name":"Tsugumi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814469/","name":"Sion Sono","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1372679/","name":"Joe DiGiorgi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1002867/","name":"Tony Salerno"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073744/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0122174/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814469/","name":"Sion Sono","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1329999/","name":"Masaki Adachi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2776563/","name":"Makoto Sanada"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Most of it is probably due to a pretty good cast - Brando is excellent, and Duvall, Dickinson, and E.G.Marshall put in good work. Redford's part is too small to do much with. I too was astounded at James Fox's pretty darn good Southern accent; it was so good that at first I couldn't place him, and then all those British roles came back to me in surprise. The script is ok too, and one would like to know more about the backstage fighting that went on over it between Hellman &amp; company. The Panavision color is excellent; far better than what we have today. The portrayal of small-town bigotry, duplicity, jealousy, betrayal, and infidelity is well-done, and the spectacular junkyard Gotterdamerung is a chilling finale. The flick is definitely worth seeing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11518,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1966-02-18","keywords":"manhunt,escaped convict,racism,woman in love with two men,southern u.s.","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi403684889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGM1YjJmNDctYjViYi00MjY5LWFlODUtY2Y0MDgxMDgxZDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGM1YjJmNDctYjViYi00MjY5LWFlODUtY2Y0MDgxMDgxZDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000008/","name":"Marlon Brando"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000404/","name":"Jane Fonda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000602/","name":"Robert Redford"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0671957/","name":"Arthur Penn"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0218910/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285210/","name":"Horton Foote"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0375484/","name":"Lillian Hellman"}],"duration":"PT2H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Most of it is probably due to a pretty good cast - Brando is excellent, and Duvall, Dickinson, and E.G.Marshall put in good work. Redford's part is too small to do much with. I too was astounded at James Fox's pretty darn good Southern accent; it was so good that at first I couldn't place him, and then all those British roles came back to me in surprise. The script is ok too, and one would like to know more about the backstage fighting that went on over it between Hellman &amp; company. The Panavision color is excellent; far better than what we have today. The portrayal of small-town bigotry, duplicity, jealousy, betrayal, and infidelity is well-done, and the spectacular junkyard Gotterdamerung is a chilling finale. The flick is definitely worth seeing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11518,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1966-02-18","keywords":"manhunt,escaped convict,racism,woman in love with two men,southern u.s.","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi403684889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGM1YjJmNDctYjViYi00MjY5LWFlODUtY2Y0MDgxMDgxZDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGM1YjJmNDctYjViYi00MjY5LWFlODUtY2Y0MDgxMDgxZDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000008/","name":"Marlon Brando","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000404/","name":"Jane Fonda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000602/","name":"Robert Redford"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0671957/","name":"Arthur Penn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0218910/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285210/","name":"Horton Foote","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0375484/","name":"Lillian Hellman"],"duration":"PT2H14M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Used to a diet of direct-to-drive-in films they had no conception of what could happen when Hollywood threw big bucks and a competent (if distracted) director at the genre. What they got was something that movie historians are still trying to classify. A movie based on a CB radio song that morphed into a poetic homage to machinery; where trucks are turned into mythological monsters and filmed cruising through the heat-radiating desert to a score of classical music.\n\nWhy Sam Peckinpah elected to take on this project has really never been explained, although that decision certainly supports those tales of substance abuse, and the final cut is bizarre enough to also fit that explanation. It is an amazing film as it wobbles between self-parody and self-importance to a degree never seen before and never seen again until "Apocalypse Now". I'm not sure how much attention and interest Peckinpah actually showed toward the making of "Convoy". It has the disjointed feel of multiple directors or of a Director of Photography filling in many times when Sam was not motivated to make an appearance on the set.\n\nKris Kristofferson is fine as trucker "Rubber Duck" although Earnest Borgnine pretty much steals the whole thing.\n\nBut "Convoy's real claim to fame is as the film where Ali MacGraw's career spectacularly crashed and burned. She did not just fade away but shattered into a million pieces. MacGraw got into acting in her late twenties but looked young enough to be believable as a college-age girl in her first two starring roles; the excellent "Goodbye Columbus" and the pathetic but hugely popular "Love Story". Her age worked to her advantage as her two characters (particularly "Goodbye's" Brenda) came off as poised, stylish, classy and smart. She picked up a huge following of male viewers who would have bought tickets to anything she was in and she was generally inoffensive to female viewers. She was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar, started fashion crazes, and made the cover of Time magazine. She also picked up the head of Paramount Studios (Robert Evans) as a husband dedicated to advancing her acting career. It was a done deal that she would get the lead in "Chinatown", a role that would fit her rather limited range (poised, classy, stylish). Her only obstacle was managing the transition to middle age in a way that her smitten fans could accept.\n\nUnfortunately she dumped Evans for a short marriage (5 years) to Steve McQueen. Just how badly her image and career were managed after she left Evans is illustrated by her bad haircut in "Convoy". Just glance at the promotional poster and you may be able to hear the sounds of a million bubbles bursting in the minds of her male fans. The idea of "Brenda" playing a truck stop mama with short curly hair would have made it too painful to even contemplate seeing this movie. Her fan base literally melted away with the start of the film's promotion campaign. They never returned, the illusion had died. Ironically had they actually seen her horrible performance in "Convoy" they might have felt better, as the performance is so absurd it achieves a sort of surreal quality.

Or a fist of memories.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":242,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1976-09-29","keywords":"heroine,smuggling,coup,chimpanzee,underwear","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0312575/","name":"Giuliano Gemma","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000266/","name":"Ursula Andress","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001588/","name":"Jack Palance"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0856319/","name":"Duccio Tessari"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147178/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002614/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024589/","name":"Mario Amendola","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166405/","name":"Gianfranco Clerici","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179278/","name":"Bruno Corbucci"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

She was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar, started fashion crazes, and made the cover of Time magazine. She also picked up the head of Paramount Studios (Robert Evans) as a husband dedicated to advancing her acting career.

S. Marine rifle company led by a man named "Sergeant John M. Stryker" (John Wayne). As it so happens, having experienced combat firsthand he is extremely determined to train and fine-tune his company into being as capable and ready as possible. Needless to say, his hardline approach is not welcomed by everyone in the company with one particular person named "Al Thomas" (Forrest Tucker) having had a personal quarrel with him in a previous assignment. Additionally, another man by the name of "Robert Dunne" (Arthur Franz) also has a dislike for him but for an entirely different reason. Yet even so, Sgt Stryker realizes that he cannot let their personal animosity deter him from his mission-especially since they are bound to see ferocious combat in the very near future.

As it so happens, having experienced combat firsthand he is extremely determined to train and fine-tune his company into being as capable and ready as possible. Needless to say, his hardline approach is not welcomed by everyone in the company with one particular person named "Al Thomas" (Forrest Tucker) having had a personal quarrel with him in a previous assignment. Additionally, another man by the name of "Robert Dunne" (Arthur Franz) also has a dislike for him but for an entirely different reason. Yet even so, Sgt Stryker realizes that he cannot let their personal animosity deter him from his mission-especially since they are bound to see ferocious combat in the very near future.

The primary concern, the very first problem, is always to decide what the relationships are among the audience, the camera, the narrator if any, and the characters.\n\nWoody was on his way to making a murder mystery, which is the purest form of messing about with these relationships. In a much studied decision, they decided to cut out all the mystery and just focus on the context. In this case, that context is a richly layered evocation of a relationship. I really wish I could see the original film to discover the mysteries Woody intended to hide in the folds.\n\nAnd the folds are as numerous and complex as they can get. We have a framing device where Woody speaks to us partly as a conversation which blends into a standup, which is mirrored as a part of the story. We have timeshifting where we move back and forth in time in a simple 'Tarantino' way; but we go way past: characters from the 'present' enter the past as Dickensian ghosts, then they talk to characters in the past. we have characters in different pasts talking to each other via split screen. We have a layering of Woody and Diane's relationship in real life, then the film, then TWO films within: a play which is part of the action and a cartoon which is the action itself.\n\nMore: we have Woody talking to the audience as if we were shifted into the play -- early in that play we are introduced to Bergman and Fellini: in both cases while they are waiting outside. These are the two inventors of folded narrative. Even more: while some bozo perfessor spouts off about Fellini and McLuhan, Woody enlists the audience to challenge him and drags out McLuhan himself! The joke of course is that McLuhan himself was a vapid weaver of lowbrow theories.\n\nAnd more and more with the constant weaving of 'analysis' and other film-like activities: singers, photographers, TeeVee stars, models...\n\nThis period was when he was first exposed to Wallace Shawn who was hanging out with Terrence Malick, two other innovators in narrative folding. All the 'New Yorker' stuff means more when you know Shawn's father was the long-time editor of that publication and defined the self-absorbed reflection that characterizes the city and this film.\n\nKeaton's manner was essential to pulling this off, someone who could pull off the story about her uncle dying while waiting for a Turkey. Watch her.. she is clued in to simultaneously being in herself (Keaton), herself (Hall), inside the story she is telling and inside the story Woody is telling. She shifts and guffaws just as if she were stoned and moving among realities, just as her character.\n\nJust amazing and intelligent. Will we ever see this the way it was written and shot?

All the 'New Yorker' stuff means more when you know Shawn's father was the long-time editor of that publication and defined the self-absorbed reflection that characterizes the city and this film.\n\nKeaton's manner was essential to pulling this off, someone who could pull off the story about her uncle dying while waiting for a Turkey. Watch her.. she is clued in to simultaneously being in herself (Keaton), herself (Hall), inside the story she is telling and inside the story Woody is telling. She shifts and guffaws just as if she were stoned and moving among realities, just as her character.\n\nJust amazing and intelligent. Will we ever see this the way it was written and shot? Or is that mystery too intelligent for us, who prefer to think of this as a funny, endearing love story.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":259916,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1977-04-20","keywords":"breaking the fourth wall,neurosis,character name in title,jew,long take","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"'Emperor' Star Kat Graham Was Inspired by This Hollywood Icon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2610150937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDlkZTM1MDktYzk1Yy00MjIxLWEwODctMzk2MWZkMjRiNjU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDlkZTM1MDktYzk1Yy00MjIxLWEwODctMzk2MWZkMjRiNjU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"'Emperor' star Kat Graham has seen this movie more than any other, would love to see this show's cast turn into vampires, and was inspired by this iconic Hollywood actress.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000095/","name":"Woody Allen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000473/","name":"Diane Keaton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0731634/","name":"Tony Roberts"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000095/","name":"Woody Allen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008432/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0100349/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000095/","name":"Woody Allen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0108613/","name":"Marshall Brickman"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Kubrick wanted total administrative as well as artistic authority over the making of the film about a revolt of gladiators and slaves in ancient Rome.\n\nBut you will notice that Bryna Productions not only financed SPARTACUS but also an earlier film directed by Kubrick, PATHS OF GLORY (1958). Bryna was Kirk Douglas' film company and, as most filmgoers know, he was the star of both films. Besides having all the money to make the films, Douglas had artistic vision as well. Only three weeks into what would prove to be an incredibly complex and arduous production, Douglas fired venerable director Anthony Mann (RAW DEAL, RAILROADED,THE FURIES, THE NAKED SPUR, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, MAN OF THE WEST, etc.) from SPARTACUS. With only two days notice, Kubrick was hired to replace him.\n\nShooting PATHS OF GLORY, Douglas had confined his criticisms and objections to Kubrick's failed rewriting of the script (they went with the original screenplay). Douglas' complaints and artistic influence were far greater on SPARTACUS, much to Kubrick's chagrin. Though the director craved autonomy over every aspect of the film, Douglas would not budge. A tense compromise was reached but ultimately Douglas had the last word. Kubrick saw himself as just a hired gun. And he would never allow himself to be placed in this position again.\n\nLater, both men would complain about the film's outcome and each other. They never made another movie together. \n\nBut SPARTACUS is no uneven patchwork of divergent ideas. The film is cohesive and arresting. At the restored version of three hours and eighteen minutes, there is practically no dead footage in the film. Dalton Trumbo's screenplay is surprisingly economical, with sharply drawn characters placed against the sweeping historical majesty and violent sociological tumult of ancient Rome. Quite plainly, the gloriously inventive music by Alex North is among the greatest scores ever written for a motion picture. And despite Kubrick's bad experience, he managed to guide the actors towards creating outstanding work (a best supporting actor Oscar for Peter Ustinov). He even transformed the very real enmity between Laughton and Olivier into an on-screen asset. His other contributions were considerable also (the large scale and power of the battle sequence, for example). In the end, for the film at least, the clash of giant egos proved fortuitous. Recommendations: for greater insight and detail on this and Kubrick's other films I urge you to seek out Jan Harlan's excellent documentary, STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES, and Vincent LoBrutto's exhaustive, highly informative biography, STANLEY KUBRICK. For the producer's views on SPARTACUS and its director, take a gander at Kirk Douglas' very candid autobiography, THE RAGMAN'S SON.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":131237,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"1960-11-17","keywords":"gladiator,slave rebellion,roman republic,roman empire,slave revolt","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1415363353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDljYjRlOWEtNzgxYS00M2JiLTkxNmEtYzNkOTI0Y2RkMGEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDljYjRlOWEtNzgxYS00M2JiLTkxNmEtYzNkOTI0Y2RkMGEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000018/","name":"Kirk Douglas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000059/","name":"Laurence Olivier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001739/","name":"Jean Simmons"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000040/","name":"Stanley Kubrick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068126/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874308/","name":"Dalton Trumbo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268779/","name":"Howard Fast"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001811/","name":"Peter Ustinov"}],"duration":"PT3H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His portrayal of mob boss Whitey Bulger is a powerhouse performance and easily his best since he first introduced the world to Jack Sparrow. It's too bad the movie as a whole doesn't fair quite as well. Despite a great cast and some interestingly insane source material, somehow a movie about one of America's most infamous criminals feels more like small claims court. Director Cooper focuses his narrative on Bulger's less-than-legal partnership with the FBI. It's a fascinatingly close-knit community we witness (agents, felons, politicians, and families alike) in which loyalty and corruption go hand-in-hand. It's a grimy yet quiet 70's-feel gangster film that engages its audience nearly as much as it reminds them of better films. Therein lies its big problem: What is Black Mass offering that hasn't already been perfected in other gangster films? Unfortunately, instead of a true movie-making vision, it's like a guy watched every crime drama from the last 40 years and just spit out a less-interesting copycat. Not that a counterfeit of something great can't still have its positives: the score is beautiful and the performances from the top-notch cast around Depp are nearly as superb as his, all of whom nail the oft-parodied Bostonian accent with aplomb. But with too many side plots to juggle, not enough cohesion to the storytelling, and an unfortunate lack of auteur vision, Black Mass just can't stand against the great American crime films of yore (Chinatown, Godfather, Goodfellas).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":175214,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-09-18","keywords":"true crime,fbi agent,gangster,boston massachusetts,based on true story","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3616256793","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzNzA1OTYyNjJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDIzMzIxNDYx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzNzA1OTYyNjJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDIzMzIxNDYx._V1_.jpg","description":"The true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212722/","name":"Benedict Cumberbatch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424848/","name":"Dakota Johnson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0178376/","name":"Scott Cooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0285648/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0449458/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0307345/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3286851/","name":"Mark Mallouk"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125336/","name":"Jez Butterworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3251662/","name":"Dick Lehr"}],"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His portrayal of mob boss Whitey Bulger is a powerhouse performance and easily his best since he first introduced the world to Jack Sparrow. It's too bad the movie as a whole doesn't fair quite as well. Despite a great cast and some interestingly insane source material, somehow a movie about one of America's most infamous criminals feels more like small claims court. Director Cooper focuses his narrative on Bulger's less-than-legal partnership with the FBI. It's a fascinatingly close-knit community we witness (agents, felons, politicians, and families alike) in which loyalty and corruption go hand-in-hand. It's a grimy yet quiet 70's-feel gangster film that engages its audience nearly as much as it reminds them of better films. Therein lies its big problem: What is Black Mass offering that hasn't already been perfected in other gangster films? Unfortunately, instead of a true movie-making vision, it's like a guy watched every crime drama from the last 40 years and just spit out a less-interesting copycat. Not that a counterfeit of something great can't still have its positives: the score is beautiful and the performances from the top-notch cast around Depp are nearly as superb as his, all of whom nail the oft-parodied Bostonian accent with aplomb. But with too many side plots to juggle, not enough cohesion to the storytelling, and an unfortunate lack of auteur vision, Black Mass just can't stand against the great American crime films of yore (Chinatown, Godfather, Goodfellas).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":175214,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-09-18","keywords":"true crime,fbi agent,gangster,boston massachusetts,based on true story","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3616256793","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzNzA1OTYyNjJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDIzMzIxNDYx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzNzA1OTYyNjJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDIzMzIxNDYx._V1_.jpg","description":"The true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212722/","name":"Benedict Cumberbatch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424848/","name":"Dakota Johnson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0178376/","name":"Scott Cooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0285648/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0449458/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0307345/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3286851/","name":"Mark Mallouk"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125336/","name":"Jez Butterworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3251662/","name":"Dick Lehr"}],"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"Red Lights" really puts the hook in viewers, and is hard to stop watching once it gets going. You get the feeling Cortes is quite enthusiastic, just dying to tell you this yarn. His script is well-written, intelligent, and never bamboozles. Elisabeth Olsen is incandescent, and the performances from all the leads have them in top form. Some may criticize the film as being overproduced: many sequences are bursting forth with camera angles and takes, and these combined with Cortes's fulminating style of editing sometimes give the film the feel of "Desperate Hours." But I loved this film, loved the color palette, loved the patois and exposition, and admire Cortes's confident bombast.

"Red Lights" really puts the hook in viewers, and is hard to stop watching once it gets going. You get the feeling Cortes is quite enthusiastic, just dying to tell you this yarn. His script is well-written, intelligent, and never bamboozles. Elisabeth Olsen is incandescent, and the performances from all the leads have them in top form. Some may criticize the film as being overproduced: many sequences are bursting forth with camera angles and takes, and these combined with Cortes's fulminating style of editing sometimes give the film the feel of "Desperate Hours." But I loved this film, loved the color palette, loved the patois and exposition, and admire Cortes's confident bombast. Great things are coming from this filmmaker.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60505,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-03-02","keywords":"psychic,revelation,obsession,younger version of character,road trip","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3842417177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ4NzcyNTYwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc5ODg4MjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ4NzcyNTYwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc5ODg4MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Psychologist Margaret Matheson and her assistant study paranormal activity, which leads them to investigate a world-renowned psychic who has resurfaced years after his toughest critic mysteriously passed away.

What if I told you that this film had a setting of only one main location, two main actors and three supporting cast members?  While these elements don't make up what a classic movie sounds like on paper, add director Joel Schumacher (Bad Company, 8mm) into the mix, along with screenwriter Larry Cohen, who had this story handed down to him by Alfred Hitchcock himself about 30 years ago, and you have the perfect blend of blackmail, violence and extortion:  Phone Booth. The story begins by showing a glimpse into the life of Stu Shepard (Daredevil's Colin Farrell).  Stu is a New York hustler that people love to hate.  He is egotistical, two-faced to everyone he knows and does what he can for personal gratification.  He even fantasizes about cheating on his wife Kelly (Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell) and the object of that desire is Pamela McFadden (Dawson Creek's Katie Holmes).  Pam is a young actress trying to get her first break, while Stu has been grooming her for the big time.  To avoid having his calls to Pam appear on his cellular phone bill, Stu calls her from the lone phone booth left in the heart of NYC. However, things would be different on this day.  Upon hanging up, he receives a call that would turn his whole world upside down. The caller (24's Kiefer Sutherland) is a sniper, who has been targeting high-profile underhanded suits, just like Stu.  He has a few simple rules so that Stu does not meet the same fate that two others had before him: don't leave the booth, don't tell anyone who he's talking to, and most importantly, don't hang up.  To prove his seriousness, the caller shoots and kills a pimp who tries to physically remove Stu from the booth for taking too much time with his call.  This, as expected, does not help matters, and the fallen pimp's hookers now believe it was indeed Stu who committed the murder.  Soon, the NYPD and numerous media outlets are covering this serious situation. Things become increasingly difficult for Stu Shepard as Kelly and Pam both show up.  In the meantime, the caller continues to play various mind games, while the sympathetic NYPD Captain Ramey (Twilight Zone's Forest Whitaker) tries to solve the issue.  During all of this, Stu tries to maintain his sanity and not risk any more lives.  His lies no longer matter.  As a result, he must now search his soul, discover himself and attempt to outsmart the caller, taking the game to a whole new level. The cinematography is outstanding. Schumacher uses the right angle for every shot, and manages to keep everyone's attention with quick pans and abrupt cuts.  In the end, the 80-minute movie seems longer but not because it is boring.  The biggest payoff comes with the twist ending that changes the film's outcome within sixty seconds. There was not one bad performance in Phone Booth.  Farrell's ability to convert his Irish brogue to a Brooklyn drawl makes his performance as Bullseye in Daredevil look like a child's school play when compared to the Broadway-level of acting he manages here.  While Mitchell and Holmes did not have lengthy parts, their roles added just enough to the story and they managed to perform up to the standards of their characters.  Forest Whitaker was a surprisingly great addition to the cast and his role as a sympathetic cop is one that's not often seen, and should thus be welcomed.  However, all of these actors are outshined by Kiefer Sutherland, who ends up being extremely creepy and one of the best antagonists in recent movie history by just using his voice. Will this win Best Picture at next year's Academy Awards? It probably won't.  However, with a great story, top-notch directing and a cast with great chemistry, what more could you ask for?  Out of a possible five stars, I give this the limit of five with desires to go even higher.  While I would go see it again and again, not everyone has the same tastes.  However, I would put down the $8 for a ticket to see the flick at least once.  If nothing else, it will make you stop and think:  the next time you enter a phone booth, just who will be watching?"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":260971,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2003-06-11","keywords":"single set production,psychopath,phone booth,sniper,hostage","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Phone Booth","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi932970777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJkN2QxODUtN2Q2OS00OGE1LTk2ZjgtM2ExYjcyMTJlMDg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJkN2QxODUtN2Q2OS00OGE1LTk2ZjgtM2ExYjcyMTJlMDg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000662/","name":"Kiefer Sutherland"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001845/","name":"Forest Whitaker"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001708/","name":"Joel Schumacher"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150494/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0169540/","name":"Larry Cohen"}],"duration":"PT1H21M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Others also provide information and influence in shaping the decision on whether he should go back to Malaysia where jail conditions are so harsh his ability to survive a short term prison sentence is problematic.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14363,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1998-08-14","keywords":"guilt,redemption,malaysia,prison,moral responsibility","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Return To Paradise","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1956577561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ5YWY0ZjMtZGZiYi00M2JhLWI0MzMtYmY4M2RlYTFlODc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ5YWY0ZjMtZGZiYi00M2JhLWI0MzMtYmY4M2RlYTFlODc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from PolyGram Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000681/","name":"Vince Vaughn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000162/","name":"Anne Heche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001618/","name":"Joaquin Phoenix"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0747849/","name":"Joseph Ruben"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030612/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058765/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019483/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427136/","name":"Pierre Jolivet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770241/","name":"Olivier Schatzky","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0834338/","name":"Wesley Strick"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Halle Berry is a diver whose on/off boyfriend Olivier Martinez manages to coax her into taking an arrogant, wealthy, Brit and his son on a cruise to swim with sharks.

Paul is called upon to solve the strange rape &amp; murder of the title character, Elizabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson). Paul gets paired with a rape investigator named Sara Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe), who just happens to be a former flame of his. As Paul and Sara work the clues, they discover a string of characters who all have their secrets to hide. And it becomes apparent that the Army's main concern is keeping things quiet and maintaining the public image.\n\nWhile far from a great story, this is still an absorbing one. There's a very tragic and somber arc that stems from the Elizabeth Campbell character being a *very* troubled individual. The story isn't always too believable, but director Simon West keeps the plot progressing in competent enough fashion, with a couple of twists along the way. The more serious and sordid elements are sometimes contrasted with not terribly amusing banter between Travolta and Stowe.\n\nThe exemplary supporting cast is the main reason to watch. Travolta lays on the goofy charm a bit much at first (and does a deliberately bad Southern accent for too long a time), but as the movie goes on, the better his performance gets. He and Stowe are able to create some chemistry. Stefanson is effective as the victim, and James Cromwell as her general father is completely convincing. Clarence Williams III also scores strongly as the generals' comrade, who's loyal to the core. The real standout is the always dynamic James Woods, as Elizabeths' mentor; the scenes where he and Travolta are attempting to outwit each other are just about the best in the movie.\n\nWell shot (by Peter Menzies Jr.) and decently paced, "The General's Daughter" manages to be watchable for a little under two hours.\n\nSeven out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-10-06","keywords":"army,cover up,murder,rape,military","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The General's Daughter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1508549657","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZhZDJiODEtNDBjNC00NTUxLWE1ZWMtMGQ3N2IxYzkzZjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZhZDJiODEtNDBjNC00NTUxLWE1ZWMtMGQ3N2IxYzkzZjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The General's Daughter"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000656/","name":"Madeleine Stowe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000342/","name":"James Cromwell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922346/","name":"Simon West"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075914/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067370/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0218491/","name":"Nelson DeMille"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0078203/","name":"Christopher Bertolini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001279/","name":"William Goldman"}],"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Also with brilliant acting from the cast (the ensemble includes Depp, Paul Ruebens, Penelope Cruz and in a twist of a role from GoodFellas, Ray Liotta as Jung's dad) and a well told story, this is one of the best bio-pics and drug movies of the 00's.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":250534,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-04-06","keywords":"drug abuse,nosebleed,police officer,drug cartel,united states","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3504603417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzUyMmUwMWQtYWFkZC00YTAxLWJiNjUtMTA0NzY0OTZlMGFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzUyMmUwMWQtYWFkZC00YTAxLWJiNjUtMTA0NzY0OTZlMGFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from New Line Cinema","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004851/","name":"Penélope Cruz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004376/","name":"Franka Potente"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001130/","name":"Ted Demme"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072799/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028247/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0692051/","name":"Bruce Porter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571346/","name":"David McKenna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001024/","name":"Nick Cassavetes"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Literally the entire first half of the film could've been cut down to 10 mins max. The scenes were too long, and/or unnecessary, and most were just plain ridiculous. There was a hefty lack of logic, with major plot and technical issues, and you'll find yourself either laughing or cringing at most scenes.\n\nThe pacing was horrible, and with the majority of the story being cheesy af, the normally comfortable 95 min runtime felt like 3+ hours. You'll be tempted to fast forward much of the film, and trust me, you wont miss much. Only the last 15 mins of the film felt like an adequate film production with good continuity in the scenes, and some decent drama and suspense, albeit predictable.\n\nAnd what was Burns thinking with probably the worst cinematography I've seen in a long time? Were blue and earth-tones the only color filter palette choices? There's a scene when Willis arrives and greets his niece at the cabin, and all that stands out is her bright blue jeans in the entire scene. And the constant distant shots of the skyline, valleys and hills got very tiring fast.\n\nThe acting for the most part was bad and unconvincing - I'm sure in part due to Burns' inexperience in directing his cast, and Willis was his usual drab "I'm only here for the paycheck". Only Jaime King's performance was good and convincing throughout, and she basically carried the entire film.\n\nThe only decent component in this production was the score, which although still the typical B-film loud and overbearing score, it at least was somewhat fitting and wasn't playing through-out the entire 95 mins. But then again, this is Burns' main field of expertise in the film industry - music director, so had he messed that up, he'd have some 'splaining to do. The soundtrack was also fairly decent, although it played in many scenes that didn't really need loud country/rock music playing in the background.\n\nIt's a very generous 3/10 from me, mostly for King's performance, and also cutting the newb filmmakers some slack. Hopefully they learn from their mistakes.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3655,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2021-07-16","keywords":"low budget,hiking,urn of creamated ashes,rain,voice over journal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Out of Death","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi538624025","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTczN2UwZTctOWU2NC00N2I0LTkxMDctYmVkYmM5ZmFkMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTczN2UwZTctOWU2NC00N2I0LTkxMDctYmVkYmM5ZmFkMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454809/","name":"Jaime King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2742160/","name":"Lala Kent"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1230733/","name":"Mike Burns"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017712/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274103/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0474730/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11672642/","name":"Bill Lawrence"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Tim detektiva iz 99. stanice u Bruklinu dobija novog kapetana Rejmonda Holta, veoma ozbiljnog i strogog komandantnog oficira, za razliku od ranijeg kapetana na koga su se svi u ovoj stanici navikli, i zato nastaje sukob detektiva Paralte i Rejmonda. Ejmi Santijago, vredna detektivka koja se uvek drži knjige, u početku ima kompetativni odnos sa Džejkom zbog brojnih uspeha sa obe strane, a kasnije njihova netrpljivost prerasta u romantičnu vezu. Takođe u ovoj stanici se nalaze detektiv Čarls Bojl, Džejkov najbolji drug, narednik Teri Džefords, veoma snažan i krupan ali osetljiv i porodičan čovek, Roza Dijaz, veoma agresivna i sposobna detektivka, asistentkinja Đina Lineti, veoma duhovit lik u seriji, i dva već starija detektiva koji su sada zaduženi za kancelarijski deo policijskog posla, Hičkok i Skali.</desc>

Uprkos tome što nema socijalne veštine i ne snalazi se u međuljudskim odnosima i nepoznati su mu pojmovi poput sreće i ljubavi, on je neverovatan stručnjak. Doktor Šon je izuzetno drag i inteligentan, ali ga šef ipak uzima na zub, zbog njegovog direktnosti i nespretnog ponašanja prema pacijentima, međutim, njegova genijlanost je neosporna.</desc>

Međutim, oba potencijalna naslednika stradaju na Titaniku... Robert i Kora Kroli, lord i ledi od Grantama, imaju tri ćerke - Meri, Idit i Sibil, ali nemaju muških potomaka, te će po zakonu njihovo veliko imanje pripasti najbližem rođaku umesto njihovoj najstarijoj kćerki Meri. Ledi Meri je pristala da se uda za svog drugog rođaka Patrika, sina tadašnjeg pretpostavljenog DŽejmsa Krolija. Serija počinje dan nakon potapanja Titanika u aprilu 1912, kada Krolijevi saznaju da su i DŽejms i Ptarik poginuli u potapanju. U potrazi za novim naslednikom, nalaze još daljeg muškog rođaka, Metjua Krolija, advokata, pripadnika srednje klase. Uprkos njihovoj poniznosti i ljupkosti, ne dočekuje ih topla dobrodošlica. Meri i njena baba će iskoristiti svaku priliku da ponize Metjua i njegovu majku Izabel i stave im do znanja da nisu isti nivo. Međutim, grof i grofica će se truditi da se prema njima ophode onako kako dolikuje i kako zaslužuju, pa makar to bilo protivno željama njihovih kćerki i majke. Radnja se u početku usredsređuje na odnos između Ledi Meri i Metjua, koji se odupire prihvaćanju aristokratskog načina života, dok se Ledi Meri opire činjenici da joj se novi naslednik dopada.</desc>

Tim detektiva iz 99. stanice u Bruklinu dobija novog kapetana Rejmonda Holta, veoma ozbiljnog i strogog komandantnog oficira, za razliku od ranijeg kapetana na koga su se svi u ovoj stanici navikli, i zato nastaje sukob detektiva Paralte i Rejmonda. Ejmi Santijago, vredna detektivka koja se uvek drži knjige, u početku ima kompetativni odnos sa Džejkom zbog brojnih uspeha sa obe strane, a kasnije njihova netrpljivost prerasta u romantičnu vezu. Takođe u ovoj stanici se nalaze detektiv Čarls Bojl, Džejkov najbolji drug, narednik Teri Džefords, veoma snažan i krupan ali osetljiv i porodičan čovek, Roza Dijaz, veoma agresivna i sposobna detektivka, asistentkinja Đina Lineti, veoma duhovit lik u seriji, i dva već starija detektiva koji su sada zaduženi za kancelarijski deo policijskog posla, Hičkok i Skali.</desc>

Uprkos tome što nema socijalne veštine i ne snalazi se u međuljudskim odnosima i nepoznati su mu pojmovi poput sreće i ljubavi, on je neverovatan stručnjak. Doktor Šon je izuzetno drag i inteligentan, ali ga šef ipak uzima na zub, zbog njegovog direktnosti i nespretnog ponašanja prema pacijentima, međutim, njegova genijlanost je neosporna.</desc>

Međutim, oba potencijalna naslednika stradaju na Titaniku... Robert i Kora Kroli, lord i ledi od Grantama, imaju tri ćerke - Meri, Idit i Sibil, ali nemaju muških potomaka, te će po zakonu njihovo veliko imanje pripasti najbližem rođaku umesto njihovoj najstarijoj kćerki Meri. Ledi Meri je pristala da se uda za svog drugog rođaka Patrika, sina tadašnjeg pretpostavljenog DŽejmsa Krolija. Serija počinje dan nakon potapanja Titanika u aprilu 1912, kada Krolijevi saznaju da su i DŽejms i Ptarik poginuli u potapanju. U potrazi za novim naslednikom, nalaze još daljeg muškog rođaka, Metjua Krolija, advokata, pripadnika srednje klase. Uprkos njihovoj poniznosti i ljupkosti, ne dočekuje ih topla dobrodošlica. Meri i njena baba će iskoristiti svaku priliku da ponize Metjua i njegovu majku Izabel i stave im do znanja da nisu isti nivo. Međutim, grof i grofica će se truditi da se prema njima ophode onako kako dolikuje i kako zaslužuju, pa makar to bilo protivno željama njihovih kćerki i majke. Radnja se u početku usredsređuje na odnos između Ledi Meri i Metjua, koji se odupire prihvaćanju aristokratskog načina života, dok se Ledi Meri opire činjenici da joj se novi naslednik dopada.</desc>

"The Good Doctor" je američka, medicinska, dramska serija u kojoj je glavni lik neobični, mladi hirurg Šon Marfi, autistični genije koji sve posmatra drugačije od ostalih i koji se iz rodnog Vajominga seli u San Hoze kako bi se zaposlio u prestižnoj bolnici Svetog Bonaventure. Uprkos tome što nema socijalne veštine i ne snalazi se u međuljudskim odnosima i nepoznati su mu pojmovi poput sreće i ljubavi, on je neverovatan stručnjak. Doktor Šon je izuzetno drag i inteligentan, ali ga šef ipak uzima na zub, zbog njegovog direktnosti i nespretnog ponašanja prema pacijentima, međutim, njegova genijlanost je neosporna.</desc>

Kriminalistička, dramska serija prati slučajeve simpatičnog i sasvim neobičnog detektiva, Adrijana Monka. Monk pati od opsesivno-kompulsivnog poremećaja, od kad je doživeo stres posle smrti supruge. Iako je nakon nervnog sloma otpušten iz policije, njegovo fotografsko pamćenje i fantastična moć opažanja, omogućuju mu da reši slučajeve u kojima je policija nemoćna.</desc>

Ejmi Santijago, vredna detektivka koja se uvek drži knjige, u početku ima kompetativni odnos sa Džejkom zbog brojnih uspeha sa obe strane, a kasnije njihova netrpljivost prerasta u romantičnu vezu. Takođe u ovoj stanici se nalaze detektiv Čarls Bojl, Džejkov najbolji drug, narednik Teri Džefords, veoma snažan i krupan ali osetljiv i porodičan čovek, Roza Dijaz, veoma agresivna i sposobna detektivka, asistentkinja Đina Lineti, veoma duhovit lik u seriji, i dva već starija detektiva koji su sada zaduženi za kancelarijski deo policijskog posla, Hičkok i Skali.</desc>

Annabelle is pleasing. And that's good.","reviewBody":"I can't say that Annabelle is a good film. There's nothing original about it. But I can say that I found it to be fine and pleasant to watch. Sure, there are a number of well executed scares, but its 1969 setting and cinematography by James Kniest provide it with a dreamy quality. Annabelle isn't about gore. It's that rare film these days that aims to scare you by building dread with patience and restraint. Director John R. Leonetti should be applauded for this. The best executed sequence occurs at the beginning of the film when we get to see what happens to Mia (Annabelle Wallis) and John Form's (Ward Horton) neighbors through their bedroom window. On the downside the script by Gary Dauberman just doesn't have enough good material for the film's 99 minute running time. Just like in The Conjuring (2013) there is a buildup of scares until the shocking ending, but in Annabelle this becomes repetitive because the scares are practically the same. This didn't bother me much though because Wallis and Horton are charismatic enough actors to make us care about Mia and John. I definitely liked them more than the characters in The Conjuring.

Annabelle is pleasing. And that's good.","reviewBody":"I can't say that Annabelle is a good film. There's nothing original about it. But I can say that I found it to be fine and pleasant to watch. Sure, there are a number of well executed scares, but its 1969 setting and cinematography by James Kniest provide it with a dreamy quality. Annabelle isn't about gore. It's that rare film these days that aims to scare you by building dread with patience and restraint. Director John R. Leonetti should be applauded for this. The best executed sequence occurs at the beginning of the film when we get to see what happens to Mia (Annabelle Wallis) and John Form's (Ward Horton) neighbors through their bedroom window. On the downside the script by Gary Dauberman just doesn't have enough good material for the film's 99 minute running time. Just like in The Conjuring (2013) there is a buildup of scares until the shocking ending, but in Annabelle this becomes repetitive because the scares are practically the same. This didn't bother me much though because Wallis and Horton are charismatic enough actors to make us care about Mia and John. I definitely liked them more than the characters in The Conjuring. It's not hard to realize that Annabelle is influenced by Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. While it's not as good as that 1968 film, Annabelle is still a good time at the movies and I recommend it. The film may seem like a cash grab after the success of The Conjuring, but Leonetti and the actors turned it into something enjoyable.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":152387,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-10-03","keywords":"possessed doll,murder,suicide,evil doll,occult","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3917261849","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5ODA4MDM2NTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDE3NjUxMjMx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5ODA4MDM2NTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDE3NjUxMjMx._V1_.jpg","description":"John Form has found the perfect gift for his expectant wife, Mia -- a rare vintage doll in a pure white wedding dress. \r\nSoon after, their home is invaded by members of a satanic cult, but spilled blood and terror are not all they leave behind.

The effects are good, although the horror might have meant more to me if I understand all of it better but regardless it is certainly an experience that is worth having at some point.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89227,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1983-02-04","keywords":"snuff film,hallucination,surrealism,suicide,satire","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Videodrome","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2063270169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAxYmI0YzEtZTFmNi00NmUwLWJjYWYtMzAzOTMyYmM5OGNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAxYmI0YzEtZTFmNi00NmUwLWJjYWYtMzAzOTMyYmM5OGNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Universal Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000249/","name":"James Woods","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001323/","name":"Debbie Harry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0810500/","name":"Sonja Smits"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000343/","name":"David Cronenberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006008/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053910/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051074/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000343/","name":"David Cronenberg"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":702453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":702453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"],"duration":"PT2H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The computer effects looked badly integrated, the Green Goblin's costume looked awful and comic book adaptations usually have such painful scripting and plotting. Thankfully I was wrong on most counts (The Goblin still looks rubbish).\n\nAs it turns out, this is probably the best super-hero film I've yet seen - certainly up there with Superman and Batman. People seem to automatically comment that the script and acting was bad because they expect it to be the case in these films; and indeed it usually is. But if you go into Spider-man without this prejudicial attitude you'll be pleasently suprised. The acting is generally great - there is never a time when anyone is not believable as their character and you think "Hey, that's an actor, not Peter Parker". The effects do look artificial but the pace of the movie means you don't have time to dwell on this and the script is fine! What do people want, Shakespearian soliloquies? That would sound incredibly out-of-place in modern day New York. There are few of the painful cliches or dreadful dialogue that plague films like The Phantom Menace and the catchphrases like "friendly neighbourhood spider-man" are fully in-keeping with the character.\n\n The comic turns from J.J. Jameson hit the mark, the snarling facial contortions of Willem Defoe were suitably evil-looking (and the conversation with his mirror-image was a great touch). My only gripe was with the Green Goblin's costume. Very monotone green and not very scary.\n\nAll-in-all a great film that I wouldn't hesitate for a second in recommending."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":755785,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2002-06-12","keywords":"superhero,may parker character,peter parker character,ben parker character,spiderweb","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spider-Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1497605145","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDYyNzU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY1NDk2OA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDYyNzU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY1NDk2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for Spider-Man"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001497/","name":"Tobey Maguire"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000353/","name":"Willem Dafoe"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000600/","name":"Sam Raimi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0228492/","name":"Steve Ditko"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"}],"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Thankfully I was wrong on most counts (The Goblin still looks rubbish).\n\nAs it turns out, this is probably the best super-hero film I've yet seen - certainly up there with Superman and Batman. People seem to automatically comment that the script and acting was bad because they expect it to be the case in these films; and indeed it usually is. But if you go into Spider-man without this prejudicial attitude you'll be pleasently suprised. The acting is generally great - there is never a time when anyone is not believable as their character and you think "Hey, that's an actor, not Peter Parker". The effects do look artificial but the pace of the movie means you don't have time to dwell on this and the script is fine! What do people want, Shakespearian soliloquies? That would sound incredibly out-of-place in modern day New York. There are few of the painful cliches or dreadful dialogue that plague films like The Phantom Menace and the catchphrases like "friendly neighbourhood spider-man" are fully in-keeping with the character.\n\n The comic turns from J.J. Jameson hit the mark, the snarling facial contortions of Willem Defoe were suitably evil-looking (and the conversation with his mirror-image was a great touch). My only gripe was with the Green Goblin's costume. Very monotone green and not very scary.\n\nAll-in-all a great film that I wouldn't hesitate for a second in recommending.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":755785,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2002-06-12","keywords":"superhero,may parker character,peter parker character,ben parker character,spiderweb","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spider-Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1497605145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDYyNzU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY1NDk2OA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDYyNzU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY1NDk2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for Spider-Man","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001497/","name":"Tobey Maguire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000353/","name":"Willem Dafoe"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000600/","name":"Sam Raimi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0228492/","name":"Steve Ditko","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"],"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sprijateljivši se sa Leftijem Ruđerom, Pistone pod imenom Doni Brasko ulazi u mafijašku grupu predvođenu Sonijem Blekom. Stari mafijaš "Lefti" (Al Paćino) uzima pod okrilje mladog sitnog lopova Donija Braska (Džoni Dep) koji je u stvari tajni agent FBI. Neuobičajeno prijateljstvo i poverenje se rađa između dva muškarca. Doni brzo napreduje na hijerarhijskoj lestvici jedne od najznačajnijih mafijaških porodica, istovremeno zanemarujući sopstvenu porodicu. Prijateljstvo, odanost porodici i izdaja sjajno su prikazani u ovom napetom trileru.</desc>

Ben Affleck, the once ridiculed but now stupendous entertainer. J.K. Simmons, the distinguished actor from Whiplash. Jon Bernthal, the rising star from The Walking Dead who's a known but yet still unknown actor, and he's great by the way. John Lithgow, an actor who delivers uncanny especially when he's the villain. Bill Dubuque, who the hell is this guy, but he wrote this movie, and this appears to be his first major project besides Robert Downey Jr's The Judge. I enjoy all of these people's work one way or another. This movie has a good director, good leading man, and an all-star cast. From the trailers, this movie seemed like an intellectual movie about a young boy growing up with mental problems, the boy grows up and becomes an accountant, through his work he does business with shady characters, for some reason his clients want him dead, but we know The Accountant is far more capable of much more than they know. I was anticipating this movie based on all the information I just provided. I thought this movie couldn't miss. Is The Accountant a good movie? The Accountant is a good movie.\n\nThe direction of this seems rather simple, but as the story progresses, things become a bit too complicated, and maybe not for the better. \n\nI understood the main story and what was happening. The subplot of the movie is what threw me off. I thought the secondary plot was a bit messy but yet still engaging.\n\nThe acting in this movie was excellent. I think Ben Affleck as Christan Wolff is the best character he's ever played. Affleck's performance is both engaging and mesmerizing. Everyone does their job here, but Affleck steals the show.\n\nThe violence feels ultra realistic. I love action movies, but none have felt as real as this in a long time. When The Accountant kills people, he kills people, and it's not pretty.\n\nThere's a lot of jump cutting that's present here. This movie constantly jumps from the past to the present without warning, but the transitions are fluid.\n\nThe execution of the story at times feels tedious due to its consistent jump cutting, multi-layered plot, and abundance of characters.\n\nEach character gets their moment, and everyone plays a part, but it's the coincidence that brings them all together.\n\nI think this movie is trying to be more than what it is, and it succeeds. The Accountant movie has a multi-layered engaging main plot about mental illness in young children and how they cope with their situations. The secondary plot is about The Accountant doing business with the wrong people. There's another plot to this movie with J.K Simmons and his story's compelling, but it lacks conviction.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this movie. The fight scenes and choreography were breathtaking. The main plot was engaging. Ben Affleck delivered the best performance of his career. Every actor played their part.

Ben Affleck, the once ridiculed but now stupendous entertainer. J.K. Simmons, the distinguished actor from Whiplash. Jon Bernthal, the rising star from The Walking Dead who's a known but yet still unknown actor, and he's great by the way. John Lithgow, an actor who delivers uncanny especially when he's the villain. Bill Dubuque, who the hell is this guy, but he wrote this movie, and this appears to be his first major project besides Robert Downey Jr's The Judge. I enjoy all of these people's work one way or another. This movie has a good director, good leading man, and an all-star cast. From the trailers, this movie seemed like an intellectual movie about a young boy growing up with mental problems, the boy grows up and becomes an accountant, through his work he does business with shady characters, for some reason his clients want him dead, but we know The Accountant is far more capable of much more than they know. I was anticipating this movie based on all the information I just provided. I thought this movie couldn't miss. Is The Accountant a good movie? The Accountant is a good movie.\n\nThe direction of this seems rather simple, but as the story progresses, things become a bit too complicated, and maybe not for the better. \n\nI understood the main story and what was happening. The subplot of the movie is what threw me off. I thought the secondary plot was a bit messy but yet still engaging.\n\nThe acting in this movie was excellent. I think Ben Affleck as Christan Wolff is the best character he's ever played. Affleck's performance is both engaging and mesmerizing. Everyone does their job here, but Affleck steals the show.\n\nThe violence feels ultra realistic. I love action movies, but none have felt as real as this in a long time. When The Accountant kills people, he kills people, and it's not pretty.\n\nThere's a lot of jump cutting that's present here. This movie constantly jumps from the past to the present without warning, but the transitions are fluid.\n\nThe execution of the story at times feels tedious due to its consistent jump cutting, multi-layered plot, and abundance of characters.\n\nEach character gets their moment, and everyone plays a part, but it's the coincidence that brings them all together.\n\nI think this movie is trying to be more than what it is, and it succeeds. The Accountant movie has a multi-layered engaging main plot about mental illness in young children and how they cope with their situations. The secondary plot is about The Accountant doing business with the wrong people. There's another plot to this movie with J.K Simmons and his story's compelling, but it lacks conviction.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this movie. The fight scenes and choreography were breathtaking. The main plot was engaging. Ben Affleck delivered the best performance of his career. Every actor played their part. This movie suffers from sensory overload, but regardless, I believe that it will stimulate not only intellectuals but white-knuckled action junkies as well. The main plot, Ben Affleck, and the violence is ferocious.\n\nFinal Grade: A-","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":282412,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-10-26","keywords":"accountant,autism,autistic child,assassin,brother brother relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2433726233","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNjQxODgzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzM4NDY1OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNjQxODgzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzM4NDY1OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Christian Wolff is a math savant with more affinity for numbers than people.
