    <title lang="hr">Hanibal</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Hannibal: Directed by Ridley Scott. With Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta.

As Starling works under the demeaning supervision of Agent Krendler, Lecter begins to taunt her with letters from an unknown location. Meanwhile in Florence, Inspector Pazzi begins to suspect the identity of the new curator, while Verger places a $3million reward for anyone who will bring him information leading to Lecter.\n\nThe sequel that everyone wanted to see and that got lots of headlines for it's gory content was not something I was very bothered about seeing. Although I think Silence was a good film I was a bit surprised by the sheer volume and degree of praise that was heaped upon it. However I decided I would give it a go when it finally came on television and I pretty much got what I expected  a gory film that trades on blood and it's title character without a great deal else of real value put in with it. The story is very condensed from the book (so I'm told anyway) and is basically boiled down to a handful of events that will deliver the shock and gore if that's all you want  but that's not all I wanted. I needed a lot more in fact and I have a better appreciation of what made the first film a much better one than this.\n\nFor one thing the whole film lacks suspense  by which I mean real suspense and tension, not just the suspense as we await the imminent arrive of the next gory scene. The plot is a little bit daffy at points and this may be done to it's slimmed down nature  certainly I was not drawn in so much as merely standing by watching it. The film also asks a lot of us; it asks us to understand the relationship dynamic between Lecter and Starling even though it shows us very little here  almost like it is expecting us just to take it on face value and remember Silence without it carrying anything through. Also it asked us to like, even support, Lecter  an idea that I found wholly unappealing. There is nothing wrong with having a monster as your 'hero' character or of focusing on the dark side of humanity but here the film practically revels in the gore, almost forgetting all else. It has made Lecter such a comical character ('okay-dokay'?) that it doesn't really know what to do with itself when he is off screen. The fact that it doesn't do anything with this dark beast other than stare lovingly at him is a problem for me and just supported the idea that the film was out for gore.\n\nEven the cast seem to realize that this film is nowhere near the caliber of Silence and they all seem to have their tongue in their cheeks with their performances. Hopkins seems to relish the chance to overplay in a big payday for him (the film could happen without Foster but not without him). His character is so much more played for fun than in Silence and this damages the tension, but Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself nonetheless. Moore plays it totally straight and doesn't have much fun  she is good but she doesn't stand out even if she does replace Foster well. An unrecognisable Oldman also hams it up but keeps his character just this side of silly Ivanek supports Oldman well but is obviously eclipsed by the latter's showy role. Giannini is good in his minor role and is lucky to escape the script's excesses; sadly Liotta is not free and his performance towards the end matches the absurdity of the plot in his regard.\n\nOverall this is a big fancy horror movie but it is far from the standard of Silence. It lacks real bite (sorry) in terms of tension and excitement and it replaces it with a series of increasingly gory set pieces. If all you want is superficial delivery then this is worth seeing as it is enjoyable as a gory horror but it is no more than that and fans of the mood and atmosphere of Silence Of The Lambs will feel a little cheated."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-03-14","keywords":"hannibal lecter,police,cannibal,pistol,villain played by lead actor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hannibal","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1300339481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM/UA"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365383/","name":"Thomas Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000519/","name":"David Mamet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001873/","name":"Steven Zaillian"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The story is very condensed from the book (so I'm told anyway) and is basically boiled down to a handful of events that will deliver the shock and gore if that's all you want  but that's not all I wanted. I needed a lot more in fact and I have a better appreciation of what made the first film a much better one than this.\n\nFor one thing the whole film lacks suspense  by which I mean real suspense and tension, not just the suspense as we await the imminent arrive of the next gory scene. The plot is a little bit daffy at points and this may be done to it's slimmed down nature  certainly I was not drawn in so much as merely standing by watching it. The film also asks a lot of us; it asks us to understand the relationship dynamic between Lecter and Starling even though it shows us very little here  almost like it is expecting us just to take it on face value and remember Silence without it carrying anything through. Also it asked us to like, even support, Lecter  an idea that I found wholly unappealing. There is nothing wrong with having a monster as your 'hero' character or of focusing on the dark side of humanity but here the film practically revels in the gore, almost forgetting all else. It has made Lecter such a comical character ('okay-dokay'?) that it doesn't really know what to do with itself when he is off screen. The fact that it doesn't do anything with this dark beast other than stare lovingly at him is a problem for me and just supported the idea that the film was out for gore.\n\nEven the cast seem to realize that this film is nowhere near the caliber of Silence and they all seem to have their tongue in their cheeks with their performances. Hopkins seems to relish the chance to overplay in a big payday for him (the film could happen without Foster but not without him). His character is so much more played for fun than in Silence and this damages the tension, but Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself nonetheless. Moore plays it totally straight and doesn't have much fun  she is good but she doesn't stand out even if she does replace Foster well. An unrecognisable Oldman also hams it up but keeps his character just this side of silly Ivanek supports Oldman well but is obviously eclipsed by the latter's showy role. Giannini is good in his minor role and is lucky to escape the script's excesses; sadly Liotta is not free and his performance towards the end matches the absurdity of the plot in his regard.\n\nOverall this is a big fancy horror movie but it is far from the standard of Silence. It lacks real bite (sorry) in terms of tension and excitement and it replaces it with a series of increasingly gory set pieces. If all you want is superficial delivery then this is worth seeing as it is enjoyable as a gory horror but it is no more than that and fans of the mood and atmosphere of Silence Of The Lambs will feel a little cheated.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-03-14","keywords":"hannibal lecter,police,cannibal,pistol,villain played by lead actor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hannibal","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1300339481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM/UA","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365383/","name":"Thomas Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000519/","name":"David Mamet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001873/","name":"Steven Zaillian"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="hr">Hollywood Singing And Dancing</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical Treasure: Directed by Mark McLaughlin. With Julie Andrews, Fred Astaire, Obba Babatundé, John Badham. HOLLYWOOD SINGING &amp; DANCING: A MUSICAL TREASURE is a celebration of song and dance, beginning with the Busby Berkeley films that lifted the spirits of audiences during the Great Depression, through the patriotic musicals of the 1940s and ending with the collapse of the studio system in the 1950s. Hosted by Academy Award winning stage, screen and television icon, Shirley Jones, this "docutainment" film is a grand historical look at the magic of musical Hollywood. Highlighted are amazing songs and dance numbers, little-known facts, and luminaries who made the magic possible such as Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Shirley Temple, Betty Grable, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, James Cagney, Vincente Minnelli, Stanley Donen, Frank Sinatra, Leslie Caron, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger. Mesmerizing sequences are interspersed with fresh new commentary by Liza Minnelli, Leslie Caron, Debbie Reynolds, Mickey Rooney, Jane Russell, Rita Moreno, Pat Boone, Rob Marshall, Bill Condon, Shirley MacLaine, Tommy Tune, Joel Grey, Smokey Robinson, Patti Page, Tab Hunter, George Chakiris, Rhonda Fleming, Betty Garrett, Marge Champion, Joan Leslie, Robert Osborne, Stella Stevens, Gloria Stuart and others.

But, unfortunatelly, it real tries.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11742,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1999-04-01","keywords":"battle,knight,monster,warrior,sword and sorcery","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Beowulf (1999)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi176006681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTZhYTg3YzktN2UyYi00N2U1LWJmMjctYmM5MDdjODNhNTdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTZhYTg3YzktN2UyYi00N2U1LWJmMjctYmM5MDdjODNhNTdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Beowulf","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000483/","name":"Christopher Lambert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593961/","name":"Rhona Mitra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0183122/","name":"Oliver Cotton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048491/","name":"Graham Baker"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060324/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070928/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1511619/","name":"Anonymous","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494996/","name":"Mark Leahy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0152572/","name":"David Chappe"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was a big fan of the original. Loved it as a kid, although I know it's not a great film or anything.\n\nI was surprised at how fun the remake was, although it is a superficial kind of fun. The original had better casting and stronger character development. Reynolds and Eddie Albert are so wonderful in their roles, Sandler and the new warden are pretty damn lame in comparison. And the original spent more time building the characters, so that by the end, the film really resonated in a way the remake does not.\n\nBUT, the remake is a fun &amp; energetic piece of pop entertainment. It goes much more for broad comedy and pretty much succeeds. It's not super- hilarious, but it's funny enough and much funnier than the original. Although Sandler is wrong for the part, he's likable enough. Chris Rock is funny, as are some of the others. And the overall brisk pace keeps the whole thing afloat.\n\nYes, it's a disposable movie. It lacks the dark undercurrents that made the first one so good. It even seems to self-consciously acknowledge that it will never stand outside the shadow of Burt Reynolds. No, it doesn't have as much substance, but it has its own childish charm.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":171546,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Sport"],"datePublished":"2005-08-10","keywords":"frame up,scantily clad female,voyeur,voyeurism,football helmet","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Longest Yard","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi821428505","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRlYmJmYjgtMTFmMy00NDg4LTlmYTYtMjJhMzFiMDU3ZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRlYmJmYjgtMTFmMy00NDg4LTlmYTYtMjJhMzFiMDU3ZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000608/","name":"Burt Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001674/","name":"Chris Rock"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0781842/","name":"Peter Segal"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748665/","name":"Albert S.

I was a big fan of the original. Loved it as a kid, although I know it's not a great film or anything.\n\nI was surprised at how fun the remake was, although it is a superficial kind of fun. The original had better casting and stronger character development. Reynolds and Eddie Albert are so wonderful in their roles, Sandler and the new warden are pretty damn lame in comparison. And the original spent more time building the characters, so that by the end, the film really resonated in a way the remake does not.\n\nBUT, the remake is a fun &amp; energetic piece of pop entertainment. It goes much more for broad comedy and pretty much succeeds. It's not super- hilarious, but it's funny enough and much funnier than the original. Although Sandler is wrong for the part, he's likable enough. Chris Rock is funny, as are some of the others. And the overall brisk pace keeps the whole thing afloat.\n\nYes, it's a disposable movie. It lacks the dark undercurrents that made the first one so good. It even seems to self-consciously acknowledge that it will never stand outside the shadow of Burt Reynolds. No, it doesn't have as much substance, but it has its own childish charm.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":171546,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Sport"],"datePublished":"2005-08-10","keywords":"frame up,scantily clad female,voyeur,voyeurism,football helmet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Longest Yard","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi821428505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRlYmJmYjgtMTFmMy00NDg4LTlmYTYtMjJhMzFiMDU3ZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRlYmJmYjgtMTFmMy00NDg4LTlmYTYtMjJhMzFiMDU3ZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000608/","name":"Burt Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001674/","name":"Chris Rock"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0781842/","name":"Peter Segal"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748665/","name":"Albert S.

The good acting, the spot on cast, the refreshingly unbearable scares, the "Paul Verhovenesque" completely unnecessary but compellingly disgusting gore, the almost uniquely un-Hollywood ending... It's all there.\n\nWhat is even more amazing about this movie is that it's [re]creators have also managed to tap into what will surely be the unanimous expectations of the target audience. There are no unwanted and unnecessary messages of family values, cheese, cuddles, and love will conquer all, which is fabulous because it leaves far more room for classic lines like, "Tell him to shoot Burt Reynolds" and then the ketchup-tastic head shot that follows. Now you have to admit, that line really can't fit perfectly in to many movies but in the ever consistent mood of Dawn of the Dead, it's right at home.\n\nVing Rhames is easily the second best thing in the movie (second only to the fast moving, constantly hungry and occasionally limbless zombies) once he actually starts speaking, and it is welcoming that Sarah Polley's Ana is as composed as she is subtle which is great for the audience because for a change the lead female character is not screaming every 30 seconds because, oh my god, someone is trying to bite me whilst drooling oodles of blood and saliva all over my nice white t-shirt. again!\n\nHer character is only clichéd and therefore flawed once throughout the campaign. As the genius of the group, she is the first to work out that when people are bitten they become very ugly, very quickly and develop a penchant for biting others. However she is still inexplicably opposed to killing the aforementioned soon-to-be cannibals. I don't know about you but whilst she was still talking through the morale dilemma of killing would-be zombies before they turned, I'd already be choosing which sponge I was going to use to clean my shoes after removing my trusty shot gun from a red blob that used to be somebody's face.

The good acting, the spot on cast, the refreshingly unbearable scares, the "Paul Verhovenesque" completely unnecessary but compellingly disgusting gore, the almost uniquely un-Hollywood ending... It's all there.\n\nWhat is even more amazing about this movie is that it's [re]creators have also managed to tap into what will surely be the unanimous expectations of the target audience. There are no unwanted and unnecessary messages of family values, cheese, cuddles, and love will conquer all, which is fabulous because it leaves far more room for classic lines like, "Tell him to shoot Burt Reynolds" and then the ketchup-tastic head shot that follows. Now you have to admit, that line really can't fit perfectly in to many movies but in the ever consistent mood of Dawn of the Dead, it's right at home.\n\nVing Rhames is easily the second best thing in the movie (second only to the fast moving, constantly hungry and occasionally limbless zombies) once he actually starts speaking, and it is welcoming that Sarah Polley's Ana is as composed as she is subtle which is great for the audience because for a change the lead female character is not screaming every 30 seconds because, oh my god, someone is trying to bite me whilst drooling oodles of blood and saliva all over my nice white t-shirt. again!\n\nHer character is only clichéd and therefore flawed once throughout the campaign. As the genius of the group, she is the first to work out that when people are bitten they become very ugly, very quickly and develop a penchant for biting others. However she is still inexplicably opposed to killing the aforementioned soon-to-be cannibals. I don't know about you but whilst she was still talking through the morale dilemma of killing would-be zombies before they turned, I'd already be choosing which sponge I was going to use to clean my shoes after removing my trusty shot gun from a red blob that used to be somebody's face. Maybe that's just me though. us Sagittarians are very impulsive.\n\nSince we all have limited attention spans and I'm mindful of not giving too much away about what happens in the move, I'll wrap up by saying that those of you out there who enjoyed this film's original version and have gone on to enjoy films like Starship Troopers, Robocop, Resident Evil etc., then this is definitely the film for you.

    <title lang="hr">Mala bubnjarica</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Mala bubnjarica je priča temeljena na istoimenom književnom remek-djelu Johna le Carréa. To je ujedno strastvena ljubavna priča i duboko upečatljiv triler. Serija "Mala bubnjarica" temelji se na istoimenom bestseleru Johna le Carréa. To je strastvena ljubavna priča i triler koji će vas potpuno zaokupiti. Priča je jednako smiona sada kao što je bila kad je knjiga prvi put objavljena; to je prikaz svijeta u kojem su granice između junaka i zlikovaca te ljubavi i mržnje opasno nejasne. Taj uzbudljivi triler događa se krajem sedamdesetih godina prošloga stoljeća i pratimo Charlie (Pugh), mladu, vatrenu, ali neostvarenu britansku glumicu punu ideala. Na odmoru u Grčkoj ona upoznaje tajanstvenoga Beckera (Skarsgard) i on njezinu odlučnost stavlja na kušnju. Brzo postane jasno da je lažno prikazao svoje namjere i uvlači je u zamršene planove vrhunskoga špijuna Kurtza (Shannon). Charlie se upušta u zahtjevnu ulogu dvostruke agentice u "životnoj predstavi". No iako je prirodno nadarena za taj zadatak, neizbježno biva uvučena u opasni svijet dvoličnosti i kompromitirane ljudskosti. "Mala bubnjarica" isprepleće ljubav i mržnju, istinito i izmišljeno, ispravno i pogrešno te ispreda napetu i eksplozivnu priču o špijunaži i međunarodnim intrigama na najvišoj razini.</desc>

I cannot for the life of me understand why so many people don't like this movie - personally, I'd have to say it's one of the best movies I've seen.\n\nI wouldn't want to go too much in detail about it, suffice it to say I think it's good there are still movies made where use of one's brain is actually required when watching it, and everything is not over-explained. And finally, I'm astonished to see that so many didn't understand who Seigner's character actually was. To me, it was clear as day, _especially_ after seeing that last engraving.

I remember when Jack Nicholson was first cast as the Joker for Tim Burton's Batman. Nicholson's portrayal was just what was expected from such a great actor in a signature role. But it was NO MORE than we expected from him. In a way, one could say it fell a little flat. Well, I feel that way about The Wolfman. First, Anthony Hopkins, one of the consistently best actors out there, gave the exact performance I would expect from him, commanding respect both as an actor and as the character he played. But it was nothing we haven't seen already. Reminiscent of Meet Joe Black or Fracture or Instinct. I'm also a fan of Benicio Del Toro, but his brooding and emotional performance was exactly what I went to the theater to see. I didn't see anything more. The same could be said for the script, a very straightforward storyline that was a bit predictable and sort of tired. On one hand, I commend the film makers for not overdoing the story with convoluted twists in an effort to be "original." But again, I wasn't surprised by anything in the storyline at all.\n\nI was anxious to see this film, and overall I was very pleased with the cinematography, the performances of the cast and of course the special effects. But I did not leave the theater saying "WOW, that was even better than I expected!" like I had hoped I would.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":105491,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2010-02-24","keywords":"werewolf,asylum,full moon,lawrence larry talbot character,skipping a stone","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Wolfman: Official Super Bowl Spot ","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi824312857","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyOTA3NTc1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTUxNDIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyOTA3NTc1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTUxNDIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Wolfman: Official Super Bowl Spot "},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001125/","name":"Benicio Del Toro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1289434/","name":"Emily Blunt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002653/","name":"Joe Johnston"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0235528/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001825/","name":"Andrew Kevin Walker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0783100/","name":"David Self"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0802561/","name":"Curt Siodmak"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I remember when Jack Nicholson was first cast as the Joker for Tim Burton's Batman. Nicholson's portrayal was just what was expected from such a great actor in a signature role. But it was NO MORE than we expected from him. In a way, one could say it fell a little flat. Well, I feel that way about The Wolfman. First, Anthony Hopkins, one of the consistently best actors out there, gave the exact performance I would expect from him, commanding respect both as an actor and as the character he played. But it was nothing we haven't seen already. Reminiscent of Meet Joe Black or Fracture or Instinct. I'm also a fan of Benicio Del Toro, but his brooding and emotional performance was exactly what I went to the theater to see. I didn't see anything more. The same could be said for the script, a very straightforward storyline that was a bit predictable and sort of tired. On one hand, I commend the film makers for not overdoing the story with convoluted twists in an effort to be "original." But again, I wasn't surprised by anything in the storyline at all.\n\nI was anxious to see this film, and overall I was very pleased with the cinematography, the performances of the cast and of course the special effects. But I did not leave the theater saying "WOW, that was even better than I expected!" like I had hoped I would.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":105491,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2010-02-24","keywords":"werewolf,asylum,full moon,lawrence larry talbot character,skipping a stone","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Wolfman: Official Super Bowl Spot ","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi824312857","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyOTA3NTc1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTUxNDIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyOTA3NTc1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTUxNDIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Wolfman: Official Super Bowl Spot ","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001125/","name":"Benicio Del Toro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1289434/","name":"Emily Blunt"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002653/","name":"Joe Johnston"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0235528/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001825/","name":"Andrew Kevin Walker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0783100/","name":"David Self","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0802561/","name":"Curt Siodmak"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As Starling works under the demeaning supervision of Agent Krendler, Lecter begins to taunt her with letters from an unknown location. Meanwhile in Florence, Inspector Pazzi begins to suspect the identity of the new curator, while Verger places a $3million reward for anyone who will bring him information leading to Lecter.\n\nThe sequel that everyone wanted to see and that got lots of headlines for it's gory content was not something I was very bothered about seeing. Although I think Silence was a good film I was a bit surprised by the sheer volume and degree of praise that was heaped upon it. However I decided I would give it a go when it finally came on television and I pretty much got what I expected  a gory film that trades on blood and it's title character without a great deal else of real value put in with it. The story is very condensed from the book (so I'm told anyway) and is basically boiled down to a handful of events that will deliver the shock and gore if that's all you want  but that's not all I wanted. I needed a lot more in fact and I have a better appreciation of what made the first film a much better one than this.\n\nFor one thing the whole film lacks suspense  by which I mean real suspense and tension, not just the suspense as we await the imminent arrive of the next gory scene. The plot is a little bit daffy at points and this may be done to it's slimmed down nature  certainly I was not drawn in so much as merely standing by watching it. The film also asks a lot of us; it asks us to understand the relationship dynamic between Lecter and Starling even though it shows us very little here  almost like it is expecting us just to take it on face value and remember Silence without it carrying anything through. Also it asked us to like, even support, Lecter  an idea that I found wholly unappealing. There is nothing wrong with having a monster as your 'hero' character or of focusing on the dark side of humanity but here the film practically revels in the gore, almost forgetting all else. It has made Lecter such a comical character ('okay-dokay'?) that it doesn't really know what to do with itself when he is off screen. The fact that it doesn't do anything with this dark beast other than stare lovingly at him is a problem for me and just supported the idea that the film was out for gore.\n\nEven the cast seem to realize that this film is nowhere near the caliber of Silence and they all seem to have their tongue in their cheeks with their performances. Hopkins seems to relish the chance to overplay in a big payday for him (the film could happen without Foster but not without him). His character is so much more played for fun than in Silence and this damages the tension, but Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself nonetheless. Moore plays it totally straight and doesn't have much fun  she is good but she doesn't stand out even if she does replace Foster well. An unrecognisable Oldman also hams it up but keeps his character just this side of silly Ivanek supports Oldman well but is obviously eclipsed by the latter's showy role. Giannini is good in his minor role and is lucky to escape the script's excesses; sadly Liotta is not free and his performance towards the end matches the absurdity of the plot in his regard.\n\nOverall this is a big fancy horror movie but it is far from the standard of Silence. It lacks real bite (sorry) in terms of tension and excitement and it replaces it with a series of increasingly gory set pieces. If all you want is superficial delivery then this is worth seeing as it is enjoyable as a gory horror but it is no more than that and fans of the mood and atmosphere of Silence Of The Lambs will feel a little cheated."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-03-14","keywords":"hannibal lecter,police,cannibal,pistol,villain played by lead actor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hannibal","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1300339481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3YjRlMDUtMDQ2YS00MTIyLTk1NWUtNDhhOTlhMTA2ZTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM/UA"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365383/","name":"Thomas Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000519/","name":"David Mamet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001873/","name":"Steven Zaillian"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-03-08","keywords":"playing a board game,sibling rivalry,board game,two brothers,outer space","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Zathura","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1608712473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MmYyZTAtZGVkNC00NWQzLWE4OGEtNmNmNGM0OWY1ZDNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MmYyZTAtZGVkNC00NWQzLWE4OGEtNmNmNGM0OWY1ZDNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1242688/","name":"Josh Hutcherson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1501050/","name":"Jonah Bobo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1009277/","name":"Dax Shepard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0269463/","name":"Jon Favreau"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060719/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0885575/","name":"Chris Van Allsburg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436960/","name":"John Kamps"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018. \n\n No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting. \n\n Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. "Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much.\n\n Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.   Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch).\n\n Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car "why can't you just drive us where we need to go?" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is.\n\n Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with "I'm just saying you're a babe." Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short.\n\n These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":352586,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-12-20","keywords":"jungle,trapped in a game,title based on song,song in title,high school","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3413817625","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four teenagers discover an old video game console and are literally drawn into the game's jungle setting becoming the adult avatars they choose."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2394794/","name":"Karen Gillan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366389/","name":"Kevin Hart"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440458/","name":"Jake Kasdan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332017/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003298/","name":"Scott Rosenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018. \n\n No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting. \n\n Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. "Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much.\n\n Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.   Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch).\n\n Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car "why can't you just drive us where we need to go?" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is.\n\n Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with "I'm just saying you're a babe." Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short.\n\n These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":352586,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-12-20","keywords":"jungle,trapped in a game,title based on song,song in title,high school","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3413817625","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four teenagers discover an old video game console and are literally drawn into the game's jungle setting becoming the adult avatars they choose.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2394794/","name":"Karen Gillan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366389/","name":"Kevin Hart"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440458/","name":"Jake Kasdan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332017/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003298/","name":"Scott Rosenberg"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

We find humour in the least-expected of places, we find heart in the least-expected of people, and 'Moneyball" gives us a completely enjoyable movie that becomes so much more than numbers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399728,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2011-09-23","keywords":"strategy,baseball,statistics,baseball movie,job offer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3229326361","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM1NDMxMTI3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAzODY1Ng@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM1NDMxMTI3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAzODY1Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) works to put together a baseball club on a budget by employing computer-generated analysis to draft his players.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000705/","name":"Robin Wright","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706767/","name":"Jonah Hill"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587955/","name":"Bennett Miller"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174505/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001873/","name":"Steven Zaillian","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3133181/","name":"Stan Chervin"],"duration":"PT2H13M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Director Eli Roth has made a tricky movie here, with a lot of seemingly harmless buildup leading to a crescendo of visceral terror and anguish. The three western tourists are likable, young males out for a bit of fun. They are oblivious to the trap into which they've fallen. Hell has to literally open up around them before they take notice.\n\nPart horror / cautionary tale, part sadistic blast of jet-black humor, and part social / political commentary, Roth builds the story slowly, revealing the truth in one big, shocking switch. The motivation behind the ordeal is what places this movie a step above typical, so-called "torture porn". It's ingenious really, in a sort of cynical, demonic way. Not for the squeamish or the easily offended...","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":176044,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2006-01-06","keywords":"torture,travel,female nudity,tied to a chair,sadistic murderer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hostel","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi462422297","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmUyNjBlOWQtOWFhOC00N2RhLTg5ODUtNTJlZmUwMGE0MTBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmUyNjBlOWQtOWFhOC00N2RhLTg5ODUtNTJlZmUwMGE0MTBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Lionsgate","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379596/","name":"Jay Hernandez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1277177/","name":"Derek Richardson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1898448/","name":"Eythor Gudjonsson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744834/","name":"Eli Roth"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070371/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0116469/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028556/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744834/","name":"Eli Roth"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":546035,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2007-05-01","keywords":"villain,peter parker character,alien parasite,alien symbiote,coffeeshop","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spider-Man 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi826343961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGYzNWJlMDEtM2MwOS00NTA3LThjMWItYmIzZjQ0MzI4MDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGYzNWJlMDEtM2MwOS00NTA3LThjMWItYmIzZjQ0MzI4MDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this third installment in the superhero film series"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001497/","name":"Tobey Maguire"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0333410/","name":"Topher Grace"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000600/","name":"Sam Raimi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000600/","name":"Sam Raimi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0706898/","name":"Ivan Raimi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765091/","name":"Alvin Sargent"}],"duration":"PT2H19M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":546035,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2007-05-01","keywords":"villain,peter parker character,alien parasite,alien symbiote,coffeeshop","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spider-Man 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi826343961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGYzNWJlMDEtM2MwOS00NTA3LThjMWItYmIzZjQ0MzI4MDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGYzNWJlMDEtM2MwOS00NTA3LThjMWItYmIzZjQ0MzI4MDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this third installment in the superhero film series","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001497/","name":"Tobey Maguire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0333410/","name":"Topher Grace"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000600/","name":"Sam Raimi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000600/","name":"Sam Raimi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0706898/","name":"Ivan Raimi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765091/","name":"Alvin Sargent"],"duration":"PT2H19M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

People need that.\n\nThe second Amazing Spider-Man movie, and it was pretty amazing for me. Electro is probably the best Spider-Man villain, not in terms of characterization, but in terms of coolness and power. That last fight scene was so dope with the electricity that made all the music. Blue is a great color for Electro. He is also very powerful, and he definitely could have done more than in the movie.\n\nAndrew Garfield again brought charisma to the our favorite local superhero. And just like in the first, Peter and Gwen had such amazing charm and chemistry, only because of the actors.\n\nMy problem is although they revealed more about Peter's parents, it kinda led to nothing. I was quite disappointed in that. Then, Harry Osborn was pretty boring and just rushed.\n\nOverall, it was just slightly better than the other Spider-Man (of course not even close to Spider-Man 2) because of a cooler villain. 7.5/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":461310,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-05-02","keywords":"secret identity,returning character killed off,death of girlfriend,costumed hero,superhero","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi694921753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwODUyNzM3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU5OTI0MTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwODUyNzM3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU5OTI0MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the final trailer for The Amazing Spider-Man 2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1940449/","name":"Andrew Garfield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004937/","name":"Jamie Foxx"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1989536/","name":"Marc Webb"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0180492/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0476064/","name":"Alex Kurtzman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0649460/","name":"Roberto Orci"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684374/","name":"Jeff Pinkner"}],"duration":"PT2H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

People need that.\n\nThe second Amazing Spider-Man movie, and it was pretty amazing for me. Electro is probably the best Spider-Man villain, not in terms of characterization, but in terms of coolness and power. That last fight scene was so dope with the electricity that made all the music. Blue is a great color for Electro. He is also very powerful, and he definitely could have done more than in the movie.\n\nAndrew Garfield again brought charisma to the our favorite local superhero. And just like in the first, Peter and Gwen had such amazing charm and chemistry, only because of the actors.\n\nMy problem is although they revealed more about Peter's parents, it kinda led to nothing. I was quite disappointed in that. Then, Harry Osborn was pretty boring and just rushed.\n\nOverall, it was just slightly better than the other Spider-Man (of course not even close to Spider-Man 2) because of a cooler villain. 7.5/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":461310,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-05-02","keywords":"secret identity,returning character killed off,death of girlfriend,costumed hero,superhero","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi694921753","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwODUyNzM3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU5OTI0MTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwODUyNzM3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU5OTI0MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the final trailer for The Amazing Spider-Man 2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1940449/","name":"Andrew Garfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004937/","name":"Jamie Foxx"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1989536/","name":"Marc Webb"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0180492/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0476064/","name":"Alex Kurtzman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0649460/","name":"Roberto Orci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684374/","name":"Jeff Pinkner"],"duration":"PT2H22M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Kreće od trenutka kad je Wolf pobjegao od Tiger i pratimo njegov munjevit uspon od skromnog slastičara do super kulinarske zvijezde '80-ih. Ali njegov je uspjeh gorko-slatkog okusa, jer je ostavio jedinu osobu s kojom je sve to najviše htio podijeliti: Tiger. U njegov je život ušla droga, zbog koje je i ostao bez života, u kojemu je bilo i novca i djevojaka, ali najviše mu je nedostajala ljubav. Vidimo ga u raciji koja je dovela do njegove smrti - samo ga sada Tiger i Josh izvuku i povuku natrag u budućnost.</desc>

U ovoj epizodi pratimo uspon i pad Wolfa, iliti Coreyja Wolf-Harta, iliti Little Toe (Mali Prst). Kreće od trenutka kad je Wolf pobjegao od Tiger i pratimo njegov munjevit uspon od skromnog slastičara do super kulinarske zvijezde '80-ih. Ali njegov je uspjeh gorko-slatkog okusa, jer je ostavio jedinu osobu s kojom je sve to najviše htio podijeliti: Tiger. U njegov je život ušla droga, zbog koje je i ostao bez života, u kojemu je bilo i novca i djevojaka, ali najviše mu je nedostajala ljubav. Vidimo ga u raciji koja je dovela do njegove smrti - samo ga sada Tiger i Josh izvuku i povuku natrag u budućnost.</desc>

Yes, it's a bit over the top but I couldn't get enough and wish there was more. I am Spanish so speak the language but since I was born here I often needed to refer to the subtitles which was a bit annoying because I didn't want to tear my eyes away from the action. So, I understand the hesitance to watch a subtitled show but it is worth it! If you love shows like Downton Abbey or The Paradise, Watch the first episode of Gran Hotel and you will be hooked...ENJOY! P.S. This is a show made in Spain, not to be confused with "The Grand" which was a very good British variation, but not as good as "Gran Hotel".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10038,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2011-10-04","keywords":"telenovela,spain,timeframe 1900s","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654841/","name":"Adriana Ozores"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2319146/","name":"Amaia Salamanca"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2304398/","name":"Yon González"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0249391/"}]}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Yes, it's a bit over the top but I couldn't get enough and wish there was more. I am Spanish so speak the language but since I was born here I often needed to refer to the subtitles which was a bit annoying because I didn't want to tear my eyes away from the action. So, I understand the hesitance to watch a subtitled show but it is worth it! If you love shows like Downton Abbey or The Paradise, Watch the first episode of Gran Hotel and you will be hooked...ENJOY! P.S. This is a show made in Spain, not to be confused with "The Grand" which was a very good British variation, but not as good as "Gran Hotel".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10038,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2011-10-04","keywords":"telenovela,spain,timeframe 1900s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654841/","name":"Adriana Ozores","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2319146/","name":"Amaia Salamanca","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2304398/","name":"Yon González"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0249391/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I thought that the dialogue was excellent, on point, intelligent and well thought out; but I don't believe that the story went anywhere, it was a bit meandering, somewhat like this review!.

What would on surface seem unfilmable is done with great sensitivity and honesty.\n\nCondon knows how to tell stories about real people (Gods and Monsters), and here is a life filled with curiosity and far reaching accomplishment.\n\nRaised in a repressed family dominated by a stern father, Kinsey is portrayed as an isolated teen who rebels against not only his father, but against sexual convention. As a science instructor in college, he meets a student who becomes his wife. As other students look more and more to him for sexual advice, his original interest in insect studies changes to sex adviser and ultimately sex researcher. His team of assistants and even their wives become involved in the research.

What would on surface seem unfilmable is done with great sensitivity and honesty.\n\nCondon knows how to tell stories about real people (Gods and Monsters), and here is a life filled with curiosity and far reaching accomplishment.\n\nRaised in a repressed family dominated by a stern father, Kinsey is portrayed as an isolated teen who rebels against not only his father, but against sexual convention. As a science instructor in college, he meets a student who becomes his wife. As other students look more and more to him for sexual advice, his original interest in insect studies changes to sex adviser and ultimately sex researcher. His team of assistants and even their wives become involved in the research. As Kinsey's study requires sample interviews across the country, a diverse, amazing discovery of sexual habits and statistics are revealed. The study ultimately becomes published in a groundbreaking best seller amid a swell of damnation from the public.\n\nCondon interweaves the science with the human element in a very intelligent screenplay.

And with the help of her best friend (Cheryl Hines), she tries to keep up with the lie for nine months. Lindsay Lohan is back, and she delivers a very good performance here, this movie is very funny, i laughed out loud a few times. It's definitely not theater material but it still worth it on a Saturday night on TV with your friends, just forget the fact that Lindsay is in it, it's a very cute movie.\n\nNow i can't wait to see Lindsay again in The Other Side, it's gonna be so much better than this movie.

Dramatizations are at their best when actual footage of the subject or event doesn't exist. They can be an effective way to highlight a particularly interesting story or person with details we might not otherwise access. Richard Kuklinski's story is fascinating and frightening. He is known as the mob's most prolific hit-man/contract killer. Writer/director Arial Vromen has adapted Anthony Bruno's novel for the screen, and wisely cast Michael Shannon in the lead. It makes a nice companion piece to the chilling 1992 documentary The Iceman Tapes: Conversations with a Killer.\n\nThe movie is dominated by the hulking presence of Shannon as Richard Kuklinski. Shannon is no match for the physical size of Kuklinski, but his movements and the camera angles capture the powerful and imposing monster that he was. If you are unfamiliar with Kuklinski's story, he killed somewhere between 100-250 people. His missions were carried forth in cold-blooded, heartless and widely disparate manners. Additionally, he often dismembered his victims and froze bodies and parts to prevent the actual time of death from being established. He was good at his job, but hardly a good guy. But wait! Not so fast ...\n\nKuklinski was also a husband a father of two daughters who made up what appeared to be a lovely, normal family in suburban New Jersey. This guy had an internal switch he flipped from the street to the dining room table. When he was captured, his wife and daughter claimed they had no clue what he did for a living (he had told them he was in Finance). Sure, they admitted to his having a wild temper and even threatening his wife a few times, but they never once considered that he was a cold-blooded killer by day and neighborly barbecue dad on weekends.\n\nWinona Ryder plays Deborah, Kuklinski's wife. Before you roll your eyes, you should know that Ryder is exceptional in the role. Her tease in Black Swan gave us hope she had returned to form, but this turn displays the talent we always knew was there. The always dependable and creepy Ray Liotta is perfectly cast as Roy Demeo, the mobster for whom Kuklinski worked. The scenes with Shannon and Liotta together are bone-chillingly frightening. Chris Evans (light years from Captain America) plays fellow hit-man Robert Prongay aka Mr Freezy. Kuklinski credits Prongay with valuable insight into poison and disposal of bodies. It's heart-warming to see that even contract killers have support groups. Other support work comes courtesy of David Schwimmer as Josh (Demeo's right hand man), Robert Davi (as Leonard Marks. Demeo's link to the family head), James Franco (as one of the hits), and Stephen Dorff as Kuklinski's incarcerated brother Joey.\n\nChildhood flashbacks give us the table-setting necessary to understand the balance of nature v nurture in the Kuklinski household. Still, no matter how much abuse or misery one has a child, it's difficult to comprehend the stoic evil that possessed Kuklinski. And to be clear, Michael Shannon's performance is his best yet ... and that is saying a great deal. He has become one of the most interesting actors - one who can take the lead as he does here and in Take Shelter, or as a scene-stealing supporter in Revolutionary Road, Mud and the upcoming Man of Steel (as General Zod). He's not a flashy actor, just an extremely talented one.\n\nVromen captures the gritty feel of the nearly three decades of "family" life in a manner that reminds of Kill the Irishmen ... the Ray Stevenson take on Danny Greene. The atmosphere and inner turmoil are similar, but there is no comparison the Kuklinski evil. Should you doubt this, I would highly recommend the documentary previously mentioned. Watching the actual dead eyes of the real Richard Kuklinski as he talks about his life is beyond horrifying.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":73610,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-05-02","keywords":"based on true story,contract killer,murder of a girl,crime family,gambino crime family","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4147750681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1MTcxMTY1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE4MTUyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1MTcxMTY1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE4MTUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The true story of Richard Kuklinski, the notorious contract killer and family man.

Matter of fact, the movie stands out pretty well through Aniston's filmography. The story is not complicated, runs smooth and gets your attention. The story revolves around Wally Mars (Jason Bateman) a middle-age single guy who has a hard-time finding his match and Kassie Larson (Jennifer Aniston), his best-friend. At Kassie's semen-party, Wally gets drunk and switches the donator's sperm with his own without realizing and forgetting completely about what happened to next day. After seven years of being separated by distance Kassie movies back to her town and of course, she starts to talk again to her "best-friend". Problems appear only when Wally sees that Kassie's kid is acting pretty much similar like him so he remembers what he did and decides to tell Kassie the truth. Of course, this story has it's clichés and I'm the most bored person on the earth by clichés but this movie is a little bit different. It's not that funny, it has it's funny moments which were handled well but the movie it-self is more of a romance than a comedy so I enjoyed it more than others who expected a million laughs from it.\n\nAs far as the acting, this is definitely Aniston's best movie this year and I liked her attitude in this even though she portrays almost the same character but it's such an improvement from The Bounty Hunter. Jason Bateman was very good, hilarious at points as usual and actually approached a more serious tone for this role. The rest was good and I really was not bothered by anything at all. The characters were lovely and I was surprised for them to not look over-acted and exaggerated.\n\nThe cinematography, editing were pretty much normal, nothing to be mentioned and the score was as usual, typical for a romantic movie. With all these I want to say that this movie is not BAD and I don't understand people who love to bash this movie just for it's clichés and stuff like that. This movie is a simple good time for a boring afternoon.

Writer/Director John Michael McDonagh is the brother of Martin McDonagh, who brought us the excellent In Bruges (which also starred Brendan Gleeson). I figured it best to say that upfront because there is no way to avoid comparisons of the two films. Clearly these men grew up in the same house and were trained in a brilliant method of writing dialogue.\n\nBrendan Gleeson delivers a powerful and hilarious performance as a local cop (Garda) in rural Ireland. His Sgt Gerry Boyle is quite an enigma - he gets along great with locals, yet struggles to fit into society. This is never more apparent than when FBI Agent Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle) hits town on a drug smuggling investigation. The key to their relationship is crystallized at the moment an exasperated Agent Everett says to Boyle, 'I can't tell if you are really smart or really dumb'. Of course, I am paraphrasing because the F-word gets literally worn out in this movie. There aren't many lines I can actually quote in print. But the word rolls off Gleeson's tongue as if it's a work of art ... especially in conversation with his ailing mother, played well by the always terrific Fionnula Flanagan.\n\nThe international drug smugglers being chased are a trio led by Liam Cunningham and the always interesting Mark Strong. The endless rips, insults and jokes are fired rapidly at Americans, Brits and anyone unfortunate enough to hail from Dublin. Boyle uses his Irish background as a crutch for his racism and insensitivity. But he leaves no doubt about his expertise as a cop. Heck he even recognizes the importance of some 9 year old kid riding around on a pink bicycle. That's just another example of the off-center approach to story telling offered by McDonagh.\n\nIf you are a fan of In Bruges, Snatch, or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, I think you will enjoy this one. It falls just short of that level, but not by much. Gleeson is outstanding and the story is simple enough, yet with plenty of twist, turns and hilarity.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":84668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-07-07","keywords":"small town,drug smuggling,galway ireland,mother son relationship,ireland","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Guard - International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3330710553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4MjI4OTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE5MTc3NQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4MjI4OTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE5MTc3NQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An unorthodox Irish policeman with a confrontational personality is teamed up with an uptight FBI agent to investigate an international drug-smuggling ring."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322407/","name":"Brendan Gleeson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000332/","name":"Don Cheadle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0835016/","name":"Mark Strong"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0567620/","name":"John Michael McDonagh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0137061/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0214624/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126667/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0567620/","name":"John Michael McDonagh"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The script has the same horrible dialogue that so many low-b films have. I wanted to like this film coming out the gates but as the minutes rolled by, I realized that I was wasting my time.\n\nA discovery. Something cosmic about said discovery. Disagreement on how to handle the discovery. Government (or in this case a University) wants to hide and control the discovery. Sadly, the entire film is about the arguing of the discovery rather than exploring the discovery. Seriously!\n\nThis film is a lot of the same that we've seen in so many other small films yet nothing new or interesting. Watch at your own risk, the risk of wasting your time. the good news is that after watching this film, I quickly began to forget what I had just watched, so almost as if it had never happened.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":312,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5,"genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-07-16","keywords":"australian aliens,australian supernatural,australian science fiction","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0108725/","name":"Don Bridges","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0205897/","name":"Paul Dawber","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8622440/","name":"Boris Granolic"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2721562/","name":"Nathan Dalton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0756013/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0534397/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2721562/","name":"Nathan Dalton"],"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

During his missions he still works too much as a soldier. The CIA does not get the necessary information and decides to use JJ for undercover operation. JJ now has to spy on mother Kate (Parise Fitz-Henley) and her young daughter Sophie (Chloe Coleman) in the hope that her arms trade partner contacts his family. JJ is soon discovered by the clever nine-year-old Sophie, who promises to share nothing about his secret mission with the rest of the world. In return, JJ has to train her on how to become a spy herself.\n\nThis movie has his amusing moments about how a young girl can outsmart a novice CIA agent. This aspect has come up before in other films such as the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Kindergarden Cop. For people familiar with such films, this film can quickly become predictable. The script clearly shows the bond between JJ and young Sophie, but the film concentrates a bit too much on this band at a time. For example, the aspect of the secret arms trade is somewhat canceled. The scenes that pass here seem a bit like separate scenes from a completely different film.

During his missions he still works too much as a soldier. The CIA does not get the necessary information and decides to use JJ for undercover operation. JJ now has to spy on mother Kate (Parise Fitz-Henley) and her young daughter Sophie (Chloe Coleman) in the hope that her arms trade partner contacts his family. JJ is soon discovered by the clever nine-year-old Sophie, who promises to share nothing about his secret mission with the rest of the world. In return, JJ has to train her on how to become a spy herself.\n\nThis movie has his amusing moments about how a young girl can outsmart a novice CIA agent. This aspect has come up before in other films such as the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Kindergarden Cop. For people familiar with such films, this film can quickly become predictable. The script clearly shows the bond between JJ and young Sophie, but the film concentrates a bit too much on this band at a time. For example, the aspect of the secret arms trade is somewhat canceled. The scenes that pass here seem a bit like separate scenes from a completely different film. These different aspects only come together at the end of the film, but otherwise seem to have little in common.\n\nThe comedy moments are also somewhat predictable if you are familiar with these kinds of comedy movies.

With George Clooney at the helm of Suburbicon (2017) many expected something special but instead are using much less charitable words. The almost unanimous condemnation of this film is difficult to fathom. When a movie is so widely panned it means either it is a disaster or that it pricks a collective raw nerve somewhere, for some reason. This movie is not a disaster.\n\nControversially, the film comprises two apparently unrelated plot lines, part of which is based on a true story.  Set in 1950s middle class America, Suburbicon was a peaceful all-white neighbourhood until the African-American Mayers family moved in. The white community objects and the local progress association builds a fence to wall off the newcomers. Community anger escalates until permanent crowds are stationed outside the new family's home, harassing them to the point of violence, television coverage, and police intervention. This background story inter-cuts to a neighbouring family, the Gardners, who are in the middle of a home invasion. Two thugs tie up then chloroform the family, in the process killing Mrs Gardner (Julianne Moore). Soon her twin sister Margaret (also Julianne Moore) moves in to be with widower Lodge Gardner (Matt Damon) and son Nicky (Noah Jupe). It is not long before questions are asked why the loving husband doubled the life insurance on his wife. Mafia connections, an insurance fraud assessor, and a police investigator start lifting the lid of this perfect Suburbicon family. The two separate story lines are narratively linked only by Nicky and the Mayers son becoming baseball friends.\n\nThis is a brave way to frame a movie. Either storyline is enough to power an entire movie but running both in parallel appears muddled and narratively diffuse. However, if the viewer's frame of reference is raised to the overarching level of conservative white American values, then both stories are intensified by their contrast with the other. Keeping the Mayers community racism story in the background and the Gardners domestic crime story in the foreground makes the audience complicit in a glaring social injustice. The Mayers are anonymous, passive victims who are barely seen while we see much of the angry white mob who self-righteously claim the right to live in a white America.  Although the general trajectory of both stories is predictable, there are enough twists and turns to keep the tension rising until the film's finale. Across both stories, there is little subtlety or nuance, and the heavy-handed and obvious symbolism is the film's greatest fault. But for Hollywood cinema, that is not a hanging offence.\n\nThis dark comedic drama is engaging and entertaining. It captures the tones, fashions, and décor of the era, and the acting relies on stereotypes rather than character development. None of the characters compel emotional investment, so the space is left open for the action to do the talking. Filming coincided with the 2016 American election and Clooney likes his films to make political statements.  Calling this one a failure is rhetorical hyperbole. It is an audacious and innovative approach to telling a bigger story that just won't go away.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":43012,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-10-27","keywords":"murder,riot,peanut butter and jelly sandwich,satire,wheelchair","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3876829465","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4MDgwMTkzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ3NzgyMzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4MDgwMTkzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ3NzgyMzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Suburbicon is a peaceful, idyllic suburban community with affordable homes and manicured lawns... the perfect place to raise a family, and in the summer of 1959, the Lodge family is doing just that.

He embarks on an adventure with a street-smart girl to discover how he came to be.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt3922818/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"TVholic"},"dateCreated":"2019-08-11","inLanguage":"English","name":"Good sci-fi romance","reviewBody":"This movie was fine. It's no masterpiece, but I actually found it much more enjoyable than "The Martian," the vaunted 2015 Matt Damon vehicle. That may be somewhat more scientifically accurate - although it still had its share of errors - but it just used people as setpieces for the situation, with no real character development.\n\nI liked Asa Butterfield as the eponymous character in "Ender's Game," and he's just as good here. Before you tag me as an Asa fan, I didn't like him in Scorsese's "Hugo." Here, he was convincing as a Mars-born child with his childlike, guileless naiveté and tall, gangly build. One professional critic compared this with "Flight of the Navigator," but Gardner isn't the smartmouth kid like David was in that movie, and Asa is a far, far better actor than Joey Cramer was. Likewise Gary Oldman, some of whose roles I have detested (his Doctor Smith in the awful "Lost in Space") while others like his Commissioner Gordon in Nolan's Batman movies were fine. The critics think he was over the top as billionaire mogul Nathaniel Shepard, but I found him to be a rather plausible mix of Steve Jobs' salesmanship, Elon Musk's arrogance and spaceflight ambitions, and Howard Hughes' fascination with flying and reclusive eccentricity.\n\nYou can tell that many of the movie's fiercest critics here have their own agendas, usually trying to prove they're smarter than the writer. All their comments do is reveal their closed minds and often their ignorance. One smart aleck claims Gardner's mother looked 5 months pregnant in the film. The shot where she peers out of the spacecraft window as she cradles her expanding belly was at an indeterminate time sometime after her sonogram two months after launch, possibly right before landing more than seven months after launch. Same person talks about Mars gravity being 2/3rd of Earth's. No, it's 1/3rd. Plus she complains that the Earth's resources are said to be depleted. That phrase was Nathaniel reading from a letter he wrote to the President as a 12-year-old, full of youthful enthusiasm and exaggeration, not stated as actual scientific fact. Another critic tries to look intelligent by saying Mars is four light minutes away. It is at its closest, but the distance isn't constant and is over 22 light minutes at its furthest. (Another genius here claims it's 90 light minutes each way.) The communication with Mars was instantaneous because they clearly plastered "QuantumCom light minute compression" on the comm screens to imply they've figured out how to use quantum entanglement for instant data transfer at interplanetary distances (still inplausible as it's based on a common misconception, but still far less fantastical than laser swords, warp drive, time travel, telepathy, teleportation devices or humanoid aliens attacking to steal our water, oxygen, etc.). Besides, it's a dramatic technique, as waiting minutes between messages with no realtime interaction just isn't very interesting, unless you liked "You've Got Mail." Another critic who claims to be an MD rated the movie 1 star for no other reason than they pronounced a test "TROponin" rather than "tropPOnin" as he preferred, even though the former is in fact the correct pronunciation, as any medical dictionary can confirm. I wouldn't want him as my doctor, or even playing one on TV. One complained that Gardner's mother was too young to be a mission commander, but probably never said the same about the similarly young Jessica Chastain in "The Martian." Another smart guy claimed the spacecraft would have accelerated halfway to Mars, providing gravity all the way, then turned around and decelerated. Anybody with a knowledge of physics would laugh him out of the room after telling him that would require several times more reaction mass (fuel) than the total mass of the entire spacecraft, a physical impossibility. One critic savages the movie for having contemporary products in it. It's a relatively low budget science fiction film, not a $400 million blockbuster. They spent their budget on more important things like CGI effects, spacecraft props, Mars sets and weightlessness effects, not wasting it creating an entire future Earth, and the projections in movies set in the near future like "2001" always turn out looking dated after a few years anyway. You get the idea; the criticisms are generally incredibly petty, nitpicky and often just plain wrong. I can see plenty of scientific and technological mistakes, especially the Dream Chaser spacecraft used at the end, which would need a large booster and a launchpad rather than taking off using its own small rocket engines from a runway. But I accept that this is a movie, not a documentary, and focus on the characters, whom I did like and care about.\n\nBasically, the critiques boil down to "it's for kids!" As someone approaching retirement age, I'd much rather be young at heart than cranky and old in the head.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51310,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-02-03","keywords":"astronaut,futuristic,space mission,nasa,high school student","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4198413849","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2Mjg2NjYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwNjMwMTI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2Mjg2NjYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwNjMwMTI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The first human born on Mars travels to Earth for the first time, experiencing the wonders of the planet through fresh eyes.

It's no masterpiece, but I actually found it much more enjoyable than "The Martian," the vaunted 2015 Matt Damon vehicle. That may be somewhat more scientifically accurate - although it still had its share of errors - but it just used people as setpieces for the situation, with no real character development.\n\nI liked Asa Butterfield as the eponymous character in "Ender's Game," and he's just as good here. Before you tag me as an Asa fan, I didn't like him in Scorsese's "Hugo." Here, he was convincing as a Mars-born child with his childlike, guileless naiveté and tall, gangly build. One professional critic compared this with "Flight of the Navigator," but Gardner isn't the smartmouth kid like David was in that movie, and Asa is a far, far better actor than Joey Cramer was. Likewise Gary Oldman, some of whose roles I have detested (his Doctor Smith in the awful "Lost in Space") while others like his Commissioner Gordon in Nolan's Batman movies were fine. The critics think he was over the top as billionaire mogul Nathaniel Shepard, but I found him to be a rather plausible mix of Steve Jobs' salesmanship, Elon Musk's arrogance and spaceflight ambitions, and Howard Hughes' fascination with flying and reclusive eccentricity.\n\nYou can tell that many of the movie's fiercest critics here have their own agendas, usually trying to prove they're smarter than the writer. All their comments do is reveal their closed minds and often their ignorance. One smart aleck claims Gardner's mother looked 5 months pregnant in the film. The shot where she peers out of the spacecraft window as she cradles her expanding belly was at an indeterminate time sometime after her sonogram two months after launch, possibly right before landing more than seven months after launch. Same person talks about Mars gravity being 2/3rd of Earth's. No, it's 1/3rd. Plus she complains that the Earth's resources are said to be depleted. That phrase was Nathaniel reading from a letter he wrote to the President as a 12-year-old, full of youthful enthusiasm and exaggeration, not stated as actual scientific fact. Another critic tries to look intelligent by saying Mars is four light minutes away. It is at its closest, but the distance isn't constant and is over 22 light minutes at its furthest. (Another genius here claims it's 90 light minutes each way.) The communication with Mars was instantaneous because they clearly plastered "QuantumCom light minute compression" on the comm screens to imply they've figured out how to use quantum entanglement for instant data transfer at interplanetary distances (still inplausible as it's based on a common misconception, but still far less fantastical than laser swords, warp drive, time travel, telepathy, teleportation devices or humanoid aliens attacking to steal our water, oxygen, etc.).

It's the best of the bunch, even though that's not saying anything at all. It's also based on a French film "Mon frère se marie", and that's not really saying all that much either.\n\nAny description of the plot is just going to read as a listing of who's who of Hollywood. But let's do it anyways: We have the patriarch and matriarchs (Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton and Susan Sarandon); we have the up-and-comers excited for their big day (Ben Barnes and Amanda Seyfried); and then we have the middle siblings who have had their time in the spotlight and are starting to fade away (Topher Grace and Katherine Heigl).\n\nThe wedding revolves around lies (obviously) and religion - with Robin Williams as the drunken Catholic priest. And it also includes lots and lots of sex jokes. The surprising thing that audiences are taking away from this film, especially in spite of the decidedly negative critics' responses, is that it is hilarious. Fans of the film will find themselves laughing from beginning to end. But to give you fair warning, all of the jokes are sexually-based, and I mean all of them.\n\nLaughing at the Catholic stigma of don't have sex but if you do, don't be safe; laughing at people who have too much sex; laughing at people who don't have sex; and worse of all, laughing at divorced and married couples who have sex with one another.

It's the best of the bunch, even though that's not saying anything at all. It's also based on a French film "Mon frère se marie", and that's not really saying all that much either.\n\nAny description of the plot is just going to read as a listing of who's who of Hollywood. But let's do it anyways: We have the patriarch and matriarchs (Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton and Susan Sarandon); we have the up-and-comers excited for their big day (Ben Barnes and Amanda Seyfried); and then we have the middle siblings who have had their time in the spotlight and are starting to fade away (Topher Grace and Katherine Heigl).\n\nThe wedding revolves around lies (obviously) and religion - with Robin Williams as the drunken Catholic priest. And it also includes lots and lots of sex jokes. The surprising thing that audiences are taking away from this film, especially in spite of the decidedly negative critics' responses, is that it is hilarious. Fans of the film will find themselves laughing from beginning to end. But to give you fair warning, all of the jokes are sexually-based, and I mean all of them.\n\nLaughing at the Catholic stigma of don't have sex but if you do, don't be safe; laughing at people who have too much sex; laughing at people who don't have sex; and worse of all, laughing at divorced and married couples who have sex with one another. While some of the jokes were funny, they're also responsible for creating the uneasy dynamic amongst the characters – all of whom are family (or, at least, are about to become in-laws). At times the film crosses the line from funny dysfunctional family to repulsive dysfunctional family.\n\nThe one line that "The Big Wedding" straddles well is that between comedy and drama. The film is effective when it moves from funny jokes to touching family honesty and back to some more funny jokes. The story lines are very predictable, and sometimes the jokes are too simple and too wrong, but it tries to add in the right amount of drama, and ultimately, it should be entertaining to fans of the genre.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48976,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-04-26","keywords":"wedding,divorce,family relationships,farce,adoption","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2079761945","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDc2Mzk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk0MzEzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDc2Mzk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk0MzEzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"To the amusement of their adult children and friends, long divorced couple Don and Ellie Griffin are once again forced to play the happy couple for the sake of their adopted son's wedding after his ultra conservative biological mother unexpectedly decides to fly halfway across the world to attend.

Craig Zahler, who also wrote this gruesome, filthy western of how wild the west can really get. More so impressive that the whole film was shot in just 21 days. \n\nAn outlaw drifter wanders into the town of Bright Hope unknowingly leading a tribe of savage, inbred, natives better known as Troglodytes which translates as Cave-dweller." During the night, these horrific abominations murder and kidnap some of the town folk, one being the wife of a crippled rancher, who then embarks on a rescue mission with the town sheriff, his old and incapable deputy and an over confident gunslinger. \n\nKurt Russell heads up the rescue posse as Sheriff Hunt, slipping comfortably into his western boots. Richard Jenkins plays his ageing deputy, Patrick Wilson the limping, desperate rancher and an impressive Matthew Fox who stole the screen, as the charismatic, narcissistic know-it- all who both annoying yet strangely likable, reminding me a little of Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone. \n\nThere's an air of mystery for the majority of the film, keeping the audience on tender hooks waiting to see what's in store for the rescue party. Are the kidnapped still alive? Dead? Or worse? While some elements are left to your imagination, you can only think of the worse, but what isn't, is nothing short of disturbing.\n\nThe gory violence is shocking to watch, even just hearing the graphic noises is enough. The sound is gruesome, bloody and unsettling. The climatic end was actually painful to watch, scarring the memory making me shudder just at the thought of it. The lack of a score only intensifies the haunting atmosphere. \n\nSomething has to be said for the special effects, make-up and the sound engineering that were all completely on point. I've never seen a more gory western, even more so than The Hateful Eight. The makeup and effects throughout are amazing but they really go beyond during the epic climax. \n\nThere's been a few disturbing films this year, visually, Neon Demon and imagination wise, Nocturnal Animals springing to mind but this one really made me wrench covering my mouth with both hands. It's like those good horrors you're too scared to watch but find yourself mesmerised to the screen regardless. This is certainly not one for the weak stomached.

It's the best of the bunch, even though that's not saying anything at all. It's also based on a French film "Mon frère se marie", and that's not really saying all that much either.\n\nAny description of the plot is just going to read as a listing of who's who of Hollywood. But let's do it anyways: We have the patriarch and matriarchs (Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton and Susan Sarandon); we have the up-and-comers excited for their big day (Ben Barnes and Amanda Seyfried); and then we have the middle siblings who have had their time in the spotlight and are starting to fade away (Topher Grace and Katherine Heigl).\n\nThe wedding revolves around lies (obviously) and religion - with Robin Williams as the drunken Catholic priest. And it also includes lots and lots of sex jokes. The surprising thing that audiences are taking away from this film, especially in spite of the decidedly negative critics' responses, is that it is hilarious. Fans of the film will find themselves laughing from beginning to end. But to give you fair warning, all of the jokes are sexually-based, and I mean all of them.\n\nLaughing at the Catholic stigma of don't have sex but if you do, don't be safe; laughing at people who have too much sex; laughing at people who don't have sex; and worse of all, laughing at divorced and married couples who have sex with one another. While some of the jokes were funny, they're also responsible for creating the uneasy dynamic amongst the characters – all of whom are family (or, at least, are about to become in-laws). At times the film crosses the line from funny dysfunctional family to repulsive dysfunctional family.\n\nThe one line that "The Big Wedding" straddles well is that between comedy and drama. The film is effective when it moves from funny jokes to touching family honesty and back to some more funny jokes. The story lines are very predictable, and sometimes the jokes are too simple and too wrong, but it tries to add in the right amount of drama, and ultimately, it should be entertaining to fans of the genre.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48976,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-04-26","keywords":"wedding,divorce,family relationships,farce,adoption","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2079761945","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDc2Mzk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk0MzEzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDc2Mzk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk0MzEzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"To the amusement of their adult children and friends, long divorced couple Don and Ellie Griffin are once again forced to play the happy couple for the sake of their adopted son's wedding after his ultra conservative biological mother unexpectedly decides to fly halfway across the world to attend.

However, halfway through the plot suddenly goes completely bonkers and I'm struggling to figure out if the plot goes bonkers in a positive or negative way.\n\nThis movie is based on the story of Peter Pan, except it focuses on Wendy. The story follows Wendy and her twin brothers, James and Douglas, as they hop onto a train and end up on a magic island where kids don't age. However, things begin to get serious when Wendy learns of an old man on the island.\n\nI mentioned how the film starts out lacking substance. This issue is mostly due to the pacing, which is probably my biggest issue with the film. The scene where the kids get onto the train to the island feels like it comes out of nowhere, despite the fact that there is some build up. And even though it's established that Wendy seeks adventure, I don't really get the impression that she is ok with running away. Her sudden fascination with the train is confusing and feels like a scene or two that would further establish her adventurous and reckless side has been removed. The middle of the movie also feels like certain scenes were cut off too soon. For example, when Wendy and her brothers run into Thomas, a kid from their town who ran away to the island when Wendy was a baby, they question why Thomas looks exactly the same as when he disappeared, and then the scene immediately ends. And after that scene, they rarely interact with Thomas and instantly go back to playing. It feets odd to me that the kids seem to forget about the fact that they just reunited with a missing kid from their town and he hasn't aged a day.\n\nWhile the first half of the film feels very light on action, there's a very sudden shift in tone that honestly, made me uncomfortable, but in a good way. From that point forward, the film is a significantly more enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, I have issues with the ending. Obviously, I can't go into specifics, but let's just say that the ending raises more questions than answers. I don't have a problem with ambiguous endings, but when you're more confused because of said ambiguity, then I take issue.\n\nI rate this film 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 15. It came out in theatres on February 28th and the film is now out on digital.\n\nReviewed by Calista B., KIDS FIRST!

Santa Claus, as played as screen icon Mel Gibson, is not really "fat" as the title would imply, but Mel makes the character a badass. However, Chris has incurred the wrath of a thoroughly repugnant devil-child. Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield) is a rich 12 year old child whose nasty actions have motivated Chris to gift the kid with a lump of coal. But the kid retaliates by calling upon his favorite hitman (the great character actor Walton Goggins), and hiring him to assassinate Chris!\n\n"Fatman" was, for this viewer, an ingeniously twisted little tale that works hard to be edgy, and delivers some good dark comedy. Of course, it's far from being for all tastes, especially as we see that Billy is ready and willing to torture a schoolmate when she wins a science fair first prize that he feels should have been his. Fairly grim (but not overwhelmingly so), and very violent, the film also delivers some unexpected poignancy as Chris bemoans the state of the world today - and the bad attitudes of its children. Chris himself has fallen on such hard times that he enters into a temporary partnership with the U. S. military, where the elves will be making product other than toys.\n\nMel is in fine form, and he and the wonderful Marianne Jean-Baptiste make for a rather endearing Mr. And Mrs. Claus. Goggins is superb as the icy-cold, super-efficient hired killer who has his own reasons for wanting to bump off St. Nick. (One amusing character trait is that "Skinny Man"s' pet of choice is a hamster.)

Santa Claus, as played as screen icon Mel Gibson, is not really "fat" as the title would imply, but Mel makes the character a badass. However, Chris has incurred the wrath of a thoroughly repugnant devil-child. Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield) is a rich 12 year old child whose nasty actions have motivated Chris to gift the kid with a lump of coal. But the kid retaliates by calling upon his favorite hitman (the great character actor Walton Goggins), and hiring him to assassinate Chris!\n\n"Fatman" was, for this viewer, an ingeniously twisted little tale that works hard to be edgy, and delivers some good dark comedy. Of course, it's far from being for all tastes, especially as we see that Billy is ready and willing to torture a schoolmate when she wins a science fair first prize that he feels should have been his. Fairly grim (but not overwhelmingly so), and very violent, the film also delivers some unexpected poignancy as Chris bemoans the state of the world today - and the bad attitudes of its children. Chris himself has fallen on such hard times that he enters into a temporary partnership with the U. S. military, where the elves will be making product other than toys.\n\nMel is in fine form, and he and the wonderful Marianne Jean-Baptiste make for a rather endearing Mr. And Mrs. Claus. Goggins is superb as the icy-cold, super-efficient hired killer who has his own reasons for wanting to bump off St. Nick. (One amusing character trait is that "Skinny Man"s' pet of choice is a hamster.) Young Hurstfield is very, very good at creating a child character so despicable that you hate him from the word go.\n\nIn general, whatever problems the movie has are made up for by the entertaining story that provides an off-the-beaten path experience for those viewers who may be tired of "feel good" fare.\n\nEight out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21757,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2020-11-17","keywords":"christmas,santa claus character,post office,assassin,elf","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi830914841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"To save his declining business, Chris Cringle (Mel Gibson), also known as Santa Claus, is forced into a partnership with the U.S. military.

With an interesting framing carefully studying the movements and a steady hand for drawing a rather tense atmosphere, he builds up a story that catches you since the first sequence, jumping from a social drama to an unexpected thriller.\n\nEmbodied in a savage landscape, between town and pampas, this appealing and intriguing plot is carried by two main actors, the charismatic father, the great Chilean actor Alfredo Castro, and the young Martin López, whose magnetic presence will lead you along the story. Both represent two faces of eternal fight of 'good and evil' forces while you get trapped by rhythmic and hypnotic movements of malambo dancers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-09-23","keywords":"one word title,dancer,malambo,border crossing,father son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Karnawal - Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3224420633","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWJkMDUwYjUtMjZkNC00NGMzLTk3ZjktZGI2ODZlOWJmMTZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWJkMDUwYjUtMjZkNC00NGMzLTk3ZjktZGI2ODZlOWJmMTZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Karnawal - Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11488724/","name":"Martin Lopez Lacci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0998846/","name":"Alfredo Castro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0481946/","name":"Mónica Lairana"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8429856/","name":"Juan Pablo Félix"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0396528/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0794634/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305759/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8429856/","name":"Juan Pablo Félix"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

We've seen numerous examples of these contemplative films throughout the very existence of cinema stemming all the way back to Fritz Lang's haunting futuristic piece Metropolis and has inspired countless others in its thoughtful wake as seen in memorable cinematic creations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, and even Duncan Jones' Moon. Never to be a director to back away from experimental presentation or psychological study, Spike Jonze's Her fully embraces this reflective science-fiction quality by peering into the deep sociable aspects of the human psyche giving us more of a prophetical reality than a fictional reflection. In his latest film Jonze creates a disconcerting yet equally endearing romance between a secluded depressive and his female operating system with an evolving consciousness, basically a HAL-9000 homage from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, that brings to light a commentary on our dependency of programmed living and our need to maintain sociability when direct communication avenues have been stricken from life's normality. Rarely do ambitious films meet idyllically with their inquisitive potential, but Jonze has fashioned a delicately profound science-fiction contemplation that is depicted through the thoughtfulness of character alone that brims with wry humor, authentic pain, and charming revelation. Through the use of beautiful cinematography, impeccable production design, and subtle yet evocative performances, Her becomes a multilayered film experience where its character study of an isolated man afraid to become vulnerable again blends harmoniously with a truly unconventional yet naturally heartfelt romance. Jonze's affinity and ambition for presenting psychological challenges, as he has done before with Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and especially in Where the Wild Things Are, finally collides with emotionally piercing conveyance within Her making it as thought provoking and as it is undeniably sweet. If the sole purpose of the science-fiction genre is to expound on societal, moral, and deeply psychological aspects of our human condition than Her fits soundly within that genre's capabilities by capturing our condition's essential need for sociability and love uncomfortably linking it with our antisocial dependency on technology.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":577129,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-01-10","keywords":"loneliness,romance with artificial intelligence,divorce,future,artificial intelligence","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4112492569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3ODI3Nzg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY3NzQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3ODI3Nzg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY3NzQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":" A lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system that's designed to meet his every need.

The film that broke every box office record on release and wore the box office champion crown for many years(until it was overtaken by Jim Cameron's Avatar) is special because not only does it showcase the Titanic disaster in all its glory the film is a technical achievement of the highest order.

    <desc lang="hr">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: Directed by Michel Gondry. With Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Gerry Robert Byrne, Elijah Wood. When their relationship turns sour, a couple undergoes a medical procedure to have each other erased from their memories." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0338013/","name":"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NzcwODg3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEwOTMyMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When their relationship turns sour, a couple undergoes a medical procedure to have each other erased from their memories.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0338013/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"doctec"},"dateCreated":"2004-03-22","inLanguage":"English","name":"Interior Landscape","reviewBody":"Of all Kaufman's screenplays that delve into the interior landscapes of its characters, Eternal Sunshine is the most fully formed and moving story of the bunch, a rumination on the possibilities and consequences inherent in making the process of removing unwanted memories from your consciousness as easy as going for a checkup.  Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget the bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power to forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves.  At the very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again ("Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it"); at the worst, it eliminates the possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives and whose lives we shape through ours.\n\nThe film explores these ideas in a novel and engaging way: by taking the audience inside the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a man who, after breaking up with his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslett), discovers later that she has had her memory of him wiped clean from her mind.  He finds out how she had this procedure done and, despondent not only about the breakup but even more so about her having completely erased him from her mind, searches out the doctor who performed the procedure and signs up to have the same procedure done to him, so that he may also have no memory of her.  He is rendered unconscious for the procedure but his subconscious is still active.   Once the procedure is initiated and he becomes aware that his memories of the woman he loved - and still loves - are vanishing from his brain, he starts having second thoughts and wants the procedure stopped.  His challenge then becomes to figure out how to protect as much of his memory of her as he can, and to find a way stop the procedure despite the fact that he is in an unconscious state.\n\nThe manner in which he comes to realize and confront his dilemma is played out entirely within his interior landscape, a realm which (as anyone who remembers their dreams upon waking from sleep can attest) is a very surreal extension of our day-to-day experiences.  Michel Gondry's visual style and direction works exceptionally well here in conveying the slippery, chaotic unpredictability of the worlds we construct from our memories and experiences; the clever interplay between this interior world and the goings-on of the outside world helps keep the viewer off-balance just enough to illuminate the fuzzy line of demarcation separating the two worlds and the peculiar manner in which they play off one another.\n\nJim Carrey and Kate Winslett do an exceptional job of bringing this abstract story concept to life with characters that are endearing, poignant, believable and utterly human.  The supporting players are equally impressive: Tom Wilkinson as the mind-eraser doctor, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as the technicians, Kiersten Dunst as the receptionist all have relationships to the main protagonists and to one another that come to light as the story unfolds and help to propel the plot; as friends of Joel and Clementine, David Cross and Jane Adams are hilarious as a couple who seem to be stuck in the same rut that compelled the protagonists to break up and have each other erased from their respective minds.  Kaufman juggles all these relationships masterfully and in such a way as to ensure none of them are superfluous to the ideas he is trying to get across in this story.\n\nWhile there are elements of the plot that seem to place this movie in the realm of science fiction, the focus of the movie stays on the interior states, emotions and relationships between the characters.  As such, the film is more of a romantic comedy than anything - albeit unlike any other romantic comedy you're ever likely to see.  I saw a late showing of this movie with my girlfriend the day it was released at a local multiplex and there were only 20 or so people in the theater, yet at the film's conclusion everyone broke out in a spontaneous round of applause.

 --- Description: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: Directed by Michel Gondry. With Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Gerry Robert Byrne, Elijah Wood. When their relationship turns sour, a couple undergoes a medical procedure to have each other erased from their memories." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0338013/","name":"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NzcwODg3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEwOTMyMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When their relationship turns sour, a couple undergoes a medical procedure to have each other erased from their memories.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0338013/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"doctec","dateCreated":"2004-03-22","inLanguage":"English","name":"Interior Landscape","reviewBody":"Of all Kaufman's screenplays that delve into the interior landscapes of its characters, Eternal Sunshine is the most fully formed and moving story of the bunch, a rumination on the possibilities and consequences inherent in making the process of removing unwanted memories from your consciousness as easy as going for a checkup.  Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget the bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power to forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves.  At the very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again ("Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it"); at the worst, it eliminates the possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives and whose lives we shape through ours.\n\nThe film explores these ideas in a novel and engaging way: by taking the audience inside the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a man who, after breaking up with his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslett), discovers later that she has had her memory of him wiped clean from her mind.  He finds out how she had this procedure done and, despondent not only about the breakup but even more so about her having completely erased him from her mind, searches out the doctor who performed the procedure and signs up to have the same procedure done to him, so that he may also have no memory of her.  He is rendered unconscious for the procedure but his subconscious is still active.   Once the procedure is initiated and he becomes aware that his memories of the woman he loved - and still loves - are vanishing from his brain, he starts having second thoughts and wants the procedure stopped.  His challenge then becomes to figure out how to protect as much of his memory of her as he can, and to find a way stop the procedure despite the fact that he is in an unconscious state.\n\nThe manner in which he comes to realize and confront his dilemma is played out entirely within his interior landscape, a realm which (as anyone who remembers their dreams upon waking from sleep can attest) is a very surreal extension of our day-to-day experiences.  Michel Gondry's visual style and direction works exceptionally well here in conveying the slippery, chaotic unpredictability of the worlds we construct from our memories and experiences; the clever interplay between this interior world and the goings-on of the outside world helps keep the viewer off-balance just enough to illuminate the fuzzy line of demarcation separating the two worlds and the peculiar manner in which they play off one another.\n\nJim Carrey and Kate Winslett do an exceptional job of bringing this abstract story concept to life with characters that are endearing, poignant, believable and utterly human.  The supporting players are equally impressive: Tom Wilkinson as the mind-eraser doctor, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as the technicians, Kiersten Dunst as the receptionist all have relationships to the main protagonists and to one another that come to light as the story unfolds and help to propel the plot; as friends of Joel and Clementine, David Cross and Jane Adams are hilarious as a couple who seem to be stuck in the same rut that compelled the protagonists to break up and have each other erased from their respective minds.  Kaufman juggles all these relationships masterfully and in such a way as to ensure none of them are superfluous to the ideas he is trying to get across in this story.\n\nWhile there are elements of the plot that seem to place this movie in the realm of science fiction, the focus of the movie stays on the interior states, emotions and relationships between the characters.  As such, the film is more of a romantic comedy than anything - albeit unlike any other romantic comedy you're ever likely to see.  I saw a late showing of this movie with my girlfriend the day it was released at a local multiplex and there were only 20 or so people in the theater, yet at the film's conclusion everyone broke out in a spontaneous round of applause.  This gives an idea of how compelling this movie can be.  If you give this film a chance to creep under your skin, you will likely find yourself reflexively thinking about your feelings toward the important people in your life, as well how you relate to those feelings, as well as your memories and how you relate to them.  A thought provoking, moving and entertaining film - I can imagine that a working title of this film might have been "Warts And All."","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":959436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-03-19","keywords":"memory,loneliness,valentine's day,flashback,nonlinear timeline","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2292515097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA4YjQ5ZjEtMGQ4Mi00NWExLTkxMGQtNzAwYzVmNTU1ODJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA4YjQ5ZjEtMGQ4Mi00NWExLTkxMGQtNzAwYzVmNTU1ODJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000120/","name":"Jim Carrey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0929489/","name":"Tom Wilkinson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0327273/","name":"Michel Gondry"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017525/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017713/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0442109/","name":"Charlie Kaufman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0327273/","name":"Michel Gondry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1410028/","name":"Pierre Bismuth"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is a direct continuation of that story.\n\nThe good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.\n\nDirector/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) "in the role" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.\n\nAfter the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the "inside" was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.\n\nDuring the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.\n\nCoppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended "flashback" segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.\n\nBut let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.\n\nThere's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call "J.K. Rowling Syndrome". That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.\n\nThe film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.\n\nI've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.\n\nThe second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.\n\nAlthough the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1199431,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1974-12-18","keywords":"revenge,1950s,corrupt politician,cuban revolution,lake tahoe nevada","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Godfather: Part II","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi696162841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4YzY4OGMtZDM5YS00YWVkLTgwMDktNzVmOGU3NjEwMjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4YzY4OGMtZDM5YS00YWVkLTgwMDktNzVmOGU3NjEwMjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Godfather: Part II"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000380/","name":"Robert Duvall"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099634/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020958/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701374/","name":"Mario Puzo"}],"duration":"PT3H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is a direct continuation of that story.\n\nThe good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.\n\nDirector/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) "in the role" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.\n\nAfter the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the "inside" was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.\n\nDuring the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.\n\nCoppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended "flashback" segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.\n\nBut let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl.

The relationship formed between the two leads is unquestionably one of the best and is, so far, most endearing. It is impossible to not like them.\n\nI'll start with Nathan Fillion(of "Firefly" fame). Nathan plays Richard 'Rick' Castle. His charm and wit and spot-on comedic delivery make him alone the reason to tune in each week. Move over David Boreanaz 'cause Nathan has got you beat in the plucky-comedic-male-sidekick-to-tough-and-serious-female-cop role. Nathan comes off as the friend we all want and treasure. Having followed Nathan's career rather closely I am glad to see him in this role. It fits his nature and you can tell he knows it too just by watching him. It's in his postures and mannerisms and facial expressions. I believe he said in an interview that he is "72%" this character and that sounds about right. He is comfortable in this role. Similar to how he was comfortable when playing Malcom Reynolds in "Firefly"(which, by the way, is the greatest show of all time...period).\n\nThen there is Stana Katic, who plays Detective Kate Beckett, and God is she gorgeous and enticing. No wonder Nathan's character can't get enough of her. Stana manages to instill in the portrayal of her character enough grit and fortitude to be mysterious and alluring, while retaining a good amount of the audiences confidence in her ability to be a bad-ass. On the other side, though, she is beautiful and her lightly-flirtatious nature does not detract from the other part of her character but rather enriches it making her feel real rather than just a cliché tough female cop(because TV is full of them right now).\n\nWhat it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen, is chemistry and these two have it. They are a joy to watch even when they are not in scenes together and that is what will keep viewers tuning in each week. This show has great promise.\n\nBefore I go I will note that it was nice to see real authors on the show(I will not reveal who). It adds another layer to Castle's character and makes for an amusing poker scene. I hope the producers arrange for more cameos of this nature. \n\nDone.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153161,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-03-09","keywords":"female detective,new york city,homicide investigation,novelist,crime writer","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277213/","name":"Nathan Fillion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065664/","name":"Stana Katic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0838360/","name":"Susan Sullivan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097246/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0163896/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

So far he's proved me right.\n\nI have been anticipating Art School Confidential for a long time. I found out about it through the IMDb, and as a big fan of Zwigoff's previous work, I was really looking forward to seeing what he was going to do with the fabulous cast he had assembled (Malkovich, Huston, Buscemi, etc). The movie did not disappoint.\n\nThe beginning of the film is about what I expected- cute, off-beat story about a talented geek who goes to art school and pursues the girl of his dreams. And then it got dark. And then it got very dark. And then it got extremely dark. I soon realized I had no idea where it was going to take me next, and that excited me.

I disagree. It has misanthropic aspects, misanthropic characters, but overall I found that it ended on an expressly positive note. I absolutely loved the ending. Five minutes before it ended, I wasn't sure how it was going to end, and that, in my opinion, is the best way to do it. Zwigoff's direction is also very impressive. There's a distinct difference in the atmosphere throughout- it starts out looking and feeling sunnier and lighter, and as Minghella's character becomes darker, so does the look of the movie. Just one of those little things that adds to the overall experience.\n\nArt School Confidential thoroughly covers ground that Ghost World touched on briefly- namely, the line between art and BS. It is clearly a subject on which Terry Zwigoff has a lot to say, and he says it very eloquently. The cast is great, the music is great, the direction is great. Go see it. And let me say again...

The relationship formed between the two leads is unquestionably one of the best and is, so far, most endearing. It is impossible to not like them.\n\nI'll start with Nathan Fillion(of "Firefly" fame). Nathan plays Richard 'Rick' Castle. His charm and wit and spot-on comedic delivery make him alone the reason to tune in each week. Move over David Boreanaz 'cause Nathan has got you beat in the plucky-comedic-male-sidekick-to-tough-and-serious-female-cop role. Nathan comes off as the friend we all want and treasure. Having followed Nathan's career rather closely I am glad to see him in this role. It fits his nature and you can tell he knows it too just by watching him. It's in his postures and mannerisms and facial expressions. I believe he said in an interview that he is "72%" this character and that sounds about right. He is comfortable in this role. Similar to how he was comfortable when playing Malcom Reynolds in "Firefly"(which, by the way, is the greatest show of all time...period).\n\nThen there is Stana Katic, who plays Detective Kate Beckett, and God is she gorgeous and enticing. No wonder Nathan's character can't get enough of her. Stana manages to instill in the portrayal of her character enough grit and fortitude to be mysterious and alluring, while retaining a good amount of the audiences confidence in her ability to be a bad-ass. On the other side, though, she is beautiful and her lightly-flirtatious nature does not detract from the other part of her character but rather enriches it making her feel real rather than just a cliché tough female cop(because TV is full of them right now).\n\nWhat it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen, is chemistry and these two have it. They are a joy to watch even when they are not in scenes together and that is what will keep viewers tuning in each week. This show has great promise.\n\nBefore I go I will note that it was nice to see real authors on the show(I will not reveal who). It adds another layer to Castle's character and makes for an amusing poker scene. I hope the producers arrange for more cameos of this nature. \n\nDone.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153161,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-03-09","keywords":"female detective,new york city,homicide investigation,novelist,crime writer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277213/","name":"Nathan Fillion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065664/","name":"Stana Katic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0838360/","name":"Susan Sullivan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097246/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0163896/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

It adds another layer to Castle's character and makes for an amusing poker scene.

The relationship formed between the two leads is unquestionably one of the best and is, so far, most endearing. It is impossible to not like them.\n\nI'll start with Nathan Fillion(of "Firefly" fame). Nathan plays Richard 'Rick' Castle. His charm and wit and spot-on comedic delivery make him alone the reason to tune in each week. Move over David Boreanaz 'cause Nathan has got you beat in the plucky-comedic-male-sidekick-to-tough-and-serious-female-cop role. Nathan comes off as the friend we all want and treasure. Having followed Nathan's career rather closely I am glad to see him in this role. It fits his nature and you can tell he knows it too just by watching him. It's in his postures and mannerisms and facial expressions. I believe he said in an interview that he is "72%" this character and that sounds about right. He is comfortable in this role. Similar to how he was comfortable when playing Malcom Reynolds in "Firefly"(which, by the way, is the greatest show of all time...period).\n\nThen there is Stana Katic, who plays Detective Kate Beckett, and God is she gorgeous and enticing. No wonder Nathan's character can't get enough of her. Stana manages to instill in the portrayal of her character enough grit and fortitude to be mysterious and alluring, while retaining a good amount of the audiences confidence in her ability to be a bad-ass. On the other side, though, she is beautiful and her lightly-flirtatious nature does not detract from the other part of her character but rather enriches it making her feel real rather than just a cliché tough female cop(because TV is full of them right now).\n\nWhat it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen, is chemistry and these two have it. They are a joy to watch even when they are not in scenes together and that is what will keep viewers tuning in each week. This show has great promise.\n\nBefore I go I will note that it was nice to see real authors on the show(I will not reveal who). It adds another layer to Castle's character and makes for an amusing poker scene. I hope the producers arrange for more cameos of this nature. \n\nDone.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153161,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-03-09","keywords":"female detective,new york city,homicide investigation,novelist,crime writer","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277213/","name":"Nathan Fillion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065664/","name":"Stana Katic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0838360/","name":"Susan Sullivan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097246/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0163896/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

    <desc lang="hr">Deseta sezona staroj ekipi donosi u život nove ljude poput djeteta Howarda i Bernadette, ali ljubavni problemi svih genijalaca su i dalje prisutni. U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

I was upset with me for not watching Chicago Fire initially. Readers, to understand Chicago PD, you have to watch Chicago Fire. I love the intertwining of the shows. It is so damn interesting.\n\nChicago Fire is a potpourri of diversity, family, loyalty, emotions and laughter. A show that promotes life/death,the response and the danger firefighters face everyday, gives me a deeper respect for my local firefighter and EMT services.\n\nI commend Mr. Wolf for having such great writers and actors/actress, I am humbled.

I attended the premiere of CARS at LMS on Friday, May 26. True to Disney form, the premiere itself was spectacular. Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the "original", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep. As always, don't leave your seat until all of the credits roll. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie! You'll love them this time, as they tie back to prior Pixar movies, in a car sort of way. This is definitely a movie we'll add to the DVD collection. I really hope this movie does well since it's the first release since Disney bought Pixar. Don't go in looking for the action or adult humor of The Incredibles. If you do you'll be disappointed. Just go in looking for the "Disney always has a good moral behind its animated movies" type of movie and you will really enjoy it. Paul Newman and Larry the Cable Guy really have the best characters in the movie. And while John Ratzenberger's character doesn't have a lot of screen time, I really enjoyed him! I'll be going back to see it when it releases in theaters so I can get a better feel for the sound, as it wasn't the best in an outdoor setting.

Besides, I've been watching another Wolf Production since 1999 and that was good enough for me. However, when Chicago PD was introduced, I decided to watch it because it came on directly after my favorite show and I love TV drama series. I feel in love with Chicago PD because of the zest and criminal kick-ass and I was hooked.\n\nWhen Chicago Fire crossed over with Chicago PD recently, I was forced to watch Chicago Fire. Hummm, Chicago Fire very interesting and exciting I thought. I went to HBO On Demand and watched Season 2 of Chicago Fire. Let me tell you, I didn't cook, I didn't answer my phone, I ordered food delivery service and didn't move off of my sofa(only for bbreak) until I watched every episode. I then went to a local retail store and bought Season 1 and the disconnect from the world started all over again.

Besides, I've been watching another Wolf Production since 1999 and that was good enough for me. However, when Chicago PD was introduced, I decided to watch it because it came on directly after my favorite show and I love TV drama series. I feel in love with Chicago PD because of the zest and criminal kick-ass and I was hooked.\n\nWhen Chicago Fire crossed over with Chicago PD recently, I was forced to watch Chicago Fire. Hummm, Chicago Fire very interesting and exciting I thought. I went to HBO On Demand and watched Season 2 of Chicago Fire. Let me tell you, I didn't cook, I didn't answer my phone, I ordered food delivery service and didn't move off of my sofa(only for bbreak) until I watched every episode. I then went to a local retail store and bought Season 1 and the disconnect from the world started all over again. By now you know where my review is going.\n\nWatching Chicago Fire help me to understand Detective Voight, Dawson etc.. and how Chicago PD was piloted. I was upset with me for not watching Chicago Fire initially. Readers, to understand Chicago PD, you have to watch Chicago Fire. I love the intertwining of the shows. It is so damn interesting.\n\nChicago Fire is a potpourri of diversity, family, loyalty, emotions and laughter. A show that promotes life/death,the response and the danger firefighters face everyday, gives me a deeper respect for my local firefighter and EMT services.\n\nI commend Mr. Wolf for having such great writers and actors/actress, I am humbled. I am aware it's only entertainment. However it's entertainment in a true and realistic form.\n\nOne of the Best Shows on TV.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50700,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-10-10","keywords":"fire department,firefighter,rescue,rescue team,coworker relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1978325/","name":"Taylor Kinney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0831601/","name":"Christian Stolte","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0907708/","name":"Eamonn Walker"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104973/","name":"Michael Brandt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0351929/","name":"Derek Haas"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1918481177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NzAxNDQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwMzEwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NzAxNDQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwMzEwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Get a first look at Season 4 of "Chicago Fire.""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is so damn interesting.\n\nChicago Fire is a potpourri of diversity, family, loyalty, emotions and laughter. A show that promotes life/death,the response and the danger firefighters face everyday, gives me a deeper respect for my local firefighter and EMT services.\n\nI commend Mr. Wolf for having such great writers and actors/actress, I am humbled. I am aware it's only entertainment.

Sure, there were slapstick and broad humor sure to make little kiddos laugh. But I was surprised by the sophistication as well. The screwball comedy between the hero and heroine is very well done; adults can appreciate that. The sidekicks, in particular the Max and Pascal, are hilarious.

This is Pixar-worthy great. In fact, after a while I forgot it was CGI (which tends to be a bit stiff and crude when it comes to character animation). The human characters have that hand-drawn quality even though they're CG. In fact, they're more expressive than the hand-drawn characters in Princess and the Frog. The backgrounds are gorgeous (I can count every blade of grass). And there's an iconic scene where the kingdom rouses from darkness to light with thousands of floating lanterns -- it really is magical. It reminds me of classics such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty.\n\nBest of all, the movie is not just all laughs and slapstick. It has heart too. Even the minor characters such as the King and Queen -- you can feel the emotions. And the romance is believable and not cheesy.\n\nLike I said, I was very pleasantly surprised. It's something that is worthy of Pixar, and I'm glad to see Disney back on their game.

Even the minor characters such as the King and Queen -- you can feel the emotions. And the romance is believable and not cheesy.\n\nLike I said, I was very pleasantly surprised. It's something that is worthy of Pixar, and I'm glad to see Disney back on their game. While Princess and the Frog was a missed opportunity, Tangled is almost perfect.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":428452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-12-01","keywords":"rapunzel,based on fairy tale,disney,flower,female protagonist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tangled: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi385091865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzI2NDA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE1OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzI2NDA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE1OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The long-haired Princess Rapunzel has spent her entire life in a tower, but when she falls in love with a bandit who was passing by she must venture into the outside world for the first time to find him.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601553/","name":"Mandy Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1157048/","name":"Zachary Levi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0614220/","name":"Donna Murphy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1977355/","name":"Nathan Greno","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0397174/","name":"Byron Howard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074039/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1557594/","name":"Dan Fogelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342278/","name":"Jacob Grimm","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342303/","name":"Wilhelm Grimm"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He's rationalizing why the family will drive from Illinois, instead of fly, to Wally World, a moose-centered family amusement park in California. What makes this film enjoyable is that the Griswolds are so typical of banal American suburban family values.\n\nClark (Chevy Chase) is a good-natured sap, gullibly idealistic, and conforming. His meek wife (well played by Beverly D'Angelo) looks up to Clark. Their two teenage kids are dull blockheads, patterned after their dull parents. The boy wears ugly dental braces.\n\nTheir mode of travel is a prehistoric, humorously ugly, putrid green station wagon with cheesy brown panels. The Griswolds blast off with unlimited optimism and good-natured anticipation of the fun they will have at Wally World. But the optimism gradually fades and is replaced by grim determination after a series of on-the-road disasters that make a mockery of idealism.\n\nThe film's humor lies in its absurd plot situations, and in the dialogue. At a cookout, a down-on-his-luck Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) treats the Griswolds to backyard burgers, then remarks to Clark: "I don't know why they call this stuff hamburger helper. It does just fine by itself".\n\nCasting is appropriate. Overall acting trends humorously exaggerated, consistent with the satire. Performances by Imogene Coca and John Candy add to the comedy. The bouncy song "Holiday Road" opens the film with a series of vintage American postcards in tandem with the opening credits.\n\nMy only reservation is that some of the plot contrivances are a bit over-the-top. The writers seem to be trying a little too hard.\n\n"Vacation" is a satire on the banality of the traditional American summer ritual, and therefore thematically rich. Production values are fine. Though not perfect, this film is worth watching.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104510,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1983-07-29","keywords":"road movie,dysfunctional family,national lampoon series,blonde in ferrari,lust","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2924395289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmUxYTc1ZDMtZDM2Yi00YjdhLTg5YTctMDVlZmU2ZjRiM2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmUxYTc1ZDMtZDM2Yi00YjdhLTg5YTctMDVlZmU2ZjRiM2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000331/","name":"Chevy Chase"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000350/","name":"Beverly D'Angelo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168042/","name":"Imogene Coca"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102282/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000455/","name":"John Hughes"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He's rationalizing why the family will drive from Illinois, instead of fly, to Wally World, a moose-centered family amusement park in California. What makes this film enjoyable is that the Griswolds are so typical of banal American suburban family values.\n\nClark (Chevy Chase) is a good-natured sap, gullibly idealistic, and conforming. His meek wife (well played by Beverly D'Angelo) looks up to Clark. Their two teenage kids are dull blockheads, patterned after their dull parents. The boy wears ugly dental braces.\n\nTheir mode of travel is a prehistoric, humorously ugly, putrid green station wagon with cheesy brown panels. The Griswolds blast off with unlimited optimism and good-natured anticipation of the fun they will have at Wally World. But the optimism gradually fades and is replaced by grim determination after a series of on-the-road disasters that make a mockery of idealism.\n\nThe film's humor lies in its absurd plot situations, and in the dialogue. At a cookout, a down-on-his-luck Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) treats the Griswolds to backyard burgers, then remarks to Clark: "I don't know why they call this stuff hamburger helper. It does just fine by itself".\n\nCasting is appropriate. Overall acting trends humorously exaggerated, consistent with the satire. Performances by Imogene Coca and John Candy add to the comedy. The bouncy song "Holiday Road" opens the film with a series of vintage American postcards in tandem with the opening credits.\n\nMy only reservation is that some of the plot contrivances are a bit over-the-top. The writers seem to be trying a little too hard.\n\n"Vacation" is a satire on the banality of the traditional American summer ritual, and therefore thematically rich. Production values are fine. Though not perfect, this film is worth watching.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104510,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1983-07-29","keywords":"road movie,dysfunctional family,national lampoon series,blonde in ferrari,lust","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2924395289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmUxYTc1ZDMtZDM2Yi00YjdhLTg5YTctMDVlZmU2ZjRiM2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmUxYTc1ZDMtZDM2Yi00YjdhLTg5YTctMDVlZmU2ZjRiM2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000331/","name":"Chevy Chase","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000350/","name":"Beverly D'Angelo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168042/","name":"Imogene Coca"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102282/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000455/","name":"John Hughes"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That alone is an achievement in its own right.\n\nAfter some years living in peace in a new pack, our old friends Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano) and Diego the Sabertooth tiger (Dennis Leary) discover that the ice is melting and a flood will cover the valley they now call home.

Two new characters, the young possums Crash (Sean William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) are a welcomed addition to the family, as well as Ellie (Queen Latifah), the lost mammoth.\n\nEllie, Manny and their relationship is a very important subplot in the movie, and one that was perfectly handled by the director and his crew. While Diego's subplot was also interesting and served as basis for very good jokes, it didn't had enough screen-time; a shame in my opinion, but overall the movie was very good.\n\nTo summarize, fans of the first "Ice Age" won't be disappointed by "The Meltdown", and sure the movie will give laughs to both kids and their parents. While still not as good as the first one, this sequel breaks the "sequel's curse" and is an entertaining film on its own right. 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268052,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-04-05","keywords":"ice age,sid character,scrat character,manny character,diego character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ice Age 2: The Meltdown","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi110166297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUzZjIxZDItY2NkMS00OGU0LWJmNGUtZTlmY2M5ZjUzNjc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUzZjIxZDItY2NkMS00OGU0LWJmNGUtZTlmY2M5ZjUzNjc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005380/","name":"Ray Romano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000491/","name":"John Leguizamo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001459/","name":"Denis Leary"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757858/","name":"Carlos Saldanha"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179259/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047265/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0310087/","name":"Peter Gaulke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0841532/","name":"Gerry Swallow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2186362/","name":"Jim Hecht"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While still not as good as the first one, this sequel breaks the "sequel's curse" and is an entertaining film on its own right. 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268052,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-04-05","keywords":"ice age,sid character,scrat character,manny character,diego character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ice Age 2: The Meltdown","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi110166297","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUzZjIxZDItY2NkMS00OGU0LWJmNGUtZTlmY2M5ZjUzNjc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUzZjIxZDItY2NkMS00OGU0LWJmNGUtZTlmY2M5ZjUzNjc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005380/","name":"Ray Romano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000491/","name":"John Leguizamo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001459/","name":"Denis Leary"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757858/","name":"Carlos Saldanha"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179259/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047265/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0310087/","name":"Peter Gaulke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0841532/","name":"Gerry Swallow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2186362/","name":"Jim Hecht"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When a comically inept con man (Jon Polito) comes to town, wanting to find a partner in a new business called "dry cleaning," we can see the signs a block away: Blackmail, best-laid-plans, murder ahead. The emphasis in this extremely academic take--more academic even than the Ph.Dish MILLER'S CROSSING--is on the sociological and political roots of noir.

But then Noir Guy starts contemplating hair. He is the Sisyphus of Noirtown, performing a perfectly stupid task that never ceases to repeat itself, without gathering the slightest meaning. He even, in his blank way, waxes philosophical, like a Marine-town Woyzeck: "I want...I wanna put hair with...dirt, regular house dirt." "Ed, what the heck are ya talkin' about?" "I...Skip it."\n\n And soon the movie metamorphs into a fedoras-and-Pall-Malls riff on Camus' THE STRANGER. Why does the Man Who Wasn't There kick off the chain of events that brings down all manner of ruination? Jealousy? Boredom? No ordinary human motives will do. And the Coens slyly insert a shyster lawyer (Tony Shalhoub) who's full of dime-store variants on post-structuralist touchstones: he uses the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as a sort of Twinkie Defense, and claims that his client is "Modern Man himself!...Indict him, and you are indicting yourself!" All of which, the Coens make clear, is so much malarkey--a way of kidding oneself, substituting entropy for dogma, avoiding the scary unknowableness of being alive.\n\n Ethan Coen described THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE as "the movie Martin Heidegger would have made if he had come to Hollywood"--unusually forthright for two guys who are just, aw shucks, entertainers.

There was no time for character development or much story development.  In fact, the opening credit scene itself took four or five minutes.

I think it had the same screen time as Tommy Lee Jones.  It was funny in small doses, but its role was expanded way too much for the sequel. Johnny Knoxville's character was lame as was the main villain, which had looks but no funny dialogue at all.  Tony Shaloub is back, and once again his character's role is small and underused.

After Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, a lot has happened for these lovable characters. Now that Ellie and Manny are together, they are going to have a baby which leaves Manny wanting everything to be perfect for when the addition arrives. Diego is bored and takes a look at his attitude and wonders if he's too laid-back about everything. Ice Age wouldn't be Ice Age without Scrat who is still trying to catch that acorn but has met his match when female sabre-tooth squirrel, Scratte, wants the acorn too. After Sid sees how happy Manny and Ellie are, he wants a family of his own so he steals three dinosaur eggs which leads to Sid being kidnapped to a weird underground world where his friends have to save him.\n\nThe animation is simply brilliant and very well done and the characters are funnier too, especially the little clips of Scrat and Scratte fighting over the acorn. The story in the movie was very good for a kids' movie and adults can be assured that they will like it too. The jokes were quite funny and there were some sneaky jokes in there for adults but children wouldn't probably see it. Also the one-liners in the movie are pretty funny too, such as when Manny says to Sid, "Don't worry, you'll meet a nice girl with low standards". The cast who lend their voices for our heroes were great too, especially Simon Pegg as Buck who added a bit more of comedy to the movie.\n\nOverall, I would say that this is better than the second movie but not the first. It's a great watch for kids and adults alike and is sure not to disappoint.\n\nRead more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":235418,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2009-07-01","keywords":"dinosaur,ice age,sid character,scrat character,manny character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3380019993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyODMyMDY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg2MTM0Mg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyODMyMDY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg2MTM0Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Manny, Sid, Diego, et al. encounter the dinosaur population who survived extinction in their tropical paradise, which existed below the thick layers of ice ... until now."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005380/","name":"Ray Romano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000491/","name":"John Leguizamo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001459/","name":"Denis Leary"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757858/","name":"Carlos Saldanha"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0862211/","name":"Michael Thurmeier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179259/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047265/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0073850/","name":"Michael Berg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0010004/","name":"Peter Ackerman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718514/","name":"Mike Reiss"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, a lot has happened for these lovable characters. Now that Ellie and Manny are together, they are going to have a baby which leaves Manny wanting everything to be perfect for when the addition arrives. Diego is bored and takes a look at his attitude and wonders if he's too laid-back about everything. Ice Age wouldn't be Ice Age without Scrat who is still trying to catch that acorn but has met his match when female sabre-tooth squirrel, Scratte, wants the acorn too. After Sid sees how happy Manny and Ellie are, he wants a family of his own so he steals three dinosaur eggs which leads to Sid being kidnapped to a weird underground world where his friends have to save him.\n\nThe animation is simply brilliant and very well done and the characters are funnier too, especially the little clips of Scrat and Scratte fighting over the acorn. The story in the movie was very good for a kids' movie and adults can be assured that they will like it too. The jokes were quite funny and there were some sneaky jokes in there for adults but children wouldn't probably see it. Also the one-liners in the movie are pretty funny too, such as when Manny says to Sid, "Don't worry, you'll meet a nice girl with low standards". The cast who lend their voices for our heroes were great too, especially Simon Pegg as Buck who added a bit more of comedy to the movie.\n\nOverall, I would say that this is better than the second movie but not the first. It's a great watch for kids and adults alike and is sure not to disappoint.\n\nRead more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":235418,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2009-07-01","keywords":"dinosaur,ice age,sid character,scrat character,manny character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3380019993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyODMyMDY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg2MTM0Mg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyODMyMDY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg2MTM0Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Manny, Sid, Diego, et al. encounter the dinosaur population who survived extinction in their tropical paradise, which existed below the thick layers of ice ... until now.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005380/","name":"Ray Romano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000491/","name":"John Leguizamo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001459/","name":"Denis Leary"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757858/","name":"Carlos Saldanha","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0862211/","name":"Michael Thurmeier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179259/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047265/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0073850/","name":"Michael Berg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0010004/","name":"Peter Ackerman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718514/","name":"Mike Reiss"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Lets face it, if they had all just been sitting there doing nothing it would still have been a highly successful film. People would have paid to see them organise their sock draws. However, this time around with a brand new script and an immensely prosperous cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original.\n\nIn the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it. Firstly because of the fact that they all took pay cuts so that it could happen and secondly because it comes across on screen. The easy friendship between Clooney, Pitt, Roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle. We know they had a good time filming it just as we are having a good time watching it.\n\nIt is easy to say that this is THE coolest film of the year. From the phenomenal script and direction from Steven Soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the 'stars' - yes every single one of them! With so many big names you would expect some rivalry yet there is no scene hogging in sight. It is clear to see that they are all willing to share the limelight. The fact is that there is no main character or personality. They are all in it together - reflecting the sense of the film in real life. This is the first concept the audience sees from the poster. The names are printed in alphabetical order. Nobody is given priority. Clooney plays Danny Ocean with the same self - confidence, composure and unmistakable coll that hasn't been seen since Sinatra himself. All the other characters are brand new, that is except for the character of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). In the 60s original Tess, played by Angie Dickinson, is Ocean's defender (to some extent). However, Roberts' re-vamped character is more self assured and unmoved by Ocean's charm. Rusty (Pitt) is rarely seen without snack in hand and the suit are certainly something to look at. He may be a new character but he is still played in the carefree manner typical of the Rat Pack.\n\nIt is refreshing to sit and watch a film such as this and not have to suffer the usual barrage of swearing and violence. The lack of such profanities only increases its wide appeal. It just goes to show that it can be done and that films do not neccessarily need it.\n\nOcean's Eleven is not your typical heist movie. To start with there are eleven people working together all with specific, indispensable jobs to do. Yet the mood is still light hearted which makes it even more compelling to watch. The inspired direction and flowing script assure that there is never a dull moment and that every scene is important, as is every character. There are also a couple of cameo appearances from some other big names to look out for.\n\nAdmittedly there is a bad side as there is in every film. In this instance it is Don Cheadles's cockney accent. Nice try but not quite right!\n\nThis is a film that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking 'that was really clever'. Perhaps it isn't quite what you would expect from such a star studded cast and an Oscar winning director. But that is why it is so much better than the archetypal Hollywood blockbusters that we have come to expect.\n\nThis is no run of the mill film. It was not about money or self promotion.

And of course, one of them is missing. And of course, they don't remember anything. And of course, they are mixed up in multiple situations occurring within the city.

They cranked the ante in conflict, but failed to improve anything or change anything from the 2009 comedy smash hit.

Not only externally, that though it depicts the end purity of nature when fox's being sued for environmental damage, but also that any man-found paradise is not free, but with a price and in this case, could be the ultimate price.\n\nI truly enjoyed the movie especially at times the sparks of life's insight and moments of traveller's consciousness that when you are there, in that destination, IT becomes reality and no longer are you foreign and problems arise regardless.\n\nThough the romance is distracting, Etienne, Canet's portrayal is quite the eye candy.\n\nDefinitely a watch, but may not appeal to all tastes.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":232137,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2000-02-11","keywords":"thailand,paradise,travel,beach,island","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Beach","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3699966233","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ0NmY3NjYtZmY0OC00OWI2LThhMDktMjlmZGE4OWZjNjMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ0NmY3NjYtZmY0OC00OWI2LThhMDktMjlmZGE4OWZjNjMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0842770/","name":"Tilda Swinton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0948679/","name":"Daniel York"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103732/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0388076/","name":"John Hodge"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Amidst all that foreign intrigue, you are truly alone - an opportunity to be truthful to your instincts.\n\nWhen you are young and you travel, recklessness and the need to experience drive almost all your decision, well other than budgetary constraints.\n\nIt is therefore quite truthful at times to relate to the character who is in search of this ultimate freedom, a place where all your worldly obligations are suspended and irrelevant.\n\nThe movie is an irony. Not only externally, that though it depicts the end purity of nature when fox's being sued for environmental damage, but also that any man-found paradise is not free, but with a price and in this case, could be the ultimate price.\n\nI truly enjoyed the movie especially at times the sparks of life's insight and moments of traveller's consciousness that when you are there, in that destination, IT becomes reality and no longer are you foreign and problems arise regardless.\n\nThough the romance is distracting, Etienne, Canet's portrayal is quite the eye candy.\n\nDefinitely a watch, but may not appeal to all tastes.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":232137,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2000-02-11","keywords":"thailand,paradise,travel,beach,island","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Beach","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3699966233","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ0NmY3NjYtZmY0OC00OWI2LThhMDktMjlmZGE4OWZjNjMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ0NmY3NjYtZmY0OC00OWI2LThhMDktMjlmZGE4OWZjNjMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0842770/","name":"Tilda Swinton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0948679/","name":"Daniel York"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103732/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0388076/","name":"John Hodge","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Lets face it, if they had all just been sitting there doing nothing it would still have been a highly successful film. People would have paid to see them organise their sock draws. However, this time around with a brand new script and an immensely prosperous cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original.\n\nIn the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it. Firstly because of the fact that they all took pay cuts so that it could happen and secondly because it comes across on screen. The easy friendship between Clooney, Pitt, Roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle. We know they had a good time filming it just as we are having a good time watching it.\n\nIt is easy to say that this is THE coolest film of the year. From the phenomenal script and direction from Steven Soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the 'stars' - yes every single one of them! With so many big names you would expect some rivalry yet there is no scene hogging in sight. It is clear to see that they are all willing to share the limelight. The fact is that there is no main character or personality. They are all in it together - reflecting the sense of the film in real life. This is the first concept the audience sees from the poster. The names are printed in alphabetical order. Nobody is given priority. Clooney plays Danny Ocean with the same self - confidence, composure and unmistakable coll that hasn't been seen since Sinatra himself. All the other characters are brand new, that is except for the character of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). In the 60s original Tess, played by Angie Dickinson, is Ocean's defender (to some extent). However, Roberts' re-vamped character is more self assured and unmoved by Ocean's charm. Rusty (Pitt) is rarely seen without snack in hand and the suit are certainly something to look at. He may be a new character but he is still played in the carefree manner typical of the Rat Pack.\n\nIt is refreshing to sit and watch a film such as this and not have to suffer the usual barrage of swearing and violence. The lack of such profanities only increases its wide appeal. It just goes to show that it can be done and that films do not neccessarily need it.\n\nOcean's Eleven is not your typical heist movie. To start with there are eleven people working together all with specific, indispensable jobs to do. Yet the mood is still light hearted which makes it even more compelling to watch. The inspired direction and flowing script assure that there is never a dull moment and that every scene is important, as is every character. There are also a couple of cameo appearances from some other big names to look out for.\n\nAdmittedly there is a bad side as there is in every film. In this instance it is Don Cheadles's cockney accent. Nice try but not quite right!\n\nThis is a film that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking 'that was really clever'. Perhaps it isn't quite what you would expect from such a star studded cast and an Oscar winning director. But that is why it is so much better than the archetypal Hollywood blockbusters that we have come to expect.\n\nThis is no run of the mill film. It was not about money or self promotion. It was about having fun and enjoying the job. Ocean's Eleven is not a film that will be forgotten seconds after you have seen it. It will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545847,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-20","keywords":"casino,heist,criminal mastermind,card dealer,ulcer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Eleven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1822294297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

The easy friendship between Clooney, Pitt, Roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle. We know they had a good time filming it just as we are having a good time watching it.\n\nIt is easy to say that this is THE coolest film of the year. From the phenomenal script and direction from Steven Soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the 'stars' - yes every single one of them! With so many big names you would expect some rivalry yet there is no scene hogging in sight. It is clear to see that they are all willing to share the limelight. The fact is that there is no main character or personality. They are all in it together - reflecting the sense of the film in real life. This is the first concept the audience sees from the poster. The names are printed in alphabetical order. Nobody is given priority. Clooney plays Danny Ocean with the same self - confidence, composure and unmistakable coll that hasn't been seen since Sinatra himself. All the other characters are brand new, that is except for the character of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). In the 60s original Tess, played by Angie Dickinson, is Ocean's defender (to some extent). However, Roberts' re-vamped character is more self assured and unmoved by Ocean's charm. Rusty (Pitt) is rarely seen without snack in hand and the suit are certainly something to look at. He may be a new character but he is still played in the carefree manner typical of the Rat Pack.\n\nIt is refreshing to sit and watch a film such as this and not have to suffer the usual barrage of swearing and violence. The lack of such profanities only increases its wide appeal. It just goes to show that it can be done and that films do not neccessarily need it.\n\nOcean's Eleven is not your typical heist movie. To start with there are eleven people working together all with specific, indispensable jobs to do. Yet the mood is still light hearted which makes it even more compelling to watch. The inspired direction and flowing script assure that there is never a dull moment and that every scene is important, as is every character. There are also a couple of cameo appearances from some other big names to look out for.\n\nAdmittedly there is a bad side as there is in every film. In this instance it is Don Cheadles's cockney accent. Nice try but not quite right!\n\nThis is a film that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking 'that was really clever'. Perhaps it isn't quite what you would expect from such a star studded cast and an Oscar winning director. But that is why it is so much better than the archetypal Hollywood blockbusters that we have come to expect.\n\nThis is no run of the mill film. It was not about money or self promotion. It was about having fun and enjoying the job. Ocean's Eleven is not a film that will be forgotten seconds after you have seen it. It will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545847,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-20","keywords":"casino,heist,criminal mastermind,card dealer,ulcer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Eleven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1822294297","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

What if I told you that this film had a setting of only one main location, two main actors and three supporting cast members?  While these elements don't make up what a classic movie sounds like on paper, add director Joel Schumacher (Bad Company, 8mm) into the mix, along with screenwriter Larry Cohen, who had this story handed down to him by Alfred Hitchcock himself about 30 years ago, and you have the perfect blend of blackmail, violence and extortion:  Phone Booth. The story begins by showing a glimpse into the life of Stu Shepard (Daredevil's Colin Farrell).  Stu is a New York hustler that people love to hate.  He is egotistical, two-faced to everyone he knows and does what he can for personal gratification.  He even fantasizes about cheating on his wife Kelly (Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell) and the object of that desire is Pamela McFadden (Dawson Creek's Katie Holmes).  Pam is a young actress trying to get her first break, while Stu has been grooming her for the big time.  To avoid having his calls to Pam appear on his cellular phone bill, Stu calls her from the lone phone booth left in the heart of NYC. However, things would be different on this day.  Upon hanging up, he receives a call that would turn his whole world upside down. The caller (24's Kiefer Sutherland) is a sniper, who has been targeting high-profile underhanded suits, just like Stu.  He has a few simple rules so that Stu does not meet the same fate that two others had before him: don't leave the booth, don't tell anyone who he's talking to, and most importantly, don't hang up.  To prove his seriousness, the caller shoots and kills a pimp who tries to physically remove Stu from the booth for taking too much time with his call.  This, as expected, does not help matters, and the fallen pimp's hookers now believe it was indeed Stu who committed the murder.  Soon, the NYPD and numerous media outlets are covering this serious situation. Things become increasingly difficult for Stu Shepard as Kelly and Pam both show up.  In the meantime, the caller continues to play various mind games, while the sympathetic NYPD Captain Ramey (Twilight Zone's Forest Whitaker) tries to solve the issue.  During all of this, Stu tries to maintain his sanity and not risk any more lives.  His lies no longer matter.  As a result, he must now search his soul, discover himself and attempt to outsmart the caller, taking the game to a whole new level. The cinematography is outstanding. Schumacher uses the right angle for every shot, and manages to keep everyone's attention with quick pans and abrupt cuts.  In the end, the 80-minute movie seems longer but not because it is boring.  The biggest payoff comes with the twist ending that changes the film's outcome within sixty seconds. There was not one bad performance in Phone Booth.  Farrell's ability to convert his Irish brogue to a Brooklyn drawl makes his performance as Bullseye in Daredevil look like a child's school play when compared to the Broadway-level of acting he manages here.  While Mitchell and Holmes did not have lengthy parts, their roles added just enough to the story and they managed to perform up to the standards of their characters.  Forest Whitaker was a surprisingly great addition to the cast and his role as a sympathetic cop is one that's not often seen, and should thus be welcomed.  However, all of these actors are outshined by Kiefer Sutherland, who ends up being extremely creepy and one of the best antagonists in recent movie history by just using his voice. Will this win Best Picture at next year's Academy Awards? It probably won't.  However, with a great story, top-notch directing and a cast with great chemistry, what more could you ask for?  Out of a possible five stars, I give this the limit of five with desires to go even higher.  While I would go see it again and again, not everyone has the same tastes.  However, I would put down the $8 for a ticket to see the flick at least once.  If nothing else, it will make you stop and think:  the next time you enter a phone booth, just who will be watching?"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":260971,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2003-06-11","keywords":"single set production,psychopath,phone booth,sniper,hostage","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Phone Booth","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi932970777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJkN2QxODUtN2Q2OS00OGE1LTk2ZjgtM2ExYjcyMTJlMDg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJkN2QxODUtN2Q2OS00OGE1LTk2ZjgtM2ExYjcyMTJlMDg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000662/","name":"Kiefer Sutherland"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001845/","name":"Forest Whitaker"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001708/","name":"Joel Schumacher"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150494/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0169540/","name":"Larry Cohen"}],"duration":"PT1H21M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

What if I told you that this film had a setting of only one main location, two main actors and three supporting cast members?  While these elements don't make up what a classic movie sounds like on paper, add director Joel Schumacher (Bad Company, 8mm) into the mix, along with screenwriter Larry Cohen, who had this story handed down to him by Alfred Hitchcock himself about 30 years ago, and you have the perfect blend of blackmail, violence and extortion:  Phone Booth. The story begins by showing a glimpse into the life of Stu Shepard (Daredevil's Colin Farrell).  Stu is a New York hustler that people love to hate.  He is egotistical, two-faced to everyone he knows and does what he can for personal gratification.  He even fantasizes about cheating on his wife Kelly (Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell) and the object of that desire is Pamela McFadden (Dawson Creek's Katie Holmes).  Pam is a young actress trying to get her first break, while Stu has been grooming her for the big time.  To avoid having his calls to Pam appear on his cellular phone bill, Stu calls her from the lone phone booth left in the heart of NYC. However, things would be different on this day.  Upon hanging up, he receives a call that would turn his whole world upside down. The caller (24's Kiefer Sutherland) is a sniper, who has been targeting high-profile underhanded suits, just like Stu.  He has a few simple rules so that Stu does not meet the same fate that two others had before him: don't leave the booth, don't tell anyone who he's talking to, and most importantly, don't hang up.  To prove his seriousness, the caller shoots and kills a pimp who tries to physically remove Stu from the booth for taking too much time with his call.  This, as expected, does not help matters, and the fallen pimp's hookers now believe it was indeed Stu who committed the murder.  Soon, the NYPD and numerous media outlets are covering this serious situation. Things become increasingly difficult for Stu Shepard as Kelly and Pam both show up.  In the meantime, the caller continues to play various mind games, while the sympathetic NYPD Captain Ramey (Twilight Zone's Forest Whitaker) tries to solve the issue.  During all of this, Stu tries to maintain his sanity and not risk any more lives.  His lies no longer matter.  As a result, he must now search his soul, discover himself and attempt to outsmart the caller, taking the game to a whole new level. The cinematography is outstanding. Schumacher uses the right angle for every shot, and manages to keep everyone's attention with quick pans and abrupt cuts.  In the end, the 80-minute movie seems longer but not because it is boring.  The biggest payoff comes with the twist ending that changes the film's outcome within sixty seconds. There was not one bad performance in Phone Booth.  Farrell's ability to convert his Irish brogue to a Brooklyn drawl makes his performance as Bullseye in Daredevil look like a child's school play when compared to the Broadway-level of acting he manages here.  While Mitchell and Holmes did not have lengthy parts, their roles added just enough to the story and they managed to perform up to the standards of their characters.  Forest Whitaker was a surprisingly great addition to the cast and his role as a sympathetic cop is one that's not often seen, and should thus be welcomed.  However, all of these actors are outshined by Kiefer Sutherland, who ends up being extremely creepy and one of the best antagonists in recent movie history by just using his voice. Will this win Best Picture at next year's Academy Awards? It probably won't.  However, with a great story, top-notch directing and a cast with great chemistry, what more could you ask for?  Out of a possible five stars, I give this the limit of five with desires to go even higher.  While I would go see it again and again, not everyone has the same tastes.  However, I would put down the $8 for a ticket to see the flick at least once.  If nothing else, it will make you stop and think:  the next time you enter a phone booth, just who will be watching?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":260971,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2003-06-11","keywords":"single set production,psychopath,phone booth,sniper,hostage","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Phone Booth","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi932970777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJkN2QxODUtN2Q2OS00OGE1LTk2ZjgtM2ExYjcyMTJlMDg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJkN2QxODUtN2Q2OS00OGE1LTk2ZjgtM2ExYjcyMTJlMDg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000662/","name":"Kiefer Sutherland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001845/","name":"Forest Whitaker"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001708/","name":"Joel Schumacher"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150494/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0169540/","name":"Larry Cohen"],"duration":"PT1H21M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The Hangover Part II simply changed nothing at all, and offered nothing new with the attitude of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." What will please fan's the most with The Hangover Part III, is that is does not follow the same formula that the first two did. However, a lot of fan's will be headed into disappointment when they realize that this third instalment decides to take a completely different change in direction than that of its predecessors. And by completely, I mean very much drastically.\n\nThe story follows the Wolf Pack yet again as they try to help Alan (Zach Galifianakis) get back on track due to him being off his meds, and soon enough they get thrown into a Mission Impossible-esque mission to save their friend Doug (Justin Bartha, who yet again takes a miss on all the excitement) from Marshall (John Goodman), an angry gangster who wants' the Wolf Pack to find Chow (Ken Jeong, who has a much larger screen time in this instalment) and return to him to them with 21 million dollars in gold bricks that he stole. If not, Doug gets the offing. \n\nA major plot point is the development of Alan. His friends Phil and Stu (Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms) are mature and grown men who have happily settled down, but he is still very much stuck as a spoilt rotten teenager within a man's body, and his life is going nowhere. Throughout the adventure, it really is a tale about Alan and watching him grow into the man he should have become years ago. Fans of The Hangover owe it to themselves to watch it, whatever their final opinion of it may be.\n\nWhereas The Hangover Part III doesn't match the quality of its first part, it definitely doesn't deserve all the negativity it has been getting. The film does a good job of balancing the well known Hangover humour with the Mission Impossible-esque set pieces, and all the recurring stars do well reprising their roles. One of the biggest changes that The Hangover Part III entails is that there is no actual drinking/hangover sequence. There's also no wedding or no missing person (or a pot smoking monkey). Instead, it plays it much straighter and it knows what it wants to set out to do, which is to stray far away from the formula of the first two chapters. And by doing so, it makes the finale to The Hangover Trilogy one to remember.\n\nMy Verdict: The Hangover Part III is a fitting end to the trilogy, but despite its changes in directions fans will be divided, resulting in a love or hate for this final chapter.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":305151,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2013-05-29","keywords":"heart attack,giraffe,breast implant,prostitute,karaoke bar","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2312742425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This time, there's no wedding.

This is my third movie I've seen by him and he still has not disappointed me. I remember when I first saw Kick Ass and was blown away with how great it is (probably in my top 25). \n\nThis film is a big shout out (basically) to old spy films. It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.\n\nThe action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.\n\nThere really aren't any huge gripes for this movie. The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act. \n\nKingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments. However it all worked because of the smooth editing and well-choreographed scenes along with great acting from the entire cast. If you are looking for a good popcorn movie to see, this is a movie you should see with your pals.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":625090,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-29","keywords":"spy,female rear nudity,training,class differences,secret organization","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1901244185","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A super-secret spy organization recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5473782/","name":"Taron Egerton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

I remember when I first saw Kick Ass and was blown away with how great it is (probably in my top 25). \n\nThis film is a big shout out (basically) to old spy films. It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.\n\nThe action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.\n\nThere really aren't any huge gripes for this movie. The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act. \n\nKingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments. However it all worked because of the smooth editing and well-choreographed scenes along with great acting from the entire cast. If you are looking for a good popcorn movie to see, this is a movie you should see with your pals.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":625090,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-29","keywords":"spy,female rear nudity,training,class differences,secret organization","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1901244185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A super-secret spy organization recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5473782/","name":"Taron Egerton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

A little known independent film called The Nest proves that point rather well. Director / writer Sean Durkin sets an ominous tone from the onset in this psychological study about a family coming undone with their abrupt relocation from America to the UK. To say that the move does not go well is an understatement.\n\nRory O'Hara and his lovely wife, Allison, live the perfect storybook life. He is a rich trader and she is his pampered trophy wife caught in 80's opulence and living the good life. All seems well enough on the surface with the O'Hara's until Rory decides to head back to his hometown of London and uproot his family. One small problem: Rory is a grifter and liar and he and his family will be forced to make the ultimate sacrifices due to his overt actions.\n\nThe family dynamic is odd from the start. Unexplained circumstances occur with some subtle but mostly heavy-handed symbolism (a dark horse buried and suddenly exhumed, an expensive fur coat showing personal greed and wealth, doors unable to lock, hidden cigarette butts indicating rebellion, a wool sweater showing character enabling, etc.). The on-going tension slowly builds and personality traits morph these characters into totally different individuals,: Samantha (Oona Roche) becomes the defiant teenage daughter, Ben (Charlie Shotwell) morphs into a introverted young boy and the husband/wife tag team, expertly played by Jude Law and Carrie Coons, become a warring tribe sorting through all of their self-centered behaviors. Mr. Durkin's screenplay establishes its tone most effectively, but only hints at the betrayals and destructive behaviors of this family. Scenes of more direct conflict could have created to produce a more concise family portrait.\n\nStill most of the film is atmospheric and engaging due to Sean Durkin's fine direction and the acting of Mr. Law and Ms. Coons as the battling spouses. They are very good in their roles and bring their characters' self-indulgences and bitternesses centerstage. Their explosive scenes are terrific when they finally arrive as they snipe and rage at each other, but they are rarely viewed. Most of their inner anger stays within, always simmering to the top, yet rarely brims over. As their children, both Ms. Roche and Mr. Shotwell are totally convincing as pawns in their parent's gamesmanship.\n\nThe Nest is a special type of film, more for those moviegoers interested in psychological tension, creepy atmosphere, and well-define characters than a plot-driven story with definite results. Despite much to admire, this nest is a tad empty.

In my opinion, it easily beats the other animated movies released over the past year or so.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":393517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-09-06","keywords":"car,car movie,route 66,truck,tow truck","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"How the Best Racing Films Raise the Stakes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi365149977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief, sponsored by Coca-Cola, we're putting the pedal to the metal on the best racing films of all time.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001372/","name":"Bonnie Hunt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460146/","name":"Jorgen Klubien"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In truth, the Spartans were backed by a mixed force of almost 7,000, while there are enormous variations in modern estimates of the multi-ethnic Persian army, but somewhere between 100,000-200,000 seems realistic. Whatever the actual figures, the odds against the Spartans were terrible, death was inevitable, and their honour secure.\n\nThe story was first told on film in 1962 when director Rudolph Maté went to Greece and shot a worthy, but conventional and surprisingly leaden, version entitled "The 300 Spartans", starring American Richard Egan as King Leonidas and the British David Farrar as Xerxes. "300" takes the same basic narrative and presents it in an utterly different style in a blood-fest when "The Wild Bunch" meets "Kill Bill" and the visuals are like nothing except "Sin City". This time the director is Zack Snyder, known for his music videos, and the location is a studio set in Montreal with green backgrounds later filled by superb computer-generated graphics and the whole storybook style is based on the graphic novel by co-producer Frank Miller. Both versions use the legendary exchange: "When we attack today, our arrows will blot out the sun!" "Good; then we will fight in the shade." But only "300" has such fun lines as: "Spartans! Enjoy your breakfast, for tonight we dine in Hell!" \n\nEver since its first public showing at the Berlin Film Festival, most critics have mauled "300" and it presents an easy target for those wanting something more cerebral: there is virtually no plot or characterisation, the script is sparse and bland, much of the acting is exaggerated and over-loud, when it is not homo-erotic it is oddly camp, and the whole thing is stereotypical when it is not outright xenophobic and politically incorrect. And yet, as entertainment, it has much to offer: the sepia-tinged visuals are absolutely stunning and the fight sequences viscerally exciting. I was fortunate enough to see it in IMAX and I regularly felt blood-splattered and exhausted and quite ready to leap into the action.\n\nThere are no big names in the cast list which helps the sense of history but does not raise the thespian talent quotient. Gerard Butler plays King Leonidas with a Scottish accent, while the Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro is a version of Xerxes bejewelled with ethnic metalwork.

In truth, the Spartans were backed by a mixed force of almost 7,000, while there are enormous variations in modern estimates of the multi-ethnic Persian army, but somewhere between 100,000-200,000 seems realistic. Whatever the actual figures, the odds against the Spartans were terrible, death was inevitable, and their honour secure.\n\nThe story was first told on film in 1962 when director Rudolph Maté went to Greece and shot a worthy, but conventional and surprisingly leaden, version entitled "The 300 Spartans", starring American Richard Egan as King Leonidas and the British David Farrar as Xerxes. "300" takes the same basic narrative and presents it in an utterly different style in a blood-fest when "The Wild Bunch" meets "Kill Bill" and the visuals are like nothing except "Sin City". This time the director is Zack Snyder, known for his music videos, and the location is a studio set in Montreal with green backgrounds later filled by superb computer-generated graphics and the whole storybook style is based on the graphic novel by co-producer Frank Miller. Both versions use the legendary exchange: "When we attack today, our arrows will blot out the sun!" "Good; then we will fight in the shade." But only "300" has such fun lines as: "Spartans! Enjoy your breakfast, for tonight we dine in Hell!" \n\nEver since its first public showing at the Berlin Film Festival, most critics have mauled "300" and it presents an easy target for those wanting something more cerebral: there is virtually no plot or characterisation, the script is sparse and bland, much of the acting is exaggerated and over-loud, when it is not homo-erotic it is oddly camp, and the whole thing is stereotypical when it is not outright xenophobic and politically incorrect. And yet, as entertainment, it has much to offer: the sepia-tinged visuals are absolutely stunning and the fight sequences viscerally exciting. I was fortunate enough to see it in IMAX and I regularly felt blood-splattered and exhausted and quite ready to leap into the action.\n\nThere are no big names in the cast list which helps the sense of history but does not raise the thespian talent quotient. Gerard Butler plays King Leonidas with a Scottish accent, while the Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro is a version of Xerxes bejewelled with ethnic metalwork. Most of the warriors are literally larger than life: the actors playing the Spartans reveal most of their bodies with digitally-enhanced muscles, while on Xerxes' side characters include a huge hunchback, a giant emissary and a claw-armed executioner as well the metal-masked Immortals. This is before we get on to an enormous raging rhino and bedecked elephants. Truly this is a battle with a circus-like cast. The love interest comes from the feisty wife of Leonidas, Queen Gorgo, portrayed by the alluring British actress Lena Headey. There is even a scene in a rippling corn field borrowed from "Gladiator".\n\nAt the end of the day, what makes the movie are the thrilling fight sequences with encounters in which the film is slowed down and then speeded up to give a video-game quality that is unlike anything you have previously seen on the big screen. Whem a sword slashes or a spear lungs or an arrow whistles, you really feel and hear it.

CIA Operative Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) is sent into Iran to evacuate the Americans out safely under the cover of being a film production crew working on a picture called 'Argo'.\n\nThe film is absolutely amazing and definitely one of the best films I've seen in a long time, throughout 2012 and 2013 so far we have been treated with some great films such as Skyfall, Django Unchained, Life of Pi, Les Miserables, Zero Dark Thirty and more, but in my own personal opinion Argo takes the bait as the best of them all. Proof is present as it won 3 BAFTA's for best picture, best director and best editing, also nominated for a further 8 Oscars in 85th Academy Awards.\n\nThe film is packed with a sense of threat, peril and intensity all portrayed exceptionally well through the ensemble cast including Ben Affleck (The Town), John Goodman (Big Lebowski), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Alan Arkin (Edward Scissorhands) and Victor Garber (Titanic).

 --- Description: Argo: Directed by Ben Affleck. With Ben Affleck, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, John Goodman.

CIA Operative Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) is sent into Iran to evacuate the Americans out safely under the cover of being a film production crew working on a picture called 'Argo'.\n\nThe film is absolutely amazing and definitely one of the best films I've seen in a long time, throughout 2012 and 2013 so far we have been treated with some great films such as Skyfall, Django Unchained, Life of Pi, Les Miserables, Zero Dark Thirty and more, but in my own personal opinion Argo takes the bait as the best of them all. Proof is present as it won 3 BAFTA's for best picture, best director and best editing, also nominated for a further 8 Oscars in 85th Academy Awards.\n\nThe film is packed with a sense of threat, peril and intensity all portrayed exceptionally well through the ensemble cast including Ben Affleck (The Town), John Goodman (Big Lebowski), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Alan Arkin (Edward Scissorhands) and Victor Garber (Titanic). The ending is by far the most intense ending I have seen in a long time, visually presented in such an astounding way.\n\nDirector Ben Affleck started out his auteur career after his directional debut Gone Baby Gone became critically acclaimed, three years later The Town came out with an Oscar nomination.

So I was truly delighted to enjoy this movie so much. It had a lot to live up to.\n\nThe first thing I must say is that it is exquisitely photographed. The atmosphere set by the beautiful cinematography, is perfect. The film deserves to be nominated for an Oscar on that basis alone. I am in awe of the technical crew and director who could find such unspoiled vistas and such perfect weather in England, and I say that as a Brit who used to live very close to some of the eastern England locations! I sat right through to the end of the credits to see where it was shot, because I assumed it must have been filmed in some remote, rural, continental European locale. I felt quite ashamed that I had doubted the ability of my native land to still provide such delightful scenery! The mist rising off early morning fields, geese on a perfect farm pond, magnificent country estates and enormous trees more usually associated with California than England. Also perfect were the interiors. The air of genteel poverty in which the Bennets lived was well captured. The slightly down at heel scruffiness of the Bennet's farm and house, and the general dirtiness of 18th century life for most people, contrasted well with the ridiculous, rich fussiness of Lady Catherine de Bourg's house and the stark, museum-like beauty of Darcy's home.\n\nThe cast were excellent. I thought Rosamunde Pike as Jane Bennet was perfect, Simon Woods as Mr Bingley was charming although perhaps a little too puppyish, I enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn as Mr and Mrs Bennet and I'm one who thinks Matthew MacFadyen did a very good job as Mr Darcy, a characterization which was slightly more user-friendly than Colin Firth's 1995 Darcy. Also outstanding were Claudie Blakley as plain Charlotte Lucas, rescued from a life of unmarried oblivion by pompous Mr Collins (a very good Tom Hollander) and Kelly Reilly, as the bitchy Miss Bingley. Is Rupert Friend (Mr Wickham) destined to play Orlando Bloom's brother? Am I alone in seeing a similarity? Of course, Keira Knightley plays the title role of Elizabeth. I have followed her career closely since Bend it Like Beckham, and I thought this easily her best acting performance so far. She captured the playfulness and wit of Lizzie's bright mind wonderfully well, and made me think long and hard how truly frustrating it must have been to be an intelligent young woman in a world that expected nothing more of her than an ability to choose ribbon and to capture a husband possessed of money. The only possible slight criticism I might make, is that Keira Knightley is perhaps a little too waif-like to pull off the 18th century characterization entirely convincingly. She is stunningly beautiful, but her stick thin appearance alongside her more robust looking screen sisters, made her look as if Mr Bennet might well have doubted her parentage!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":278163,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"pride and prejudice,england,gentleman,bachelor,prejudice","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pride &amp; Prejudice","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3045130521","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOTY1MDktM2IxMy00MTA4LWI4NjEtNWM1ZjNmMWJmMzkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOTY1MDktM2IxMy00MTA4LWI4NjEtNWM1ZjNmMWJmMzkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Focus Features"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532193/","name":"Matthew Macfadyen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000950/","name":"Brenda Blethyn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942504/","name":"Joe Wright"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0595738/","name":"Deborah Moggach"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000807/","name":"Jane Austen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000668/","name":"Emma Thompson"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Wallace i njegov pas Gromit započeli su potpuno novi posao - pekarnicu "Top Bun". No postoji jedan problem - ostali lokalni pekari u gradu nestaju jedan po jedan... Je li Wallace sljedeći na redu? Wallace i Gromit započeli su novi posao pečenja kruha, "Top Bun", i pretvorili svoju kuću u Ulici West Wallaby 62 u žitnicu s peći, robotskim rukama za miješenje i staromodnom vjetrenjačom na krovu. Transformacija je savršena. Iako posao cvjeta, Gromit je zabrinut zbog vijesti da je desetak lokalnih pekara "nestalo" ove godine - ali Wallace se ne brine. On je previše rastresen i zaljubljen u bivšu ljepoticu i krušnu entuzijasticu, Piellu Bakewell. Dok oni uživaju, Gromit ubrzo shvaća da je život njegova gospodara u opasnosti te postaje detektiv kako bi riješio misteriozni slučaj u onome što ubrzo postaje "pitanje kruha i života".</desc>

This is the movie for you... for at least the first 100 minutes. Then there is a generic action ending where the good guys fight the bad guys.\n\nI think that a lot of people giving this movie low review are comparing it to movies like The Matrix or other films that were critically acclaimed and had a lot of CGI. The CGI out of Russia is improving, and I don't think that the 'cartoon-y' element is necessarily a detriment to the movie.\n\nSo overall, if you went into this expecting Roger Rabbit, you're going to get Cool World, and it'll really be a 2/10.

This is the movie for you... for at least the first 100 minutes. Then there is a generic action ending where the good guys fight the bad guys.\n\nI think that a lot of people giving this movie low review are comparing it to movies like The Matrix or other films that were critically acclaimed and had a lot of CGI. The CGI out of Russia is improving, and I don't think that the 'cartoon-y' element is necessarily a detriment to the movie.\n\nSo overall, if you went into this expecting Roger Rabbit, you're going to get Cool World, and it'll really be a 2/10. If you want a fun and visually exciting movie that you can watch for 2 hours and shut your brain off... solid 7.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2020,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Sport"],"datePublished":"2020-08-27","keywords":"ballgame","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3923099929","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBhMDc3YTItNTZmOS00MWNjLWIzNTgtMDExOWM2YmZiMjYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBhMDc3YTItNTZmOS00MWNjLWIzNTgtMDExOWM2YmZiMjYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5030374/","name":"Viktoriya Agalakova","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11200820/","name":"Georgiy Bestaev","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11195464/","name":"Khristina Blokhina"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0265747/","name":"Dzhanik Fayziev"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0137977/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0366962/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0654880/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0265747/","name":"Dzhanik Fayziev","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7416378/","name":"Twister Murchison","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9156736/","name":"Drew Row"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It had everything a great Pixar film has: a wonderful setting, fantastic CGI, beautiful and interesting characters, and a lot of heart. In fact, Merida alone was such an interesting and adorable character, that it was instantly on my to watch list. Granted, this isn't Pixar's best, but that's holding it up to extremely high standards. As an animated film, however, this is a fantastic and fascinating film, a treat for the summer.\n\nBrave tells the story of the aforementioned Merida, a young, Scottish princess whose life is controlled by her mother so that she can be shaped into a queen someday over the surrounding tribes. In an effort to change her fate and be free of her oppressive, but loving mother, she attempts to change her fate, and in the process makes a huge mistake. I won't get into plot details, as the trailer really doesn't give a lot away in terms of what this film is really about, but suffice to say, there is plenty of fun and adventure to be had.\n\nPixar always manages to create an interesting and unique tale, and this goes right up there with the best of them. Using the Scottish highlands is both an inspiring choice and allows them to craft a beautiful film. With sweeping mountains, water, and thick and colorful forests, this is one of Pixar's best looking films to date. It trumps the jungles of UP and even the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo. There is a certain amount of magic in the environments alone, and gazing on it is a wonder. The characters are also fantastic. Merida is a wonderful addition to Disney's princess lineup, and unlike those others, she is no damsel in distress. She, like her mother, is perfectly capable of handling herself, with her trusty archery skills and even tackles a few dangerous situations on her own instead of having someone there to save her. In fact, this could be seen as an inverse, as Merida actually becomes a hero in many ways and triumphs over the males in her own age bracket. Also of note is Billy Connolly, voicing Fergus, who lends his comedic chops to create a wonderful and likable character.\n\nWhile this film may not be up there with Pixar's best, it still has a wonderful story and character interaction. Merida's relationship with her family feels genuine and most children will probably be able to relate. At the heart of the story is her relationship with her mother. This is more than a story about fate, but a story about obligations to family and how growing up means taking responsibility and putting away childish selfishness in place of those responsibilities. Although the core plot is unconventional and unexpected, it has a fantastic heart and once again proves that Pixar can tell a story like no other.\n\nBrave is an entertaining, humorous, and heartfelt story that will be wonderful for kids and adults alike. Merida is a wonderful new character and the entire film looks beautiful. Even if you don't have children, I recommend this film if you've loved other Pixar's before it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":392722,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-08-15","keywords":"princess,mother daughter relationship,archery,female warrior,rebellious daughter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Families Legend","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi678863641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTM4NTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA4MDI3Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTM4NTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA4MDI3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Determined to make her own path in life, Princess Merida defies a custom that brings chaos to her kingdom.

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long "suffering" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.\n\n I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":430315,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-01-09","keywords":"storytelling,fish,father son relationship,death of father,flashback","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1493149209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A son tries to learn more about his dying father by reliving stories and myths he told about his life."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001082/","name":"Billy Crudup"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000318/","name":"Tim Burton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021095/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093750/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1180620/","name":"Daniel Wallace"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long "suffering" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.\n\n I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":430315,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-01-09","keywords":"storytelling,fish,father son relationship,death of father,flashback","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1493149209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A son tries to learn more about his dying father by reliving stories and myths he told about his life.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001082/","name":"Billy Crudup"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000318/","name":"Tim Burton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021095/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093750/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1180620/","name":"Daniel Wallace","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":702453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":702453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"],"duration":"PT2H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Nakon što je predsjednik SAD-a odstupio, a Selina položila prisegu na kraju treće sezone, četvrta sezona počinje tako što predsjednica Meyer mora održati svoj prvi veliki govor, iako ostaje neizvjesno hoće li joj mandat biti dulji od mandata Williama Henryja Harrisona koji je najkraće obavljao predsjedničku dužnost u američkoj povijesti.</desc>

I think it's quite interesting because of the script, characters and settings. A tense and raw experience.\n\nSecond, acting here is amazing in general, but specially from Collin Farrell. I think his character is the best. Brutal, savage and pretty well performed by Collin. Probably, his best acting in years.\n\nLast, I haven't read the book yet to clarify the plot holes in the series. I'm not sure why we don't know more about several characters and what happened to them.\n\nOn the contrary, last episode was the weakest one. Specially the last 20 minutes are extremely predictable to conclude the story. A wasted opportunity tu create something excellent.\n\nSo, to sum up, if you liked series like The Terror (season 1), I suggest to watch this show.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2021-09-10","keywords":"19th century,whaler,doctor,sailing ship,arctic","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1925239/","name":"Jack O'Connell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0819874/","name":"Sam Spruell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0230132/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010810/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi285523993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE1ZDQwYmUtNjU4NS00NWNkLWIzMWMtYmJhMzE0ZTlhNmNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE1ZDQwYmUtNjU4NS00NWNkLWIzMWMtYmJhMzE0ZTlhNmNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"The North Water premieres July 15 exclusively on AMC+."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I think it's quite interesting because of the script, characters and settings. A tense and raw experience.\n\nSecond, acting here is amazing in general, but specially from Collin Farrell. I think his character is the best. Brutal, savage and pretty well performed by Collin. Probably, his best acting in years.\n\nLast, I haven't read the book yet to clarify the plot holes in the series. I'm not sure why we don't know more about several characters and what happened to them.\n\nOn the contrary, last episode was the weakest one. Specially the last 20 minutes are extremely predictable to conclude the story. A wasted opportunity tu create something excellent.\n\nSo, to sum up, if you liked series like The Terror (season 1), I suggest to watch this show.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2021-09-10","keywords":"19th century,whaler,doctor,sailing ship,arctic","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1925239/","name":"Jack O'Connell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0819874/","name":"Sam Spruell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0230132/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010810/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi285523993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE1ZDQwYmUtNjU4NS00NWNkLWIzMWMtYmJhMzE0ZTlhNmNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE1ZDQwYmUtNjU4NS00NWNkLWIzMWMtYmJhMzE0ZTlhNmNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"The North Water premieres July 15 exclusively on AMC+."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Other than that, I really didn't know what to expect.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised in a few ways. Matthew Perry was playing his usual goofy character, as a result of total lack of any acting ability whatsoever. But Bruce Willis is always good, Amanda Peet stole the screen in almost every scene she was in, and the plot line was just quirky enough to be entertaining. Innovative and fresh, I found this film to be more creative than most of what's currently out in the theatres. It didn't have that formula imprint of so many Hollywood films (i.e. take the comedy formula off the shelf and cast it by Friday). I actually laughed out loud at a few moments.\n\nThe movie did go wrong in a couple of places. Being a Montrealer, I noticed a few things that most viewers might have missed. For instance that their obsession with Mayonnaise on hamburgers, which is integral to the plot, isn't based on any reality that I know of as I have yet to find a Montreal restaurant that puts mayonnaise on burgers. Rosanna Arquette's French accent is even worse than mine, even though it's supposedly her character's first language. Matthew Perry's love scenes with Natasha Henstridge are so ridiculously unrealistic, even the non-cynical will yawn. And the director seemed to have an obsession with pointing out Montreal landmarks, even if they had nothing to do with the plot.\n\nThose are small things in the grand context of the movie, though. If you liked movies such as The Big Hit, this is very similar. It's not meant to be taken very seriously, so the plot turns are more for absurdity's sake than for any kind of buildup of suspense. Still, if you're looking for some lighter entertainment, it's a good choice.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":118125,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-02-18","keywords":"hitman,adultery,marriage problems,nudity,bare breasts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4278959641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001612/","name":"Matthew Perry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000275/","name":"Rosanna Arquette"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0528718/","name":"Jonathan Lynn"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043393/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026797/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0140758/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0438449/","name":"Mitchell Kapner"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Other than that, I really didn't know what to expect.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised in a few ways. Matthew Perry was playing his usual goofy character, as a result of total lack of any acting ability whatsoever. But Bruce Willis is always good, Amanda Peet stole the screen in almost every scene she was in, and the plot line was just quirky enough to be entertaining. Innovative and fresh, I found this film to be more creative than most of what's currently out in the theatres. It didn't have that formula imprint of so many Hollywood films (i.e. take the comedy formula off the shelf and cast it by Friday). I actually laughed out loud at a few moments.\n\nThe movie did go wrong in a couple of places. Being a Montrealer, I noticed a few things that most viewers might have missed. For instance that their obsession with Mayonnaise on hamburgers, which is integral to the plot, isn't based on any reality that I know of as I have yet to find a Montreal restaurant that puts mayonnaise on burgers. Rosanna Arquette's French accent is even worse than mine, even though it's supposedly her character's first language. Matthew Perry's love scenes with Natasha Henstridge are so ridiculously unrealistic, even the non-cynical will yawn. And the director seemed to have an obsession with pointing out Montreal landmarks, even if they had nothing to do with the plot.\n\nThose are small things in the grand context of the movie, though. If you liked movies such as The Big Hit, this is very similar. It's not meant to be taken very seriously, so the plot turns are more for absurdity's sake than for any kind of buildup of suspense. Still, if you're looking for some lighter entertainment, it's a good choice.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":118125,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-02-18","keywords":"hitman,adultery,marriage problems,nudity,bare breasts","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4278959641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001612/","name":"Matthew Perry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000275/","name":"Rosanna Arquette"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0528718/","name":"Jonathan Lynn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043393/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026797/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0140758/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0438449/","name":"Mitchell Kapner"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Twelve Monkeys: Directed by Terry Gilliam. With Joseph Melito, Bruce Willis, Jon Seda, Michael Chance.

And yet I still love this unusual time travel tale: it's got great performances, with a particularly strong turn from the then up-and-coming Brad Pitt, and Gilliam's chaotic storytelling actually suits the inherent madness of the whole movie. The twisty-turny plot keeps the viewer on their toes throughout, and Gilliam pulls all the threads together neatly for the finale. The occasional moment of visual excess still niggles (the steampunk/trash-heap aesthetic of the future isn't my cup of tea), but on the whole this is definitely one of the director's best films.\n\nBruce Willis stars as James Cole, a convict from the future who is sent to the past to try and discover the origins of the virus that wiped out most of the world's human population.

And yet I still love this unusual time travel tale: it's got great performances, with a particularly strong turn from the then up-and-coming Brad Pitt, and Gilliam's chaotic storytelling actually suits the inherent madness of the whole movie. The twisty-turny plot keeps the viewer on their toes throughout, and Gilliam pulls all the threads together neatly for the finale. The occasional moment of visual excess still niggles (the steampunk/trash-heap aesthetic of the future isn't my cup of tea), but on the whole this is definitely one of the director's best films.\n\nBruce Willis stars as James Cole, a convict from the future who is sent to the past to try and discover the origins of the virus that wiped out most of the world's human population. After a violent altercation with the police of 1990, Cole is sent to an asylum where he meets patient Jeffrey Goines (Pitt), son of a wealthy scientist (played by Christopher Plummer), and quite possibly plants the seeds of mankind's destruction in the lunatic's mind.

Dirljiv i inspirativan film donosi priču zasnovanu na istinitim događajima o čuvenom "Slikaru svetla", Tomasu Kinkejdu. Vraćajući se kući sa koledža za jedan Božić, mladi umetnik Tomas Kinkejd shvata da je propao pokušaj promovisanja turizma u njegovom rodnom gradiću i da je njegova majka Marijana na ivici da izgubi porodičnu kolibu koja je pod hipotekom. Inspirisan svojim mentorom Glenom koji živi u susedstvu, Tom prihvata da oslika mural svog malog, idiličnog gradića. Uz Glenovu pomoć, Tom ne samo što će otkriti šta znači biti umetnik, već će pomoći i svojim sugrađanima da otkriju pravo značenje Božića u ovoj nostalgičnoj, zabavnoj i toploj priči koja spada u praznične klasike.</desc>

Priča počinje 2035. godine. Tajanstveni virus je krajem 1996. počistio čovečanstvo, a preživeli su se sklonili u podzemlje. Uspevaju da naprave vremensku mašinu i u prošlost šalju Džejmsa Kola sa zadatkom da otkrije tajanstvenu armiju 12 majmuna koja je, kako legende kažu, raširila virus.

Those facts alone make this sometimes rather tepid film interesting enough to sit through. Screenwriter William Wheeler has adapted Irving's book into a study of the 1970s and Lasse Hallström gives it just the right balance between soft crime and strange comedy to keep it afloat.\n\nClifford Irving (Richard Gere) is down on his literary luck, searching for the right kind of story that will set is publisher Andrea Tate (Hope Davis) on fire. Irving wife Edith (Marcia Gay Harden) is an active painter and doesn't give Irving the support he gets from his pal Dick Suskind (Alfred Molina), but on the messy floor of Edith's studio is a rag magazine with a cover picture of the mysterious Howard Hughes and bingo! up comes the idea for an 'autobiography' of the wizard as confided to Irving and researched by Suskind. That is really the plot then, how these two men squirm around lies and good luck to forge papers and gain the favor of the publishers. Of course it all caves in, but in the publicity about the book Nixon's secrets are revealed and the rest is history.\n\nGere, Molina, Harden, Davis, Stanley Tucci, Julie Delphy and Eli Wallach add immeasurably to the success of the film. No, it is not a heavy story, but the scandalous years of the 1970s are treated realistically and provide a lot of memories, both good and bad, about how we all changed in that post Vietnam time. Worth watching for that!

In what would cause a fantastic media frenzy, Clifford Irving sells his bogus biography of Howard Hughes to a premiere publishing house in the early 1970s." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0462338/","name":"The Hoax","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzkxNmFhY2QtYjI5Yy00NDA0LTgzYmUtY2Y0NjVjYWUwY2MwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"In what would cause a fantastic media frenzy, Clifford Irving sells his bogus biography of Howard Hughes to a premiere publishing house in the early 1970s.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0462338/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"gradyharp","dateCreated":"2007-10-18","inLanguage":"English","name":"Ramifications of a Hoax","reviewBody":"Clifford Irving (Fake, Trial, Final Argument, The Spring) became a sort of national hero when he contrived to publish 'The Autobiography of Howard Hughes', a 400 page phony but well researched book that, while it was never published, did cause enough of a stir among the New York publishing cognoscenti and those surrounding the then President Richard Nixon that it now is recognized as a HOAX of writing that triggered the final discovery of the Watergate Scandal and the subsequent dethroning of Nixon. Those facts alone make this sometimes rather tepid film interesting enough to sit through. Screenwriter William Wheeler has adapted Irving's book into a study of the 1970s and Lasse Hallström gives it just the right balance between soft crime and strange comedy to keep it afloat.\n\nClifford Irving (Richard Gere) is down on his literary luck, searching for the right kind of story that will set is publisher Andrea Tate (Hope Davis) on fire. Irving wife Edith (Marcia Gay Harden) is an active painter and doesn't give Irving the support he gets from his pal Dick Suskind (Alfred Molina), but on the messy floor of Edith's studio is a rag magazine with a cover picture of the mysterious Howard Hughes and bingo! up comes the idea for an 'autobiography' of the wizard as confided to Irving and researched by Suskind. That is really the plot then, how these two men squirm around lies and good luck to forge papers and gain the favor of the publishers. Of course it all caves in, but in the publicity about the book Nixon's secrets are revealed and the rest is history.\n\nGere, Molina, Harden, Davis, Stanley Tucci, Julie Delphy and Eli Wallach add immeasurably to the success of the film. No, it is not a heavy story, but the scandalous years of the 1970s are treated realistically and provide a lot of memories, both good and bad, about how we all changed in that post Vietnam time. Worth watching for that!

The reason is that this is actually a TV show cut to make a film. This film also exists in an episodic format, with more minutes I believe.\n\nThe TV-quality is the biggest flaw with the film. The cinematography is not great. No attention is given to color grading. Lighting is also weak. Scenes in a prison cell at night have too much light. Camera movement is not good. The camera captures what's in front of it, but doesn't do what cinema cameras do - move, pan, tilt, etc. \n\nI'm not nitpicking. We have to mention these things because we want the cinema of Serbia to improve. These advanced ideas do exist in some Serbian films but not so much in Serbian TV, which is stuck in the 90's. So when someone makes a Serbian film out of a TV production, it looks old. Not 1914 old, but 1994 old.\n\nThe acting is good, but I'm surprised by the casting a little. Could they not find a German-speaking actor to play Rudy? Or someone not fluent in Serbo-Croatian to play the Czech Malek? Why is so little attention given to accents?\n\nI don't care if someone has a 2000's Belgrade accent when he's supposed to be a Bosnian peasant from 1914, but did Rudy really speak so fluently and eloquently in Serbo-Croatian? What about Malek? Couldn't they have brought a Slovene or someone with an imperfect accent?\n\nThose are my complaints.\n\nThe rest of the film is very, very good. The acting is convincing. There is no overacting or wooden acting. The music was good, but I felt that they could've given more time to music, either bands, radio or score. Music is a tool and it wasn't used much in this film. \n\nEverything looked convincing, like it was 1914. \n\nIt was well-researched and there were no short-cuts taken. \n\nIt did not fall to modern political bickering. I'm not going to call it a pro-Yugo film, but it felt like one (and that's a good thing in my book.) Many Slavs lived under Austro-Hungarian occupation and annexation and there were both Pro-Yugoslav and Pan-Slavic movements. It just happens that these boys decided to act on it.\n\nThere aren't enough shots of the country. A lot of stuff happens indoors. It's not hard to do establishing shots or mood setting exterior shots (fields, buildings, etc.) \n\nThis film is a very educational film. It gives you the sense of the time in many ways. But this film is not for everyone. It is a legal drama more than anything. I like that kind of thing, but many don't. If you like courtroom shows and like historical stories, this one is for you.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":615,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-10-14","keywords":"male full frontal nudity,male pubic hair,pubic hair,prison,male nudity","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1381367/","name":"Nikola Rakocevic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0467451/","name":"Vuk Kostic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322977/","name":"Nebojsa Glogovac"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464123/","name":"Srdjan Koljevic"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232523/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464123/","name":"Srdjan Koljevic"}],"duration":"PT2H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Was the Kragujevac Massacre precipitated by a Communist Partisan guerrilla attack against German troops?\n\nThis is how the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum describes the events that led up to the Kragujevac massacre: "In response to the capture of the 6th Company of the 920th Security (Landesschuetzen) Battalion by Cetnik resistance fighters in the town of Gorni Milanovac on 28 September 1941, the overall Wehrmacht commander in Serbia, General Franz Boehme, sent German troops to the area to carry out reprisal actions."\n\nAccording to this account, it was Chetnik guerrillas under Draza Mihailovich that sparked the events that followed. The movie seeks to be politically correct and reflects the Communist orthodoxy or ideology or Party line, however, that it was only the Partisans that were engaged in guerrilla activity. As a movie made during the height of the Communist dictatorship of Josip Broz Tito, this type of falsification is to be expected. The most glaring inaccuracy is with regard to the time of year depicted in the movie. The actual Kragujevac massacre occurred in the fall, October 21, 1941. In the movie, however, the time of year appears to be spring or summer with the corn fields just planted. The German tanks used in the movie appear to be inaccurate historically. The Germans used the Panzerkampfwagen Mark III and captured French Somua S35 tanks in the Kragujevac region in 1941. The tanks and personnel carriers used in the film appear to be improvised types that are not historically accurate. The German personnel carriers, in particular, stand out as anachronistic and ones not used by German forces at that time or place. The German tanks appear to be U.S. M4 Sherman E4 series medium tanks with 76 mm guns produced in the early 1950s which the U.S. shipped to Yugoslavia after the 1948 Stalin-Tito split for use in the Yugoslav Army. \n\nThere are other problems of historical accuracy as well. Why would the Germans broadcast on the radio a speech by Adolf Hitler from the 1934 documentary Triumph of the Will? In German? Moreover, Rudolf Hess is heard following the Hitler speech. Hess, however, had flown to Scotland on May 10, 1941 and been captured in an unsuccessful attempt to recruit Britain as an ally before the German invasion of the USSR. Clearly, historical accuracy, verisimilitude, and cinema verite are not high priorities of the movie. The screenwriter Branimir Jankovic is not a historian and the research involved was not very thorough or extensive.\n\nWere children executed? The Germans executed males between the ages of 16 to 60. In the movie, children under 16 are shown being executed. This was obviously for dramatic effect and to heighten the pathos and emotional impact.\n\nHow accurate is the number given of those killed at 8,000 men and boys? This number is obviously inaccurate and grossly inflated and was used by the Tito regime to hype up the massacre. The most recent determination of the number of persons killed in the massacre is 2,794 men shot, 415 in villages and 2,379 in the city of Kragujevac.\n\nThe movie is marred by the need to present the Communist Party line or historical orthodoxy on the events depicted. These instances are relatively brief in the movie. If one can overlook these intrusions, the movie works. The metaphor or theme of the movie is subservience or acquiescence to force or overwhelming power. Should one collaborate with the occupiers or should one resist? This is the overarching theme of the movie. The metaphor for this theme is the scene where German officers force the children to shine their shoes. The children choose defiance and resistance, choosing to die rather than to submit. On this level, the movie is successful in appealing to transcendent and universal human traits. Should one fight or should one submit? How do you respond to military occupation? Should one be a "traitor", "quisling", a "collaborator". Or should one resist and oppose force? In a movie, the choices are always easy or easier because actors do not die. They live to act in other movies. In real life, choices on whether to resist involve real consequences. Is it better to resist and to face death or is it better to endure occupation and oppression? One lives to fight another day. But most importantly, one lives, one survives. These can be difficult and controversial questions. But they are not ones that are presented only in movies and in fiction. These are universal human dilemmas that all people in any country and in any time can relate to. They are dilemmas that have always faced mankind and continue to do so. Can military occupation lead to peace and stability? In Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, and Bosnia? These are issues that still are relevant because they represent fundamental and transcendent human values.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":175,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"genre":["War"],"datePublished":"1969-10-17","keywords":"massacre,kragujevac,mass murder,german,child","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586759/","name":"Zorica Miladinovic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0836267/","name":"Mira Stupica"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017988/","name":"Mija Aleksic"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417732/","name":"Branimir Tori Jankovic"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069692/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000507/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417732/","name":"Branimir Tori Jankovic"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Was the Kragujevac Massacre precipitated by a Communist Partisan guerrilla attack against German troops?\n\nThis is how the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum describes the events that led up to the Kragujevac massacre: "In response to the capture of the 6th Company of the 920th Security (Landesschuetzen) Battalion by Cetnik resistance fighters in the town of Gorni Milanovac on 28 September 1941, the overall Wehrmacht commander in Serbia, General Franz Boehme, sent German troops to the area to carry out reprisal actions."\n\nAccording to this account, it was Chetnik guerrillas under Draza Mihailovich that sparked the events that followed. The movie seeks to be politically correct and reflects the Communist orthodoxy or ideology or Party line, however, that it was only the Partisans that were engaged in guerrilla activity. As a movie made during the height of the Communist dictatorship of Josip Broz Tito, this type of falsification is to be expected. The most glaring inaccuracy is with regard to the time of year depicted in the movie. The actual Kragujevac massacre occurred in the fall, October 21, 1941. In the movie, however, the time of year appears to be spring or summer with the corn fields just planted. The German tanks used in the movie appear to be inaccurate historically. The Germans used the Panzerkampfwagen Mark III and captured French Somua S35 tanks in the Kragujevac region in 1941. The tanks and personnel carriers used in the film appear to be improvised types that are not historically accurate. The German personnel carriers, in particular, stand out as anachronistic and ones not used by German forces at that time or place. The German tanks appear to be U.S. M4 Sherman E4 series medium tanks with 76 mm guns produced in the early 1950s which the U.S. shipped to Yugoslavia after the 1948 Stalin-Tito split for use in the Yugoslav Army. \n\nThere are other problems of historical accuracy as well. Why would the Germans broadcast on the radio a speech by Adolf Hitler from the 1934 documentary Triumph of the Will? In German? Moreover, Rudolf Hess is heard following the Hitler speech. Hess, however, had flown to Scotland on May 10, 1941 and been captured in an unsuccessful attempt to recruit Britain as an ally before the German invasion of the USSR. Clearly, historical accuracy, verisimilitude, and cinema verite are not high priorities of the movie. The screenwriter Branimir Jankovic is not a historian and the research involved was not very thorough or extensive.\n\nWere children executed? The Germans executed males between the ages of 16 to 60. In the movie, children under 16 are shown being executed. This was obviously for dramatic effect and to heighten the pathos and emotional impact.\n\nHow accurate is the number given of those killed at 8,000 men and boys? This number is obviously inaccurate and grossly inflated and was used by the Tito regime to hype up the massacre. The most recent determination of the number of persons killed in the massacre is 2,794 men shot, 415 in villages and 2,379 in the city of Kragujevac.\n\nThe movie is marred by the need to present the Communist Party line or historical orthodoxy on the events depicted. These instances are relatively brief in the movie. If one can overlook these intrusions, the movie works. The metaphor or theme of the movie is subservience or acquiescence to force or overwhelming power. Should one collaborate with the occupiers or should one resist? This is the overarching theme of the movie. The metaphor for this theme is the scene where German officers force the children to shine their shoes. The children choose defiance and resistance, choosing to die rather than to submit. On this level, the movie is successful in appealing to transcendent and universal human traits. Should one fight or should one submit? How do you respond to military occupation? Should one be a "traitor", "quisling", a "collaborator". Or should one resist and oppose force? In a movie, the choices are always easy or easier because actors do not die. They live to act in other movies. In real life, choices on whether to resist involve real consequences. Is it better to resist and to face death or is it better to endure occupation and oppression? One lives to fight another day. But most importantly, one lives, one survives. These can be difficult and controversial questions. But they are not ones that are presented only in movies and in fiction. These are universal human dilemmas that all people in any country and in any time can relate to. They are dilemmas that have always faced mankind and continue to do so. Can military occupation lead to peace and stability? In Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, and Bosnia? These are issues that still are relevant because they represent fundamental and transcendent human values.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":175,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"genre":["War"],"datePublished":"1969-10-17","keywords":"massacre,kragujevac,mass murder,german,child","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586759/","name":"Zorica Miladinovic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0836267/","name":"Mira Stupica"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017988/","name":"Mija Aleksic"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417732/","name":"Branimir Tori Jankovic"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069692/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000507/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417732/","name":"Branimir Tori Jankovic"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A great movie after the first one. MI:II is must not be considered an MI movie, but this one here builds the foundation to take the series further. We get an insight of Hunt's life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt's dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films. The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt's super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building. Got to say, Hunt is very lucky to survive so many life and death situation.\n\nThe acting was on point, the other characters other than Hunt hadn't have any significant challenges in acting considering the calibre of them. Tom Cruise grew as an actor and it showed if his performance from first two filmshas to be considered. I wish the movie was less predictable and avoided the cliches. It's a good movie to pass your time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":344222,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-17","keywords":"ethan hunt character,luther stickell character,tape over mouth,tough woman,italy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Mission: Impossible III","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1587151129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBlNGVmZjQtNjMwOC00N2ZiLTllNWUtMWY0MzRlNWVlMjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBlNGVmZjQtNjMwOC00N2ZiLTllNWUtMWY0MzRlNWVlMjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Paramount"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1157358/","name":"Michelle Monaghan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009190/","name":"J.J.

A great movie after the first one. MI:II is must not be considered an MI movie, but this one here builds the foundation to take the series further. We get an insight of Hunt's life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt's dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films. The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt's super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building. Got to say, Hunt is very lucky to survive so many life and death situation.\n\nThe acting was on point, the other characters other than Hunt hadn't have any significant challenges in acting considering the calibre of them. Tom Cruise grew as an actor and it showed if his performance from first two filmshas to be considered. I wish the movie was less predictable and avoided the cliches. It's a good movie to pass your time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":344222,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-17","keywords":"ethan hunt character,luther stickell character,tape over mouth,tough woman,italy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Mission: Impossible III","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1587151129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBlNGVmZjQtNjMwOC00N2ZiLTllNWUtMWY0MzRlNWVlMjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBlNGVmZjQtNjMwOC00N2ZiLTllNWUtMWY0MzRlNWVlMjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Paramount","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1157358/","name":"Michelle Monaghan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009190/","name":"J.J.

I didn't expect it to be anything like "First Blood," but why would I like this one if I did?\n\n"Rambo III" was based in Afghanistan, which was really relevant in 1988. The Afghans fought the invading Russians from about 1979 to 1989. The U.S. had a rooting interest in that conflict because Russia was our biggest threat on the world stage. "Rambo III" did a fine job in limiting any U.S. rhetoric and focused on the people of Afghanistan and their plight, because after all, they were the ones being slaughtered and displaced, not Americans.\n\n"Rambo III" made an action movie into a human interest movie in a smooth fluid manner. Yes, Rambo wanted to save his Colonel, but it's clear the movie didn't want to overlook the Afghan people and make it all about Rambo and Colonel Murdock (Charles Napier).\n\nEarly in the movie Rambo said that his favorite sport was football. Later in the movie we got a football moment when Rambo, in a tank, went head up with the Russian commander who was in a gunship helicopter.

A great movie after the first one. MI:II is must not be considered an MI movie, but this one here builds the foundation to take the series further. We get an insight of Hunt's life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt's dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films. The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt's super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building. Got to say, Hunt is very lucky to survive so many life and death situation.\n\nThe acting was on point, the other characters other than Hunt hadn't have any significant challenges in acting considering the calibre of them. Tom Cruise grew as an actor and it showed if his performance from first two filmshas to be considered. I wish the movie was less predictable and avoided the cliches. It's a good movie to pass your time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":344222,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-17","keywords":"ethan hunt character,luther stickell character,tape over mouth,tough woman,italy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Mission: Impossible III","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1587151129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBlNGVmZjQtNjMwOC00N2ZiLTllNWUtMWY0MzRlNWVlMjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBlNGVmZjQtNjMwOC00N2ZiLTllNWUtMWY0MzRlNWVlMjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Paramount"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1157358/","name":"Michelle Monaghan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009190/","name":"J.J.

A great movie after the first one. MI:II is must not be considered an MI movie, but this one here builds the foundation to take the series further. We get an insight of Hunt's life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt's dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films. The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt's super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building. Got to say, Hunt is very lucky to survive so many life and death situation.\n\nThe acting was on point, the other characters other than Hunt hadn't have any significant challenges in acting considering the calibre of them. Tom Cruise grew as an actor and it showed if his performance from first two filmshas to be considered. I wish the movie was less predictable and avoided the cliches. It's a good movie to pass your time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":344222,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-17","keywords":"ethan hunt character,luther stickell character,tape over mouth,tough woman,italy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Mission: Impossible III","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1587151129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBlNGVmZjQtNjMwOC00N2ZiLTllNWUtMWY0MzRlNWVlMjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBlNGVmZjQtNjMwOC00N2ZiLTllNWUtMWY0MzRlNWVlMjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Paramount","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1157358/","name":"Michelle Monaghan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009190/","name":"J.J.

An acceptable noir film produced by actor Andrew Stevens , Elie Samaha and professionally directed by Stephen Kay (Boogeyman , The last time I committed suicide), though with no originality . An extremely tough movie burdened by cruel murders and seedy characters , based on a novel titled 'Get Carter' by Ted Lewis from 1970 . This brutal , austere crime-thriller focuses a cheerless enforcer Jack Carter (hard-working star Sylvester Stallone) , a tough , amoral gangster who works as a killer in Los Angeles . Passable Sylvester Stallone in the title role , but inferior to Michael Caine (he played Jack Carter in the original) here playing a secondary role as Cliff Brumby (his character was only in one scene in the original cut, but test audiences said they liked him and they transformed the movie to have Caine as the bad guy) .

Carter aware the murder of his brother at the hands of a "gang" opponent led by a mobster . We see as his facade of sophisticated and elegant mob gentleman with exquisite manners , educated pose , and expensive costumes , begins collapsing , leaving see the lascivious, malleability and a cold killer . Carter starts moving in this ambient but all of this ends in a shocking discovery delivered by a compact disc which greatly angers Carter . This triggers a wave of violence that sweeps the the underworld lumpen in Seattle . Carter keeps the things moving along until ending vendetta. The end of the film is like a summary of the entire story for the scenarios that uses austere bleak and cold environment .\n\nThis interesting film features thrills , well-staged car chases , raw energy , adult subject matter , clunking cruelty surrounding , lots of violence and enlivened by high-powered performances . Plenty of intrigue, atmospheric music ,noisy action and grisly killings until impressive finale vengeance . It is a very violent film , depressing charismatic , magnificently set , but always strong , with a perfect abstraction of a climate of moral misery to game with a colorful photography by magnificent cameraman Mario Fiore .

Stallone plays Frank Leone, who faces multiple prison terms total, beginning with an 18-month sentence he was given for avenging the vicious beating of an old man who took him off the streets when he was a teenager. So back then he wasn't allowed to leave the prison to see his dying father (when we meet him, he is on a weekend leave from a minimum security prison, a weekend that he spends playing ball with his kids while his charming wife looks on approvingly), so he breaks out to go to the funeral. \n\nSo his minor prison sentence turns into a big one, although one that he spends at a comfortable minimum security joint with all kinds of perks, including weekends and conjugals and even friendships with the guards. His release is approaching when suddenly he is awakened in the middle of the night and taken to a brutal, maximum-security prison where he is to spend the rest of his sentence. It's called a "routine transfer," although he has done nothing to deserve such an upgrade in security status and even his wife is not informed of what happened to him.\n\nUltimately he learns that he is being transferred to the prison of Warden Drumgoole (Donald Sutherland at his creepy best), who was in charge of the prison that Leone escaped from, which in turn made it into the papers and ruined Drumgoole's career. Now he has his chance for revenge, and he plans to arrange for Leone to spend the rest of his life in this prison.\n\nThe movie carelessly glosses over the ease with which Drumgoole plucks Leone out of his own prison with no explanation to those in charge there, and the conflict immediately switches to Leone trying to survive in this violent prison and stay out of trouble so he doesn't screw up his chances of getting released on time so he can go back to his family. \n\nDrumgoole pulls out all the stops in violating the law that his institution is designed to uphold so that he can keep this one guy down, and Leone faces all manner of challenges ranging from shank-laden inmates to one of his inmate buddies who steals the Mustang they've all restored together and tears all over the prison yard doing doughnuts.\n\nThe movie is definitely entertaining although there are times when the cheese factor is through the roof, such as the spray paint fight and the downright school-girlish friendship that Leone forms with a small group of other inmates. On the other hand, it also has a much wider target audience than your average prison movie, and it manages to generally avoid most of the gaping pitfalls that prison movies are in danger of falling into when they shoot for a wide audience. There's nothing realistic about it, but for good Stallone entertainment, this is not a bad way to follow up the massive success of the Rambo and Rocky films. \n\nAlso keep your eye out for a young Tom Sizemore, but be advised that the movie features violence, unnecessary cheesiness and may leave you with an overwhelming desire to go out and get some doughnuts","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41935,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1989-08-04","keywords":"warden,male wears underwear,sweat,man wears an undershirt,muscleman","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lock Up","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3348496665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzgwODQxMDAtMWNiMi00Zjc4LWE5ZDYtOTY4OGNmZDA0ZmNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzgwODQxMDAtMWNiMi00Zjc4LWE5ZDYtOTY4OGNmZDA0ZmNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000661/","name":"Donald Sutherland"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0025309/","name":"John Amos"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0283500/","name":"John Flynn"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057362/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094459/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0119038/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0809700/","name":"Richard Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0835732/","name":"Jeb Stuart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0742132/","name":"Henry Rosenbaum"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Stallone plays Frank Leone, who faces multiple prison terms total, beginning with an 18-month sentence he was given for avenging the vicious beating of an old man who took him off the streets when he was a teenager. So back then he wasn't allowed to leave the prison to see his dying father (when we meet him, he is on a weekend leave from a minimum security prison, a weekend that he spends playing ball with his kids while his charming wife looks on approvingly), so he breaks out to go to the funeral. \n\nSo his minor prison sentence turns into a big one, although one that he spends at a comfortable minimum security joint with all kinds of perks, including weekends and conjugals and even friendships with the guards. His release is approaching when suddenly he is awakened in the middle of the night and taken to a brutal, maximum-security prison where he is to spend the rest of his sentence. It's called a "routine transfer," although he has done nothing to deserve such an upgrade in security status and even his wife is not informed of what happened to him.\n\nUltimately he learns that he is being transferred to the prison of Warden Drumgoole (Donald Sutherland at his creepy best), who was in charge of the prison that Leone escaped from, which in turn made it into the papers and ruined Drumgoole's career. Now he has his chance for revenge, and he plans to arrange for Leone to spend the rest of his life in this prison.\n\nThe movie carelessly glosses over the ease with which Drumgoole plucks Leone out of his own prison with no explanation to those in charge there, and the conflict immediately switches to Leone trying to survive in this violent prison and stay out of trouble so he doesn't screw up his chances of getting released on time so he can go back to his family. \n\nDrumgoole pulls out all the stops in violating the law that his institution is designed to uphold so that he can keep this one guy down, and Leone faces all manner of challenges ranging from shank-laden inmates to one of his inmate buddies who steals the Mustang they've all restored together and tears all over the prison yard doing doughnuts.\n\nThe movie is definitely entertaining although there are times when the cheese factor is through the roof, such as the spray paint fight and the downright school-girlish friendship that Leone forms with a small group of other inmates. On the other hand, it also has a much wider target audience than your average prison movie, and it manages to generally avoid most of the gaping pitfalls that prison movies are in danger of falling into when they shoot for a wide audience. There's nothing realistic about it, but for good Stallone entertainment, this is not a bad way to follow up the massive success of the Rambo and Rocky films. \n\nAlso keep your eye out for a young Tom Sizemore, but be advised that the movie features violence, unnecessary cheesiness and may leave you with an overwhelming desire to go out and get some doughnuts","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41935,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1989-08-04","keywords":"warden,male wears underwear,sweat,man wears an undershirt,muscleman","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lock Up","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3348496665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzgwODQxMDAtMWNiMi00Zjc4LWE5ZDYtOTY4OGNmZDA0ZmNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzgwODQxMDAtMWNiMi00Zjc4LWE5ZDYtOTY4OGNmZDA0ZmNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000661/","name":"Donald Sutherland"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0025309/","name":"John Amos"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0283500/","name":"John Flynn"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057362/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094459/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0119038/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0809700/","name":"Richard Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0835732/","name":"Jeb Stuart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0742132/","name":"Henry Rosenbaum"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Drugs comes into focus on a table next to her... \n\nShe rouses herself to sniff some white powder, steps out (completely unbalanced) onto the balcony and stands on the railing, ready to plunge peacefully down... \n\nMel Gibson is remarkable as Martin Riggs... He is talented as both a cop and a clown... His character carries a great level of tension... He is both charismatic and enigmatic... Riggs is a homicide detective suffering harmful levels of stress, after losing his wife in an automobile accident... He seems unstable... He slaps and pummels a drug dealer in the manner of the "Three Stooges," and dares his hostage taker to shoot him...\n\nHe is on the brink of despair... He takes out a bullet, loads it in his .9 millimeter Beretta, puts the gun into his mouth, and appears ready to pull the trigger...\n\nHe is suicidal... He snaps a handcuff on a jumper's wrist, and snaps the other end onto his own wrist... Then he holds up the key to the cuffs, and flings it out into space...\n\nHe is a sharpshooter... He raises his gun and fires without blinking, and claims that killing is "the only thing he could ever do well."\n\nHe is partnered with a black middle-aged police detective to investigate the death of the girl that leaped off the balcony... Both quickly build up a strong friendship that lead them to uncover a very dangerous heroin ring...\n\nDanny Glover is at his best against an actor who can easily steal scenes... He plays an old-fashioned detective who is obsessed about his age, and goes by the book... We simply see him scanning, reading the odds...\n\nMurtaugh - on his 50th birthday - wears his past like a scar... He is a conservative family man who has to follow Riggs' hurtful plan to get his daughter back... \n\nGary Busey plays Mr. Joshua, a trained expert killer, cool as ice, deadly calm... It's essential for him to find out how much the police know... He tries his best to get Riggs out of the picture... His boss the General (Mitch Ryan) is a rugged man with eyes like chips of stone... The ruthless general thinks that it's now the precise time to turn up the heat... He wants Murtaugh to be tortured...

Drugs comes into focus on a table next to her... \n\nShe rouses herself to sniff some white powder, steps out (completely unbalanced) onto the balcony and stands on the railing, ready to plunge peacefully down... \n\nMel Gibson is remarkable as Martin Riggs... He is talented as both a cop and a clown... His character carries a great level of tension... He is both charismatic and enigmatic... Riggs is a homicide detective suffering harmful levels of stress, after losing his wife in an automobile accident... He seems unstable... He slaps and pummels a drug dealer in the manner of the "Three Stooges," and dares his hostage taker to shoot him...\n\nHe is on the brink of despair... He takes out a bullet, loads it in his .9 millimeter Beretta, puts the gun into his mouth, and appears ready to pull the trigger...\n\nHe is suicidal... He snaps a handcuff on a jumper's wrist, and snaps the other end onto his own wrist... Then he holds up the key to the cuffs, and flings it out into space...\n\nHe is a sharpshooter... He raises his gun and fires without blinking, and claims that killing is "the only thing he could ever do well."\n\nHe is partnered with a black middle-aged police detective to investigate the death of the girl that leaped off the balcony... Both quickly build up a strong friendship that lead them to uncover a very dangerous heroin ring...\n\nDanny Glover is at his best against an actor who can easily steal scenes... He plays an old-fashioned detective who is obsessed about his age, and goes by the book... We simply see him scanning, reading the odds...\n\nMurtaugh - on his 50th birthday - wears his past like a scar... He is a conservative family man who has to follow Riggs' hurtful plan to get his daughter back... \n\nGary Busey plays Mr. Joshua, a trained expert killer, cool as ice, deadly calm... It's essential for him to find out how much the police know... He tries his best to get Riggs out of the picture... His boss the General (Mitch Ryan) is a rugged man with eyes like chips of stone... The ruthless general thinks that it's now the precise time to turn up the heat... He wants Murtaugh to be tortured... He kidnaps Murtaugh's little girl, the gorgeous Rianne (Traci Wolfe) to make him speak...\n\nRichard Donner's 'Lethal Weapon' is one of the finest films to offer its audience the combination of strong acting, and scenes out of hell...

Although there are sequels that are as good as their predecessors is nearly better ('Godfather Part II', 'Terminator 2', 'Aliens') there are many others that don't measure up and some even disgracing them.\n\n'Lethal Weapon 2', thank goodness, is not one of those films. But saying that it is almost as good as the first 'Lethal Weapon' is genuinely meant, even if it is not in the same league as the three sequels listed above that are almost as good and nearly better. 'Lethal Weapon 2' has its faults but the good things are many and very obvious to spot.\n\nIt is let down a little by a script that's at times inconsistent, with the tone sometimes forced and confused and like it's trying to do too much. While the action is mostly great, the helicopter scene is somewhat implausible, more so than most of the script in the first film.\n\nMost of the performances are spot on, but two didn't really do it for me. One was Patsy Kensit, who is attractive but looks lost. The other is Joss Ackland's hammy villain who looks like he belongs in another film entirely. Not things that everybody is going to share but just personal opinion.\n\nHowever, like 'Lethal Weapon', the way 'Lethal Weapon 2' is shot and designed screams slick and stylish while Richard Donner once again directs with an assured hand. The score is atmospheric and groovy.\n\nDespite not finding all the script working, a lot of it does with some cracking, sometimes hilarious humour, tension and dark pathos. The story is tightly structured and plotted, with some great tension and always being fun. Loved the bathroom scene, one of the best and most unique on film.\n\nOnce again, the action is slick and bursts with excitement and tension, apart from one that suffers from excessive implausibility. It is very easy to see why the chalk and cheese chemistry of the polar opposite characters of Riggs and Murtaugh became so popular, very rarely in a buddy-cop film has this kind of chemistry been so entertaining and perfectly pitched.\n\nMel Gibson continues to excel in a performance as witty and intense has before. Danny Glover gives Murtaugh the right amount of spirit, subtlety and no-nonsense attitude. They are matched well by Joe Pesci, who is a motormouth delight, and Derrick O'Connor who gives much more of a sinister edge than Ackland (have noticed that in both films that the henchman has always been the more memorable and better played than the lead villain).\n\nIn summary, very well done and just as good. 7/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":170462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1989-07-07","keywords":"krugerrand,two man army,shoulder,holster,squad car","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lethal Weapon 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1963893785","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY0NjYyNWItMTA0ZS00NTA2LWI2ZDctZmNiOGExYzYwOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY0NjYyNWItMTA0ZS00NTA2LWI2ZDctZmNiOGExYzYwOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for Lethal Weapon 2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000154/","name":"Mel Gibson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000418/","name":"Danny Glover"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000582/","name":"Joe Pesci"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001149/","name":"Richard Donner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019968/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0090151/","name":"Jeffrey Boam"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000948/","name":"Shane Black"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0614775/","name":"Warren Murphy"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Lets face it, if they had all just been sitting there doing nothing it would still have been a highly successful film. People would have paid to see them organise their sock draws. However, this time around with a brand new script and an immensely prosperous cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original.\n\nIn the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it. Firstly because of the fact that they all took pay cuts so that it could happen and secondly because it comes across on screen. The easy friendship between Clooney, Pitt, Roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle. We know they had a good time filming it just as we are having a good time watching it.\n\nIt is easy to say that this is THE coolest film of the year. From the phenomenal script and direction from Steven Soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the 'stars' - yes every single one of them! With so many big names you would expect some rivalry yet there is no scene hogging in sight. It is clear to see that they are all willing to share the limelight. The fact is that there is no main character or personality. They are all in it together - reflecting the sense of the film in real life. This is the first concept the audience sees from the poster. The names are printed in alphabetical order. Nobody is given priority. Clooney plays Danny Ocean with the same self - confidence, composure and unmistakable coll that hasn't been seen since Sinatra himself. All the other characters are brand new, that is except for the character of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). In the 60s original Tess, played by Angie Dickinson, is Ocean's defender (to some extent). However, Roberts' re-vamped character is more self assured and unmoved by Ocean's charm. Rusty (Pitt) is rarely seen without snack in hand and the suit are certainly something to look at. He may be a new character but he is still played in the carefree manner typical of the Rat Pack.\n\nIt is refreshing to sit and watch a film such as this and not have to suffer the usual barrage of swearing and violence. The lack of such profanities only increases its wide appeal. It just goes to show that it can be done and that films do not neccessarily need it.\n\nOcean's Eleven is not your typical heist movie. To start with there are eleven people working together all with specific, indispensable jobs to do. Yet the mood is still light hearted which makes it even more compelling to watch. The inspired direction and flowing script assure that there is never a dull moment and that every scene is important, as is every character. There are also a couple of cameo appearances from some other big names to look out for.\n\nAdmittedly there is a bad side as there is in every film. In this instance it is Don Cheadles's cockney accent. Nice try but not quite right!\n\nThis is a film that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking 'that was really clever'. Perhaps it isn't quite what you would expect from such a star studded cast and an Oscar winning director. But that is why it is so much better than the archetypal Hollywood blockbusters that we have come to expect.\n\nThis is no run of the mill film. It was not about money or self promotion. It was about having fun and enjoying the job. Ocean's Eleven is not a film that will be forgotten seconds after you have seen it. It will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545847,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-20","keywords":"casino,heist,criminal mastermind,card dealer,ulcer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Eleven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1822294297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

Lets face it, if they had all just been sitting there doing nothing it would still have been a highly successful film. People would have paid to see them organise their sock draws. However, this time around with a brand new script and an immensely prosperous cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original.\n\nIn the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it. Firstly because of the fact that they all took pay cuts so that it could happen and secondly because it comes across on screen. The easy friendship between Clooney, Pitt, Roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle. We know they had a good time filming it just as we are having a good time watching it.\n\nIt is easy to say that this is THE coolest film of the year. From the phenomenal script and direction from Steven Soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the 'stars' - yes every single one of them! With so many big names you would expect some rivalry yet there is no scene hogging in sight. It is clear to see that they are all willing to share the limelight. The fact is that there is no main character or personality. They are all in it together - reflecting the sense of the film in real life. This is the first concept the audience sees from the poster. The names are printed in alphabetical order. Nobody is given priority. Clooney plays Danny Ocean with the same self - confidence, composure and unmistakable coll that hasn't been seen since Sinatra himself. All the other characters are brand new, that is except for the character of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). In the 60s original Tess, played by Angie Dickinson, is Ocean's defender (to some extent). However, Roberts' re-vamped character is more self assured and unmoved by Ocean's charm. Rusty (Pitt) is rarely seen without snack in hand and the suit are certainly something to look at. He may be a new character but he is still played in the carefree manner typical of the Rat Pack.\n\nIt is refreshing to sit and watch a film such as this and not have to suffer the usual barrage of swearing and violence. The lack of such profanities only increases its wide appeal. It just goes to show that it can be done and that films do not neccessarily need it.\n\nOcean's Eleven is not your typical heist movie. To start with there are eleven people working together all with specific, indispensable jobs to do. Yet the mood is still light hearted which makes it even more compelling to watch. The inspired direction and flowing script assure that there is never a dull moment and that every scene is important, as is every character. There are also a couple of cameo appearances from some other big names to look out for.\n\nAdmittedly there is a bad side as there is in every film. In this instance it is Don Cheadles's cockney accent. Nice try but not quite right!\n\nThis is a film that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking 'that was really clever'. Perhaps it isn't quite what you would expect from such a star studded cast and an Oscar winning director. But that is why it is so much better than the archetypal Hollywood blockbusters that we have come to expect.\n\nThis is no run of the mill film. It was not about money or self promotion. It was about having fun and enjoying the job. Ocean's Eleven is not a film that will be forgotten seconds after you have seen it. It will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545847,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-20","keywords":"casino,heist,criminal mastermind,card dealer,ulcer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Eleven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1822294297","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

The well-known filmmaker is blessed with 2 good writers Dan Fogelman &amp; Jessie Nelson, who've written this Christmas flick. A joyride! \n\nAccoding to me 'Bad Santa' was an excellent attempt, but that was crude and crass. But 'Fred Claus' is the most touching Christmas flick after the Masterpiece 'The Polar Express'. Everything a cine-fan wants to see is served in here, it's a feel-good entertainer that leaves loving your loved ones a bit more.\n\nSanta Claus is not the topic here, it's his brother Fred Claus, who makes this simple story well-told. More than anything, this movie makes you believe in Santa once again, {I was his biggest fan in my childhood}, and after watching it I wish each and every kid in the world awaits for Christmas.\n\nActing-wise: Vince Vaughn plays Fred Claus beautifully.

The well-known filmmaker is blessed with 2 good writers Dan Fogelman &amp; Jessie Nelson, who've written this Christmas flick. A joyride! \n\nAccoding to me 'Bad Santa' was an excellent attempt, but that was crude and crass. But 'Fred Claus' is the most touching Christmas flick after the Masterpiece 'The Polar Express'. Everything a cine-fan wants to see is served in here, it's a feel-good entertainer that leaves loving your loved ones a bit more.\n\nSanta Claus is not the topic here, it's his brother Fred Claus, who makes this simple story well-told. More than anything, this movie makes you believe in Santa once again, I was his biggest fan in my childhood, and after watching it I wish each and every kid in the world awaits for Christmas.\n\nActing-wise: Vince Vaughn plays Fred Claus beautifully. He's dependable as always. Paul Giamatti, as Santa, is lovable. Kevin Spacey plays the conniving-turned-likable character with ease. Miranda Richardson is first-rate.

    <desc lang="hr">The Internship: Directed by Shawn Levy. With Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Rose Byrne, Aasif Mandvi.

This time I'm coming at you with the Internship, the latest comedy starring that dynamic duo Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, who entertained us with Wedding Crashers. Well it seems eight years later the team who helped make that fun comedy have returned to make what many are calling a remake/ knock off of the "romantic" comedy. Is it true, or is there more to this movie than meets the eye? Please read on to hear my opinions. \n\nI'll agree that there are many similarities to the plot of Wedding Crashers. The two smooth talkers seem to be living the dream, until something happens to derail their train and send them on a new path that is for the better. Instead of banging babes and finding true love though, this time it's more about taking a chance and bridging a gap between generations all the while addressing the trials within. This is where one of my strengths of this movie comes in, the relevance of the plot to me. The Internship addresses big problems that faces many today, the security and safety of a job and the challenge that our culture has become. Being a student currently going through similar trials, I found the production team did a good job showing the various struggles that the younger generation faces, and their accompanying Impressing parents, cynical approaches to problems, the substitution of technology for life, and many more issues are all well integrated into this movie to drive the point across. Lucky for the audience it's not done in too cheesy a manner that it makes you think it's an 80's/90's sitcom. Something else I liked was the fact that all of the characters in their intern group had a problem, which allowed for yes you guessed it BALANCE, which we all know I like. Of course it's not just solely a bunch of smart college kids pulling miracles out of the air, and complaining about their problems. No Vaughn and Wilson's characters have their own problems that they had to face as they get integrated into a new world that the younger generation seems to run. Now we've seen these problems before I won't lie, but there is some fresh chemistry between the older generation and newer generation that shows off a dual teacher-student relationship. \n\nWith limited space let's move on to the comedy. The Internship switches gears from odd/awkward sex scenarios that floods the dialog and bounces into the land of stereotypical nerds, generation gaps, and new experiences that go a different route. For me this allowed for some balance in humor, with many of the "inspirational" speeches and geek events making me laugh at points through the movie. Character references from star wars, insults using computer vernacular, and dressing up as literature with some pizazz await those who go to this movie, so be ready for this humor. I like the diversity, and some of the creativity these guys did, but from the responses of the other audience members that wasn't the same case. Don't worry though they still laughed, but more so on the sexual situations that still appear a good number of times. As for the older generation, the team also digs up some references from the previous decades, which although were sometimes over my head, still entertained the audience and me at points. However, this could have been due to the delivery of the lines and acting that went with it.\n\nThis brings me to my next point, the acting. Like Wedding Crashers Vaughn and Wilson are the same duo that entertained us years ago, delivering their lines in the same manner as they did back then. Vaughn delivers his lines at a rapid pace in a jumbled, hyper mess that has random words flying through the air. Wilson joins him in the stamped of words, but then brought sarcasm to the table to retaliate some of the quips thrown at him. Not one to be backed down, Vaughn would come right back with his spin on sarcastic dialog and usually throw in his natural, goofy face that brought the finishing punch to the humor. However, this is what these guys almost always do in their comedies, which means that if you are tired of this chemistry then you probably don't want to see this movie, because you might get annoyed with the brotherhood these two share. Yet there are other props due to some of the other cast members. The lovely Rose Byrne is a combination of beauty and good acting as she adds an Australian accent into mix and plays more of the love story part, yet her character is a step down from her previous parts. Josh Brener, the phone commercial guy, had a fun character as well, being the classic and hopeful nerd with a goal that seems impossible. As for the "bad" guy of this movie, Max Minghella did a nice job adding some British edge to the villain, but for the most part it was the same character with more bite and computer skills, than political bark. The rest of the group is fine, each doing a good job at the role they are playing and looking the part in every scene. \n\nThe Internship is a fun summer movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. While it is definitely not the most original movie, there are plenty of jokes to keep you laughing and having fun, no matter what generation you are from. However, there are a lot of similarities, primarily the acting, that this movie has and I will say is a somewhat knock off of Wedding Crashers. If you are looking for a fun group movie or just some mindless fun, well consider this film; otherwise wait for Redbox for this film.

He's dependable as always. Paul Giamatti, as Santa, is lovable. Kevin Spacey plays the conniving-turned-likable character with ease. Miranda Richardson is first-rate.

Maybe it's not the type of comedy it would leave me on my back laughing but again the did something good adding the bullying thingy to the plot so it would make it more attractive.\n\nThe screenplay was thorough,, the script was "in my opinion" well written, Steve Conrad took this project all by himself and he made it look really genuine ,, yes this is no where near his previous movies like "the weather man", "the promotion" or god knows "The Pursuit of Happiness" but it still felt so nice to watch.\n\nAs for the cast, Vince Vaughn is genius we all know that, Bravo,, but Dave Franco .. come on.. his performance here is applaudable .. he is really heading to be a really renowned actor ... There were more than a handful of really funny hardly laughable scenes for him,, When they're all in the spa and he start saying "boobies ... boobies" and there was another one when they were in the bathroom in the gay bar when he fell down and said "the penis touched my face" and then the slapping with the Japanese guys.. gosh his face expression is priceless :D Tom Wilkinson was fine same goes for most of the characters.\n\nAgain the comedy was just okay at the beginning but it really peaked to an exciting level in the hardcore party they were having :D\n\nOverall, i believe any movie has a purpose deserve a chance on the big screen and bullying is a huge matter and it was nice they shone a bit of light on it ,, and the comedy was fresh .. not a Wowzer but still nice and fresh so i found it enjoyable.

This time I'm coming at you with the Internship, the latest comedy starring that dynamic duo Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, who entertained us with Wedding Crashers. Well it seems eight years later the team who helped make that fun comedy have returned to make what many are calling a remake/ knock off of the "romantic" comedy. Is it true, or is there more to this movie than meets the eye? Please read on to hear my opinions. \n\nI'll agree that there are many similarities to the plot of Wedding Crashers. The two smooth talkers seem to be living the dream, until something happens to derail their train and send them on a new path that is for the better. Instead of banging babes and finding true love though, this time it's more about taking a chance and bridging a gap between generations all the while addressing the trials within. This is where one of my strengths of this movie comes in, the relevance of the plot to me. The Internship addresses big problems that faces many today, the security and safety of a job and the challenge that our culture has become. Being a student currently going through similar trials, I found the production team did a good job showing the various struggles that the younger generation faces, and their accompanying Impressing parents, cynical approaches to problems, the substitution of technology for life, and many more issues are all well integrated into this movie to drive the point across. Lucky for the audience it's not done in too cheesy a manner that it makes you think it's an 80's/90's sitcom. Something else I liked was the fact that all of the characters in their intern group had a problem, which allowed for yes you guessed it BALANCE, which we all know I like. Of course it's not just solely a bunch of smart college kids pulling miracles out of the air, and complaining about their problems. No Vaughn and Wilson's characters have their own problems that they had to face as they get integrated into a new world that the younger generation seems to run. Now we've seen these problems before I won't lie, but there is some fresh chemistry between the older generation and newer generation that shows off a dual teacher-student relationship. \n\nWith limited space let's move on to the comedy. The Internship switches gears from odd/awkward sex scenarios that floods the dialog and bounces into the land of stereotypical nerds, generation gaps, and new experiences that go a different route. For me this allowed for some balance in humor, with many of the "inspirational" speeches and geek events making me laugh at points through the movie. Character references from star wars, insults using computer vernacular, and dressing up as literature with some pizazz await those who go to this movie, so be ready for this humor. I like the diversity, and some of the creativity these guys did, but from the responses of the other audience members that wasn't the same case. Don't worry though they still laughed, but more so on the sexual situations that still appear a good number of times. As for the older generation, the team also digs up some references from the previous decades, which although were sometimes over my head, still entertained the audience and me at points. However, this could have been due to the delivery of the lines and acting that went with it.\n\nThis brings me to my next point, the acting. Like Wedding Crashers Vaughn and Wilson are the same duo that entertained us years ago, delivering their lines in the same manner as they did back then. Vaughn delivers his lines at a rapid pace in a jumbled, hyper mess that has random words flying through the air. Wilson joins him in the stamped of words, but then brought sarcasm to the table to retaliate some of the quips thrown at him. Not one to be backed down, Vaughn would come right back with his spin on sarcastic dialog and usually throw in his natural, goofy face that brought the finishing punch to the humor. However, this is what these guys almost always do in their comedies, which means that if you are tired of this chemistry then you probably don't want to see this movie, because you might get annoyed with the brotherhood these two share. Yet there are other props due to some of the other cast members. The lovely Rose Byrne is a combination of beauty and good acting as she adds an Australian accent into mix and plays more of the love story part, yet her character is a step down from her previous parts. Josh Brener, the phone commercial guy, had a fun character as well, being the classic and hopeful nerd with a goal that seems impossible. As for the "bad" guy of this movie, Max Minghella did a nice job adding some British edge to the villain, but for the most part it was the same character with more bite and computer skills, than political bark. The rest of the group is fine, each doing a good job at the role they are playing and looking the part in every scene. \n\nThe Internship is a fun summer movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. While it is definitely not the most original movie, there are plenty of jokes to keep you laughing and having fun, no matter what generation you are from. However, there are a lot of similarities, primarily the acting, that this movie has and I will say is a somewhat knock off of Wedding Crashers. If you are looking for a fun group movie or just some mindless fun, well consider this film; otherwise wait for Redbox for this film.

I read very good reviews of it and was interested to see it. Even if did not turn out to be what the reviews say (that happens quite often) I would had been fine.\n\nThe story is shown through the eyes of 11 year old boy Tommi (Alessandro Morace), who stays in an urban lower middle class dis-jointed family with his unemployed cameraman father Renato (Kim Rossi Stuart) and sister Viola (Marta Nobili). His mother Stefania (Barbora Bobulova) has left the family for some other man. Even in the dis-functional family where it is difficult to meet expenses and ends, Renato with all his frustrations, still loves the kids a lot. Parallel to this are two sub-plot running  one, where Renato wants his son Tommi to be a swimmer, whereas Tommi wants to become a football player. Second, the school life of Tommi  where he tries to seek friendship and love with his classmates. When Stefania suddenly appears one day out of no where back to the family  after a bit of test and trials  there is hope, happiness in the family. But again suddenly she disappears and leaves behind the traumatic family in despair.\n\nThis is the first time directorial debut of the very good looking famous Italian actor Kim Rossi Stuart. After his long acting career he does great justice to his new role as a Director. I read that he was not suppose to act in this movie, and only direct the movie; but just 15 days before the shooting  when the selected actor left the movie, the producers persuaded Kim to take the role of the father. Kim looks stunning, very pleasing to the eyes and has acted efficiently well. I think after a long time, I personally have seen some real good looks on screen. But I will leave it on girls and women to add more.\n\nBut the movie belongs wholly and solely to Alessandro Morace. First movie and he lives the role of Tommi as no other kid could have ever done justly. He shows all the range of emotions so naturally as if this role was written keeping him in mind. He is magnificent. Equally good in their small roles are Marta Nobili and Barbora Babulova.\n\nIn the beginning 15 minutes of the movie Director / actor Kim sets the tone by exposing to audience scenes that would make the point  of what to expect from the movie so people are not deceived into any flamboyant commercial stuff.\n\nThis movie is jointly written by four writers with Kim being one of them.

I read very good reviews of it and was interested to see it. Even if did not turn out to be what the reviews say (that happens quite often) I would had been fine.\n\nThe story is shown through the eyes of 11 year old boy Tommi (Alessandro Morace), who stays in an urban lower middle class dis-jointed family with his unemployed cameraman father Renato (Kim Rossi Stuart) and sister Viola (Marta Nobili). His mother Stefania (Barbora Bobulova) has left the family for some other man. Even in the dis-functional family where it is difficult to meet expenses and ends, Renato with all his frustrations, still loves the kids a lot. Parallel to this are two sub-plot running  one, where Renato wants his son Tommi to be a swimmer, whereas Tommi wants to become a football player. Second, the school life of Tommi  where he tries to seek friendship and love with his classmates. When Stefania suddenly appears one day out of no where back to the family  after a bit of test and trials  there is hope, happiness in the family. But again suddenly she disappears and leaves behind the traumatic family in despair.\n\nThis is the first time directorial debut of the very good looking famous Italian actor Kim Rossi Stuart. After his long acting career he does great justice to his new role as a Director. I read that he was not suppose to act in this movie, and only direct the movie; but just 15 days before the shooting  when the selected actor left the movie, the producers persuaded Kim to take the role of the father. Kim looks stunning, very pleasing to the eyes and has acted efficiently well. I think after a long time, I personally have seen some real good looks on screen. But I will leave it on girls and women to add more.\n\nBut the movie belongs wholly and solely to Alessandro Morace. First movie and he lives the role of Tommi as no other kid could have ever done justly. He shows all the range of emotions so naturally as if this role was written keeping him in mind. He is magnificent. Equally good in their small roles are Marta Nobili and Barbora Babulova.\n\nIn the beginning 15 minutes of the movie Director / actor Kim sets the tone by exposing to audience scenes that would make the point  of what to expect from the movie so people are not deceived into any flamboyant commercial stuff.\n\nThis movie is jointly written by four writers with Kim being one of them. There are so many numerous scenes in the movie that make you feel  oh alas, I hope I was part of this family and character. They are so wonderfully filmed. The touching moments moist your eyes and linger with you even after the movie is over.\n\nGood music, good editing, good cinematography! Great cinema! Well done. If I had not gone to see this  I would had missed a gem.\n\n(Stars 7.75 out of 10)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2596,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-05-05","keywords":"angry,friendship,bathtub,boy rear nudity,bad temper","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3529751833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzMxODQxZmQtYTNlOC00MmE0LTk4YTItNTU4MGQwYjQ3NDAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzMxODQxZmQtYTNlOC00MmE0LTk4YTItNTU4MGQwYjQ3NDAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2291703/","name":"Alessandro Morace","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744107/","name":"Kim Rossi Stuart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0090469/","name":"Barbora Bobulova"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744107/","name":"Kim Rossi Stuart"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108293/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066197/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274769/","name":"Linda Ferri","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2289556/","name":"Francesco Giammusso","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823425/","name":"Federico Starnone"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But than comes the last twist the last joke not to forget the beginning.\n\nSo go to the video store and enjoy!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1461,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1998-04-22","keywords":"police,unintentional kill,accidental death,death,murder","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488477/","name":"Michèle Laroque","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0243355/","name":"Albert Dupontel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0862854/","name":"Elise Tielrooy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404485/","name":"James Huth"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043215/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0078019/","name":"Romain Berthomieu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404485/","name":"James Huth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415038/","name":"Hugo Jacomet"],"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

We have disturbing fetish pictures about bugs, we have golden clockwork machines, we have a slow descent into madness, we have masterful use of dark and shadow to create a closed, claustrophobic atmosphere and we have that distinct Latin American lean.\n\nSo what's the story? An old antique dealer, Jesús Gris (Federico Luppi), has found an ancient alchemical device that promises to give life eternal to anyone that uses its power and provides the proper sacrifices. Unfortunately other parties are also looking for the device and thus Gris has to deal with the side effects of his newly found immortality as well as trying to keep himself and his relatives safe.\n\nClassic imagery, but del Toro's take on these old myths and ideas is refreshing and done well. You can see that the limitations of the budget are keeping him from telling the story he wants to tell, but as a whole it's not a bad tale. The various actors are also talented and really help to sell the mood to you. Luppi and Ron Perlman are the two shining stars and they'd later on go to star in many other films directed by del Toro.\n\nCronos is not the best horror movie I've seen, but if you've liked del Toro's later movies, it can be a rewarding experience to check out the very first one.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29175,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"1993-12-03","keywords":"eternal life,mexican horror,immortality,psychotronic film,fire in an oil drum","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"How 'Pan's Labyrinth' Inspired 'Scary Stories'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi105233433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGI1NTFiYzgtOGY2My00Mjc4LWEzM2MtMmFiMzAyNjc0ZGUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGI1NTFiYzgtOGY2My00Mjc4LWEzM2MtMmFiMzAyNjc0ZGUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer/producer Guillermo del Toro and director André Øvredal sit down with IMDb to discuss their new film, 'Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527002/","name":"Federico Luppi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111610/","name":"Claudio Brook"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029604/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019307/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038628/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's the cinematic ideal, the standard by which subsequent films are judged, at least in terms of acting and dialogue. Maybe the camera, which does nothing but sit there as the actors act, could have been made a little less static. But the story screams stage play, which implies lots of talk and not much "action". The film doesn't pretend to do all things. But what it does do, it does extremely well.\n\nAs Margo, Bette Davis gives what I would consider one of the best performances, if not the best performance, in any film I have ever seen. She truly becomes Margo, that "fixture of the theater", so beloved yet so insecure. And as Eve, "the mousy one, with the trench coat and the funny hat", breathy Anne Baxter proves adept at subtleties that allow her character to change gradually over time.\n\nThen there's George Sanders who effortlessly slips into the role of witty, urbane, pompous Addison DeWitt, columnist magnifico, a man whose high opinion of himself allows him to declare to us, as viewers, that he is "essential to the theater". Celeste Holm and reliable Thelma Ritter give topnotch performances as well.\n\nAnd the Mankiewicz script, which tells the story of a group of theater people, is heavy on dialogue, but it's totally believable, as characters talk shop and interrelate, by means of suitable verbal conflict and subtle subtext. Even more than that, the dialogue is witty and clever, with tons of theatrical metaphors, like when Bill (Gary Merrill) angrily tells Margo: "And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me, it spells a paranoid insecurity that you should be ashamed of." To which Margo just as angrily spits out: "Cut, print it, what happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pits?"\n\nOne of my favorite scenes has several people sitting on a stairway at a party. A curvaceous but bird-brained Miss Casswell (Marilyn Monroe), "from the Copacabana school of acting", desires another drink. "Oh waiter!", she yells out. Addison schools her: "That isn't a waiter, my dear; that's a butler." To which she fires back: "Well I can't yell 'Oh butler', can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler". Addison then concedes: "You have a point, an idiotic one, but a point."\n\nI'm not sure I really like the characters in this film. Generally, they're self-absorbed, vain, haughty, and backbiting. They're not all that likable. And that would be my only serious complaint.\n\nOtherwise, "All About Eve" is a film that excels at great language and great acting. If ever there was a film that deserves the status of "classic", this is surely it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":127527,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1950-10-27","keywords":"theater,meta film,based on short story,famous line,title spoken by character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"All About Eve","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2863989017","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2U4MzM3ODItN2EzMi00NTY5LTgyYWUtYWQyZmViNDI2Y2IyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2U4MzM3ODItN2EzMi00NTY5LTgyYWUtYWQyZmViNDI2Y2IyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000012/","name":"Bette Davis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000879/","name":"Anne Baxter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001695/","name":"George Sanders"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000581/","name":"Joseph L.

I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate.

I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that.

Four sleazy thugs, who could be spotted as bad guys by a blind man, hijack a Lexington Avenue subway and take passengers as hostages. A ransom-for-hostages negotiation begins via radio between the driver's compartment on the train and the central control center for the New York City subway system. The premise is hardly new territory, and, for those who have seen the Walter-Matthau-Robert-Shaw version of the John Godey novel, the film is even less original.\n\nHowever, for audiences that want a night out at the movies with a rousing action flick, "The Taking of Pelham 123" will fill the bill nicely. The editing is often frenetic, and the camera moves even during dialog-heavy scenes. The chases are fast paced, the car crashes are over the top, and the bloody scenes are properly bloody. While all of this is enough for some mindless entertainment, four excellent performances enhance the proceedings and make the film seem better than it is. John Travolta pulls out the stops as Ryder, the head hijacker, and, in his full wacko persona, steals his every scene. As the man on the other end of the phone, bespectacled Denzel Washington, dressed down in everyman frumpy, is quiet and assured, although nothing quite suggests that the character of Walter Garber will or could rise to his climactic actions. James Gandolfini plays the mayor with a sly sense of fun, and John Turturro is a hard-to-gauge hostage negotiator. "Pelham" is a man's movie, and the women are relegated to small, peripheral roles as wives, conductors, and hostages. How refreshing the film might have been if Scott had cast a female in one of the four main roles.\n\nHowever, whatever the movie's flaws, and there are many, "The Taking of Pelham 123" does what it sets out to do: entertain and engage the audience for two hours. Don't expect more, and you won't be disappointed, and, in a summer movie, "Pelham's" assets are exactly what most of us are looking for anyway.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":193092,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-06-10","keywords":"man wears eyeglasses,woman wears eyeglasses,train,hostage,subway","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Taking of Pelham 123: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1348535065","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTQ4Mjc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk4MTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTQ4Mjc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk4MTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed men hijack a New York City subway train, holding the passengers hostage in return for a ransom, and turning an ordinary day's work for dispatcher Walter Garbe (Washington) into a face-off with the mastermind behind the crime (Travolta)."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350079/","name":"Luis Guzmán"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0323945/","name":"John Godey"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's not very comfortable watching a film that shows sociopaths-- people born without the ability to feel guilt and empathise with others-- are born, not made and their dangerous traits are apparent even in childhood. 'The Good Son' revolves around Mark, a motherless boy of twelve who is sent to stay with his Uncle Wallace, Aunt Susan and two cousins, twelve-year-old Henry and six-year-old Connie. At first, Mark revels in the visit that takes his mind off his recent bereavement but he soon starts to realise that Henry is a sociopath whose parents are blind to his dark, violent side. It is a film that pulls no punches in just how malevolent Henry is and how easily he will pick off anyone who dares to interfere with his twisted sense of fun.\n\nMacaulay Culkin was excellent as the angelic-looking Henry whose boyish cuteness hide his true nature and his performance here proves he could have been one of the few child actors who graduated into a successful young adult actor had his personal life not been such a mess. It really was chilling seeing the child I was so used to seeing in comedies being so emotionally cold. But it is Elijah Wood's Mark who gives the film heart. Young Wood, only eleven years old when he filmed this, delivered a great performance as a young boy faced with the awful truth and desperate to stop Henry while juggling his grief over losing his mother. The scene where Mark is convinced Henry has poisoned the food is a perfect example of how Wood portrayed Mark's desperation, hysteria and helplessness in the face of his cousin's evil.\n\nHowever, one of the flaws of the film is that is a bit choppy, jumping from scene-to-scene without giving you a feel for the other characters, which is a shame because this is one film where you do need to have an understanding of just how Henry's nature affects all those around him and how he gets away with it all. I read the novelisation of the film by Todd Strasser before seeing the film so it's all the more noticeable for me. The book not only gives greater insight into Mark's budding fraternal friendship with Connie and his need to seek a mother in Susan but it also shows Susan's growing awareness to the monster Henry is and how she feels when she is made to choose between Mark and her murderous child.\n\nOverall, this film is enjoyable enough for a psychological thriller (although a few TV detective shows have done this idea in a slicker way) and it is nice to see a film that doesn't take a softly-softly attitude when dealing with the matter of children who kill. However, the ending was a bit of a cop-out as there could have been so many other avenues to explore had things ended differently for Henry (what should be done with sociopathic children? How do decent, loving families deal with such a child?). Those who do expect a bit more from their films will probably be disappointed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40078,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1993-09-24","keywords":"killer child,evil child,child villain,manipulation,killing a dog","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1163705113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E3MGY5MTktZWMxZC00NzY3LTgxMjYtZDkzMmRkNWUwMWFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXJoYW5uYWg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E3MGY5MTktZWMxZC00NzY3LTgxMjYtZDkzMmRkNWUwMWFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXJoYW5uYWg@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000346/","name":"Macaulay Culkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0187724/","name":"Wendy Crewson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0747849/","name":"Joseph Ruben"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568605/","name":"Ian McEwan"}],"duration":"PT1H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Four sleazy thugs, who could be spotted as bad guys by a blind man, hijack a Lexington Avenue subway and take passengers as hostages. A ransom-for-hostages negotiation begins via radio between the driver's compartment on the train and the central control center for the New York City subway system. The premise is hardly new territory, and, for those who have seen the Walter-Matthau-Robert-Shaw version of the John Godey novel, the film is even less original.\n\nHowever, for audiences that want a night out at the movies with a rousing action flick, "The Taking of Pelham 123" will fill the bill nicely. The editing is often frenetic, and the camera moves even during dialog-heavy scenes. The chases are fast paced, the car crashes are over the top, and the bloody scenes are properly bloody.

Four sleazy thugs, who could be spotted as bad guys by a blind man, hijack a Lexington Avenue subway and take passengers as hostages. A ransom-for-hostages negotiation begins via radio between the driver's compartment on the train and the central control center for the New York City subway system. The premise is hardly new territory, and, for those who have seen the Walter-Matthau-Robert-Shaw version of the John Godey novel, the film is even less original.\n\nHowever, for audiences that want a night out at the movies with a rousing action flick, "The Taking of Pelham 123" will fill the bill nicely. The editing is often frenetic, and the camera moves even during dialog-heavy scenes. The chases are fast paced, the car crashes are over the top, and the bloody scenes are properly bloody. While all of this is enough for some mindless entertainment, four excellent performances enhance the proceedings and make the film seem better than it is. John Travolta pulls out the stops as Ryder, the head hijacker, and, in his full wacko persona, steals his every scene. As the man on the other end of the phone, bespectacled Denzel Washington, dressed down in everyman frumpy, is quiet and assured, although nothing quite suggests that the character of Walter Garber will or could rise to his climactic actions.

Though it may annoy some people, I felt the new take turns Vantage Point into a taut terrorist thriller.\n\nThe new take or approach is jumping right into the moment (everything is already planned out, people and weapons in place, etc.) of the action and then telling it from eight different points of view. This is where some people may be mildly irritated because after you see one point of view everything is suddenly rewound and shown from the next person's point of view (this is done six times) before they all converge into a thrilling finale filled with one massive adrenaline-fuelled car/chase sequence.\n\nBecause of the complex twists and turns of the plot and characters I will be brief, very brief actually, on the plot.

At the beginning of this meeting the US president is assassinated as he takes the stage, and it begins replaying the assassination through all the different points of view. The editing must be commended in this film as it blends all the points of views so sophisticatedly you cannot help being engrossed, and the star-studded cast includes Dennis Quaid, Mathew Fox, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver simply adds to everything.\n\nIn the theater I was watching some people called out their annoyance of "again?!" on the fifth rewind, which I find amusing as the filmmakers are simply trying to come up with something new in these sequel-ridden times. And probably as those same people say Hollywood is "out of ideas" they get angry when it tries something "different" and would rather go spend their money on Spider-man 8.\n\nI felt Vantage Point was an intelligent thriller, and yes it had its' share of implausible plot points, but these were minor as the new technique makes you feel like you have an all-seeing surveillance system.

    <desc lang="hr">Džejk Peralt, nezreli, ali talentovani detektiv iz Bruklina, dolazi u neposredni sukob sa svojim novim zapovednikom, ozbiljnim i strogim kapetanom Rejom Holtom.

"The Good Doctor" je američka, medicinska, dramska serija u kojoj je glavni lik neobični, mladi hirurg Šon Marfi, autistični genije koji sve posmatra drugačije od ostalih i koji se iz rodnog Vajominga seli u San Hoze kako bi se zaposlio u prestižnoj bolnici Svetog Bonaventure. Uprkos tome što nema socijalne veštine i ne snalazi se u međuljudskim odnosima i nepoznati su mu pojmovi poput sreće i ljubavi, on je neverovatan stručnjak. Doktor Šon je izuzetno drag i inteligentan, ali ga šef ipak uzima na zub, zbog njegovog direktnosti i nespretnog ponašanja prema pacijentima, međutim, njegova genijlanost je neosporna.</desc>

Part 2 was also an edge-of-seater.  But by the time you reach this, Part 5, the tension has gone from the series and Michael Myers has descended from a believable shadow-stalking figure into an unkillable Jason 'Friday the 13th' Voorhees clone.\n\nFor what its worth, the plot of this film involves Myers coming after Jamie, who is now in a childrens' psychiatric hospital after attacking her stepmother.  The concept of Jamie having a psychic bond with her deranged uncle is interesting, but it's all completely ruined by the constant unfunny attempts at humour, the tedious padding and the lack of likeable would-be victims.  Instead of genuine characters all we have here are Porky-style sex-mad teenagers with nothing approaching an IQ between them.  There's even a scene set in a barn similar to the one in some of the Friday the 13th films.

Part 2 was also an edge-of-seater.  But by the time you reach this, Part 5, the tension has gone from the series and Michael Myers has descended from a believable shadow-stalking figure into an unkillable Jason 'Friday the 13th' Voorhees clone.\n\nFor what its worth, the plot of this film involves Myers coming after Jamie, who is now in a childrens' psychiatric hospital after attacking her stepmother.  The concept of Jamie having a psychic bond with her deranged uncle is interesting, but it's all completely ruined by the constant unfunny attempts at humour, the tedious padding and the lack of likeable would-be victims.  Instead of genuine characters all we have here are Porky-style sex-mad teenagers with nothing approaching an IQ between them.  There's even a scene set in a barn similar to the one in some of the Friday the 13th films.  And Rachel from Part 4 seems to have been reduced to a stereotype blonde airhead whose only purpose in the film is to run around half-naked before being slaughtered. And why does Myers' mask look nothing like the one he wore in the previous films? \n\nOne good point in this film is Donald Pleasence, who is at his best as an overwhelming Dr Loomis who dominates his every scene and makes the film worth viewing.  There is also an enigmatic Man in the Black Fedora-type figure who leads the film into the far superior Part 6.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1989-10-13","keywords":"halloween,fifth part,massacre,slasher,psychopath","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer, 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2057026073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTkyZjk1MWItZGYzOC00YjhjLTg4MzctZTkzNjAxMWNlZTEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTkyZjk1MWItZGYzOC00YjhjLTg4MzctZTkzNjAxMWNlZTEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official trailer for 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000587/","name":"Donald Pleasence","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0364583/","name":"Danielle Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0332081/","name":"Ellie Cornell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652860/","name":"Dominique Othenin-Girard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004014/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0352271/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0756490/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000118/","name":"John Carpenter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384185/","name":"Debra Hill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4302073/","name":"Michael Jacobs"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Part 2 was also an edge-of-seater.  But by the time you reach this, Part 5, the tension has gone from the series and Michael Myers has descended from a believable shadow-stalking figure into an unkillable Jason 'Friday the 13th' Voorhees clone.\n\nFor what its worth, the plot of this film involves Myers coming after Jamie, who is now in a childrens' psychiatric hospital after attacking her stepmother.  The concept of Jamie having a psychic bond with her deranged uncle is interesting, but it's all completely ruined by the constant unfunny attempts at humour, the tedious padding and the lack of likeable would-be victims.  Instead of genuine characters all we have here are Porky-style sex-mad teenagers with nothing approaching an IQ between them.  There's even a scene set in a barn similar to the one in some of the Friday the 13th films.  And Rachel from Part 4 seems to have been reduced to a stereotype blonde airhead whose only purpose in the film is to run around half-naked before being slaughtered. And why does Myers' mask look nothing like the one he wore in the previous films? \n\nOne good point in this film is Donald Pleasence, who is at his best as an overwhelming Dr Loomis who dominates his every scene and makes the film worth viewing.  There is also an enigmatic Man in the Black Fedora-type figure who leads the film into the far superior Part 6."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1989-10-13","keywords":"halloween,fifth part,massacre,slasher,psychopath","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer, 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2057026073","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTkyZjk1MWItZGYzOC00YjhjLTg4MzctZTkzNjAxMWNlZTEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTkyZjk1MWItZGYzOC00YjhjLTg4MzctZTkzNjAxMWNlZTEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official trailer for 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000587/","name":"Donald Pleasence"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0364583/","name":"Danielle Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0332081/","name":"Ellie Cornell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652860/","name":"Dominique Othenin-Girard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004014/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0352271/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0756490/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000118/","name":"John Carpenter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384185/","name":"Debra Hill"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4302073/","name":"Michael Jacobs"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Part 2 was also an edge-of-seater.  But by the time you reach this, Part 5, the tension has gone from the series and Michael Myers has descended from a believable shadow-stalking figure into an unkillable Jason 'Friday the 13th' Voorhees clone.\n\nFor what its worth, the plot of this film involves Myers coming after Jamie, who is now in a childrens' psychiatric hospital after attacking her stepmother.  The concept of Jamie having a psychic bond with her deranged uncle is interesting, but it's all completely ruined by the constant unfunny attempts at humour, the tedious padding and the lack of likeable would-be victims.  Instead of genuine characters all we have here are Porky-style sex-mad teenagers with nothing approaching an IQ between them.  There's even a scene set in a barn similar to the one in some of the Friday the 13th films.  And Rachel from Part 4 seems to have been reduced to a stereotype blonde airhead whose only purpose in the film is to run around half-naked before being slaughtered. And why does Myers' mask look nothing like the one he wore in the previous films? \n\nOne good point in this film is Donald Pleasence, who is at his best as an overwhelming Dr Loomis who dominates his every scene and makes the film worth viewing.  There is also an enigmatic Man in the Black Fedora-type figure who leads the film into the far superior Part 6.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1989-10-13","keywords":"halloween,fifth part,massacre,slasher,psychopath","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer, 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2057026073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTkyZjk1MWItZGYzOC00YjhjLTg4MzctZTkzNjAxMWNlZTEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTkyZjk1MWItZGYzOC00YjhjLTg4MzctZTkzNjAxMWNlZTEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official trailer for 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000587/","name":"Donald Pleasence","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0364583/","name":"Danielle Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0332081/","name":"Ellie Cornell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652860/","name":"Dominique Othenin-Girard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004014/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0352271/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0756490/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000118/","name":"John Carpenter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384185/","name":"Debra Hill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4302073/","name":"Michael Jacobs"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In the end I found it a little insulting to the 'Wrong Turn' franchise.\n\nI give it 2/10 and I think that may be slightly generous.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Adventure","Horror"],"datePublished":"2009-10-08","keywords":"kissing breasts,breasts,three finger character,cleavage,scantily clad female","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wrong Turn 3: Left For Dead","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2286092825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGY4ZmJlN2MtYzQ3ZC00NTAzLWJmYzQtZmZlY2M3MzJkOTg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGY4ZmJlN2MtYzQ3ZC00NTAzLWJmYzQtZmZlY2M3MzJkOTg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Gory trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1755719/","name":"Tom Frederic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2857778/","name":"Janet Montgomery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2146097/","name":"Gil Kolirin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0639508/","name":"Declan O'Brien"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010224/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046206/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3569807/","name":"Connor James Delaney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568416/","name":"Alan B.

Kept in a nursing home, days filled with vapid activities like shuffleboard or mah-jongg, whiling away hours floating in a deserted swimming pool, watching people your own age drop like flies. When that changes through the magic of alien technology, they become, if not the picture of reckless youth, at least a semblance of the people they were once upon a time, proving the old cliché: you ARE only as old as you feel. In that, it's a good lesson for people heading into their golden years or even those of us just having midlife crises. We can't help but grow old. But it's up to us whether we want to BE old or merely mature.\n\nFor a science fiction movie, it would appear to have few special effects. This is an illusion. There are quite a few effects shots, although the variety of effects is rather limited. The glowing aliens are quite good except for the all too familiar hand movements by Caprice Rothe, who first did the job for "E.T." Still, by and large the effects are impressive and convincing even when compared against the latest films of the 21st century. Even more impressive was the poolhouse, which was hastily constructed purely as a setpiece for the movie. It looks absolutely real, as if it had sat there among the Florida palms for decades.\n\nTahnee Welch, daughter of the seemingly ageless Raquel, was wholesomely fetching here. Whether she was a limited actress or merely underplaying the role is for others to decide. Ron Howard wisely kept Steve Guttenberg's role limited, focusing mainly on the older characters. A little Guttenberg goofiness goes a long way. Also present are the standard Howard family repertory, with brother Clint as the nursing home attendant and father Rance making a brief appearance as a detective. Much as already been said about the excellent performances of the older cast members. This was, after all, the role that finally won an Oscar for Don Ameche. But they're slowly slipping away from us, one by one. First Jack Gilford, then Ameche, then Jessica Tandy and recently Gwen Verdon. At least we'll have this movie to remember them by. Maybe they weren't at the peaks of their careers, but quite possibly the roles they fit most comfortably.\n\nTwo attempts to cash in on this movie failed. Both 1987's "*batteries Not Included," starring Tandy and Cronyn, and the 1988 sequel "Cocoon: The Return" flopped. Neither had the genuine warmth of this original. Ron Howard showed good judgement in turning down the chance to direct the sequel.\n\nAs for the musical score, it's one of James Horner's better works, mixing symphonic grandeur with childlike wonderment. Alas, he does fall into old habits and reuse some bars and measures from his "Wolfen" and "Star Trek II" scores.\n\nIt's a shame this movie never found the audience it deserved. I first saw this in a shopping mall four-plex a couple of weeks after its release. There couldn't have been more than 20 people in the entire theater. The whole movie holds up remarkably well in the 16 years since, except for the break dancing. My god, has it been 16 years already?

When that changes through the magic of alien technology, they become, if not the picture of reckless youth, at least a semblance of the people they were once upon a time, proving the old cliché: you ARE only as old as you feel. In that, it's a good lesson for people heading into their golden years or even those of us just having midlife crises. We can't help but grow old. But it's up to us whether we want to BE old or merely mature.\n\nFor a science fiction movie, it would appear to have few special effects. This is an illusion. There are quite a few effects shots, although the variety of effects is rather limited. The glowing aliens are quite good except for the all too familiar hand movements by Caprice Rothe, who first did the job for "E.T." Still, by and large the effects are impressive and convincing even when compared against the latest films of the 21st century. Even more impressive was the poolhouse, which was hastily constructed purely as a setpiece for the movie. It looks absolutely real, as if it had sat there among the Florida palms for decades.\n\nTahnee Welch, daughter of the seemingly ageless Raquel, was wholesomely fetching here. Whether she was a limited actress or merely underplaying the role is for others to decide. Ron Howard wisely kept Steve Guttenberg's role limited, focusing mainly on the older characters. A little Guttenberg goofiness goes a long way. Also present are the standard Howard family repertory, with brother Clint as the nursing home attendant and father Rance making a brief appearance as a detective. Much as already been said about the excellent performances of the older cast members. This was, after all, the role that finally won an Oscar for Don Ameche. But they're slowly slipping away from us, one by one. First Jack Gilford, then Ameche, then Jessica Tandy and recently Gwen Verdon. At least we'll have this movie to remember them by. Maybe they weren't at the peaks of their careers, but quite possibly the roles they fit most comfortably.\n\nTwo attempts to cash in on this movie failed. Both 1987's "*batteries Not Included," starring Tandy and Cronyn, and the 1988 sequel "Cocoon: The Return" flopped. Neither had the genuine warmth of this original. Ron Howard showed good judgement in turning down the chance to direct the sequel.\n\nAs for the musical score, it's one of James Horner's better works, mixing symphonic grandeur with childlike wonderment. Alas, he does fall into old habits and reuse some bars and measures from his "Wolfen" and "Star Trek II" scores.\n\nIt's a shame this movie never found the audience it deserved. I first saw this in a shopping mall four-plex a couple of weeks after its release. There couldn't have been more than 20 people in the entire theater. The whole movie holds up remarkably well in the 16 years since, except for the break dancing. My god, has it been 16 years already? Where can I find some Antarean life force?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":61144,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1985-06-21","keywords":"alien,swimming pool,bare chested male,peephole,shapeshifter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2708061721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2EzOGMxOTEtNzNiNi00OWJkLWE4NTAtMzMyODk2MzBjMzJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2EzOGMxOTEtNzNiNi00OWJkLWE4NTAtMzMyODk2MzBjMzJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000747/","name":"Don Ameche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000979/","name":"Wilford Brimley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002025/","name":"Hume Cronyn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000165/","name":"Ron Howard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019166/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142386/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0070676/","name":"Tom Benedek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0764545/","name":"David Saperstein"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The Running Man has a premise that was later used by Battle Royale and The Hunger Games and easily stands along other dystopias from films of the era like Escape From New York and Robocop. It was violent, cheesy and had lots of Arnie one-liners. The Running Man was meant to be a satire about game shows but it's satire is more prescient now with the world of reality TV, 24 hour TV, and deep fakes.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":148438,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1987-12-25","keywords":"game of death,oppression,chainsaw,explosive collar,film starts with text","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Running Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2549285145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODEwNGNjNTYtNTJjNC00N2M0LWI2MjItYTkzMTFiOTk2Y2ZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODEwNGNjNTYtNTJjNC00N2M0LWI2MjItYTkzMTFiOTk2Y2ZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000744/","name":"Maria Conchita Alonso","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001433/","name":"Yaphet Kotto"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001274/","name":"Paul Michael Glaser"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047779/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009677/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000175/","name":"Stephen King","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211823/","name":"Steven E. de Souza"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Okrutna kraljica Gedren otme Talisman, tajanstveni predmet kojim je stvoren čitav svemir, kako bi zavladala svetom. Pri tome ubije i sve čuvarke Talismana, osim Varne, koja, iako teško ranjena, jedina uspe pobeći. Varnu od Gedreninih vojnika spasi ratnik Kalidor, i Varna od njega zatraži da potraži njenu sestru Sonju. Kalidor pronađe Sonju i odvede joj sestru, koja od nje na samrti zatraži da uništi Talisman i spreči Gedren u njenin planovima. Sonja obeća i kreće u osvetnički pohod, jer i sama ima ličnih razloga za obračun sa Gedren. Kalidor se pridružuje Sonji u pohodu, a putem im se priključuju i mladi princ Tarn, i njegov čuvar Falkon.</desc>

A worthy movie made for the fans and everyone else.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":463386,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2008-06-18","keywords":"marvel cinematic universe,based on comic,bruce banner character,the incredible hulk character,reboot of series","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Incredible Hulk: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1726152985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second trailer for The Incredible Hulk, directed by Louis Leterrier.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000239/","name":"Liv Tyler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504642/","name":"Louis Leterrier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672015/","name":"Zak Penn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456158/","name":"Jack Kirby"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is a direct continuation of that story.\n\nThe good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.\n\nDirector/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) "in the role" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.\n\nAfter the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the "inside" was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.\n\nDuring the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.\n\nCoppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended "flashback" segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.\n\nBut let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.\n\nThere's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call "J.K. Rowling Syndrome". That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.\n\nThe film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.\n\nI've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.\n\nThe second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.\n\nAlthough the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1199431,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1974-12-18","keywords":"revenge,1950s,corrupt politician,cuban revolution,lake tahoe nevada","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Godfather: Part II","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi696162841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4YzY4OGMtZDM5YS00YWVkLTgwMDktNzVmOGU3NjEwMjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWE4YzY4OGMtZDM5YS00YWVkLTgwMDktNzVmOGU3NjEwMjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Godfather: Part II"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000380/","name":"Robert Duvall"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099634/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020958/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701374/","name":"Mario Puzo"}],"duration":"PT3H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is a direct continuation of that story.\n\nThe good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.\n\nDirector/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) "in the role" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.\n\nAfter the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the "inside" was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.\n\nDuring the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.\n\nCoppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended "flashback" segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.\n\nBut let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl.

However, a monkey has become a carrier for the virus and has reached the US. When Jimbo Scott smuggles the monkey out to sell to a pet store, he is infected and spreads it to others. Eventually the local town of Cedar Creek becomes overrun and the US form a barricade around the town. With the politicians planning the destruction of the town to stop the virus spreading, Col Sam Daniels and his team race to find some other way of stopping it.\n\nWhether you viewed in back in 1995 or now, where the threat of viral attack doesn't seem so unlikely, this film should be gripping on the basis of the material. At points it does have good moments but generally this generally suffers from trying to do too much and having a script that cannot control its subject. For most of the film the virus is almost a concept rather than a real threat and it talks a lot without really delivering. Even when an entire town is quarantined and dying, it all remains very calm where really it needed fear and panic to seep into every character and every scene. Sadly it doesn't do this and the film bogs itself down in personal infections, squabbling ex-partners and so on  did we need the main characters to get the virus? Wasn't it enough for an entire town to be dying and for the world to be at risk? Anyway, at the midpoint the film suddenly becomes an action movie with helicopter chases and a plot that can best be summed up as 'catch the monkey'.\n\nEven with this section, the flaws are rife  the action bits are OK but it seems unlikely that finding a monkey somewhere in the US would be a more complicated task! This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it just about manages to be enjoyable enough, but nowhere near the potential that this had. Part of the reason is a plot that struggles from logic gaps and a lack of intelligence and urgency. The lack of intelligence comes from the film completely ignoring the moral complexities that come with such a situation  the film ignores the fact that bad things may need to be done to stop the virus and instead just paints good guys (save the people) and bad guys (bomb the people). The lack of urgency comes from the failure to really make the virus a threat; really I needed Cedar Creek to become the US in miniature  having everyone calm didn't do it for me and I needed more than just two cars making a break for it. But then the writing generally isn't up to the task and the heavy dialogue is pretty average at best with clichéd lines and far too much 'personal' stuff between the main characters.\n\nEven the main 'bad' guy is a fudge as it just paints everything black and white.\n\nAnother reason that this doesn't live up to its potential is the sheer numbers of faces in the film. Hoffman makes a strange action star but he does OK with what little he is given. Russo is no good at all and happily has little to do but deliver the personal 'involvement' that the film cannot manage to deliver any other way. Gooding is pretty good in a semi-action role and Spacey has some good lines before he too becomes a cheap emotional device. Sutherland gives a by the numbers performance as he has nothing to really work with, but Freeman is more interesting because he does. It's just a shame that this talented cast were not used better in this film. An aside that was interesting to me was that Dale Dye has a minor role in the film while also serving as military adviser to the film. He is an interesting man because his career has grown from adviser to being a reasonable actor to becoming a writer, producer and (recently) a 2nd unit director  clearly a motivated and talented man who it would be interesting to listen to talk sometime.\n\nOverall the potential is there but it is unrealised. The cast are great on paper but have nothing to work with in a script that delivers average dialogue, no real characters, no moral ambiguities, no real involvement and no sense of scale or threat. It does have some pace at times and it has enough 'OK' moments to be worth watching maybe once but I was annoyed that the potential of the material alone was missed. I think the film can be summed up by the ending  one minute we have an exciting helicopter stand off and the next we have a pay-off that is so lazy and so simplistic that I was actually visibly annoyed by it. Passable entertainment if you are in an undemanding mood but it never even gets near the potential it had."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":126351,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1995-03-10","keywords":"virus,epidemic,monkey,disease,quarantine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Outbreak","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi547029273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFmOGU2ODYtOTQ4Ni00YjJlLTkxMTEtZWQwZGI3YTlhZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFmOGU2ODYtOTQ4Ni00YjJlLTkxMTEtZWQwZGI3YTlhZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000163/","name":"Dustin Hoffman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000623/","name":"Rene Russo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000583/","name":"Wolfgang Petersen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027715/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090684/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245435/","name":"Laurence Dworet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690798/","name":"Robert Roy Pool"}],"duration":"PT2H7M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, a monkey has become a carrier for the virus and has reached the US. When Jimbo Scott smuggles the monkey out to sell to a pet store, he is infected and spreads it to others. Eventually the local town of Cedar Creek becomes overrun and the US form a barricade around the town. With the politicians planning the destruction of the town to stop the virus spreading, Col Sam Daniels and his team race to find some other way of stopping it.\n\nWhether you viewed in back in 1995 or now, where the threat of viral attack doesn't seem so unlikely, this film should be gripping on the basis of the material. At points it does have good moments but generally this generally suffers from trying to do too much and having a script that cannot control its subject. For most of the film the virus is almost a concept rather than a real threat and it talks a lot without really delivering. Even when an entire town is quarantined and dying, it all remains very calm where really it needed fear and panic to seep into every character and every scene. Sadly it doesn't do this and the film bogs itself down in personal infections, squabbling ex-partners and so on  did we need the main characters to get the virus? Wasn't it enough for an entire town to be dying and for the world to be at risk? Anyway, at the midpoint the film suddenly becomes an action movie with helicopter chases and a plot that can best be summed up as 'catch the monkey'.\n\nEven with this section, the flaws are rife  the action bits are OK but it seems unlikely that finding a monkey somewhere in the US would be a more complicated task! This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it just about manages to be enjoyable enough, but nowhere near the potential that this had. Part of the reason is a plot that struggles from logic gaps and a lack of intelligence and urgency. The lack of intelligence comes from the film completely ignoring the moral complexities that come with such a situation  the film ignores the fact that bad things may need to be done to stop the virus and instead just paints good guys (save the people) and bad guys (bomb the people). The lack of urgency comes from the failure to really make the virus a threat; really I needed Cedar Creek to become the US in miniature  having everyone calm didn't do it for me and I needed more than just two cars making a break for it. But then the writing generally isn't up to the task and the heavy dialogue is pretty average at best with clichéd lines and far too much 'personal' stuff between the main characters.\n\nEven the main 'bad' guy is a fudge as it just paints everything black and white.\n\nAnother reason that this doesn't live up to its potential is the sheer numbers of faces in the film.

It's just a shame that this talented cast were not used better in this film. An aside that was interesting to me was that Dale Dye has a minor role in the film while also serving as military adviser to the film.

However, a monkey has become a carrier for the virus and has reached the US. When Jimbo Scott smuggles the monkey out to sell to a pet store, he is infected and spreads it to others. Eventually the local town of Cedar Creek becomes overrun and the US form a barricade around the town. With the politicians planning the destruction of the town to stop the virus spreading, Col Sam Daniels and his team race to find some other way of stopping it.\n\nWhether you viewed in back in 1995 or now, where the threat of viral attack doesn't seem so unlikely, this film should be gripping on the basis of the material. At points it does have good moments but generally this generally suffers from trying to do too much and having a script that cannot control its subject. For most of the film the virus is almost a concept rather than a real threat and it talks a lot without really delivering. Even when an entire town is quarantined and dying, it all remains very calm where really it needed fear and panic to seep into every character and every scene. Sadly it doesn't do this and the film bogs itself down in personal infections, squabbling ex-partners and so on  did we need the main characters to get the virus? Wasn't it enough for an entire town to be dying and for the world to be at risk? Anyway, at the midpoint the film suddenly becomes an action movie with helicopter chases and a plot that can best be summed up as 'catch the monkey'.\n\nEven with this section, the flaws are rife  the action bits are OK but it seems unlikely that finding a monkey somewhere in the US would be a more complicated task! This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it just about manages to be enjoyable enough, but nowhere near the potential that this had. Part of the reason is a plot that struggles from logic gaps and a lack of intelligence and urgency. The lack of intelligence comes from the film completely ignoring the moral complexities that come with such a situation  the film ignores the fact that bad things may need to be done to stop the virus and instead just paints good guys (save the people) and bad guys (bomb the people). The lack of urgency comes from the failure to really make the virus a threat; really I needed Cedar Creek to become the US in miniature  having everyone calm didn't do it for me and I needed more than just two cars making a break for it. But then the writing generally isn't up to the task and the heavy dialogue is pretty average at best with clichéd lines and far too much 'personal' stuff between the main characters.\n\nEven the main 'bad' guy is a fudge as it just paints everything black and white.\n\nAnother reason that this doesn't live up to its potential is the sheer numbers of faces in the film. Hoffman makes a strange action star but he does OK with what little he is given. Russo is no good at all and happily has little to do but deliver the personal 'involvement' that the film cannot manage to deliver any other way. Gooding is pretty good in a semi-action role and Spacey has some good lines before he too becomes a cheap emotional device. Sutherland gives a by the numbers performance as he has nothing to really work with, but Freeman is more interesting because he does. It's just a shame that this talented cast were not used better in this film. An aside that was interesting to me was that Dale Dye has a minor role in the film while also serving as military adviser to the film. He is an interesting man because his career has grown from adviser to being a reasonable actor to becoming a writer, producer and (recently) a 2nd unit director  clearly a motivated and talented man who it would be interesting to listen to talk sometime.\n\nOverall the potential is there but it is unrealised. The cast are great on paper but have nothing to work with in a script that delivers average dialogue, no real characters, no moral ambiguities, no real involvement and no sense of scale or threat. It does have some pace at times and it has enough 'OK' moments to be worth watching maybe once but I was annoyed that the potential of the material alone was missed. I think the film can be summed up by the ending  one minute we have an exciting helicopter stand off and the next we have a pay-off that is so lazy and so simplistic that I was actually visibly annoyed by it.

Passable entertainment if you are in an undemanding mood but it never even gets near the potential it had.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":126351,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1995-03-10","keywords":"virus,epidemic,monkey,disease,quarantine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Outbreak","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi547029273","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFmOGU2ODYtOTQ4Ni00YjJlLTkxMTEtZWQwZGI3YTlhZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFmOGU2ODYtOTQ4Ni00YjJlLTkxMTEtZWQwZGI3YTlhZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000163/","name":"Dustin Hoffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000623/","name":"Rene Russo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000583/","name":"Wolfgang Petersen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027715/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090684/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245435/","name":"Laurence Dworet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690798/","name":"Robert Roy Pool"],"duration":"PT2H7M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has the authenticity of a well-researched historical drama, up to and including dialogue delivered in a period accent and vocabulary (softened a bit so that it's easy to understand). Instead of drawing on historical events, though, it draws on historical folklore -- it's the story of witchcraft afflicting a family, such as might have been told at the time.\n\nThe characters are a very believable, ordinary family, with the sorts of tensions and problems you'd expect from people living a hard and substantially isolated life after being exiled from the local colonial town.

It has the authenticity of a well-researched historical drama, up to and including dialogue delivered in a period accent and vocabulary (softened a bit so that it's easy to understand). Instead of drawing on historical events, though, it draws on historical folklore -- it's the story of witchcraft afflicting a family, such as might have been told at the time.\n\nThe characters are a very believable, ordinary family, with the sorts of tensions and problems you'd expect from people living a hard and substantially isolated life after being exiled from the local colonial town. They also have period Calvinist attitudes, and the storytelling doesn't present an outsider's view of this or offer a modern commentary, but instead it just displays these attitudes and tells a story from the characters' standpoint.\n\nTheir reliance on period folklore means that it doesn't strictly follow modern horror movie tropes, either. It has the slow build of a modern psychological horror/thriller as well as the standard formula where tragedies start from tragic flaws, but the traditions it's drawing on depend on a Calvinist's conception of flaws, and treat witchcraft as a horrible, well-understood occurrence rather than a shocking supernatural surprise.
