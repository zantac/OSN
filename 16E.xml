If I hadn't heard the director mention on the DVD's audio commentary that there was lack of time and money, I'd still have noticed it easily from the quality jumps. At the beginning, you think this is going to be "Schindler's List II" or something like that, slowly enough building up the atmosphere before it's unfortunately too rushed afterwards. There are some brilliant scenes, my favorite is when the doctor says about the vampire: "This creature no longer has any bond to the moral laws of Man" - while he is just cutting him (it?) to pieces alive! That tells you more about what inhuman means than some highly acclaimed movies did: inability to realize how evil it all really is. However, there are some downfalls after that, especially the fight scenes are less spectacular than some in the previous two movies, and Bloodrayne's character isn't developed much, pretty much a ball in a pinball machine, same player shoots again... Actually the bad guys are more interesting, especially the lieutenant who is in doubt whether he should follow the doctor and the commandant, afraid they might turn him into a vampire, too. I voted 7-7-6 for the three movies."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6274,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2012-03-17","keywords":"vampire,snow,nazi,kung fu,half human","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bloodrayne: The Third Reich","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi289258009","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQzNGNiMzgtMTI2Zi00ZDJhLTk5ZjQtOGRlMWMyNzAxNTU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQzNGNiMzgtMTI2Zi00ZDJhLTk5ZjQtOGRlMWMyNzAxNTU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bloodrayne: The Third Reich"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0853573/","name":"Natassia Malthe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281956/","name":"Brendan Fletcher"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001595/","name":"Michael Paré"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093051/","name":"Uwe Boll"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065717/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0137814/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2359037/","name":"Michael Nachoff"}],"duration":"PT1H19M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If I hadn't heard the director mention on the DVD's audio commentary that there was lack of time and money, I'd still have noticed it easily from the quality jumps. At the beginning, you think this is going to be "Schindler's List II" or something like that, slowly enough building up the atmosphere before it's unfortunately too rushed afterwards. There are some brilliant scenes, my favorite is when the doctor says about the vampire: "This creature no longer has any bond to the moral laws of Man" - while he is just cutting him (it?) to pieces alive! That tells you more about what inhuman means than some highly acclaimed movies did: inability to realize how evil it all really is. However, there are some downfalls after that, especially the fight scenes are less spectacular than some in the previous two movies, and Bloodrayne's character isn't developed much, pretty much a ball in a pinball machine, same player shoots again... Actually the bad guys are more interesting, especially the lieutenant who is in doubt whether he should follow the doctor and the commandant, afraid they might turn him into a vampire, too. I voted 7-7-6 for the three movies.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6274,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2012-03-17","keywords":"vampire,snow,nazi,kung fu,half human","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bloodrayne: The Third Reich","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi289258009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQzNGNiMzgtMTI2Zi00ZDJhLTk5ZjQtOGRlMWMyNzAxNTU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQzNGNiMzgtMTI2Zi00ZDJhLTk5ZjQtOGRlMWMyNzAxNTU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bloodrayne: The Third Reich","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0853573/","name":"Natassia Malthe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281956/","name":"Brendan Fletcher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001595/","name":"Michael Paré"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093051/","name":"Uwe Boll"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021154/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065717/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0137814/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2359037/","name":"Michael Nachoff"],"duration":"PT1H19M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The hidden land in the most forbidding place on the planet not at either pole. In its day Lost Horrizon made quite a bit of money for its author James Hilton. But the real story of Heinrich Harrer is better than anything a fictional author could have thought up.\n\nBrad Pitt is Harrer in Seven Years In Tibet and this has become my favorite film of his. Heinrich Harrer, a world famous mountain climber and Austrian national hero goes on an expedition in 1939 to conquer an unclimbed peak in the Himalayas. While he's doing his mountain climbing Germany of which Austria is now part of marches into Poland and World War II begins. Harrer and his party are interred as enemy aliens.\n\nIn 1942 Harrer escaped and he and a friend played by David Thewlis make their way into Tibet. The rest of the film is the seven years he spent there, centered around the unique friendship he formed with the child ruler of Tibet, the Dalai Lama. This in fact is the same Dalai Lama who today is possibly the world's greatest and non-aligned apostle of the gospel of peace.\n\nBrad Pitt is never better in the film than he is with the three child actors who play the Dalai Lama at various stages of his life. The physical hardship that he and Thewlis endure just getting into Tibet is adventure enough. But the spiritual journey he undergoes in his time there makes this one of the most unique adventure stories of the last century.\n\nOne thing I liked about Seven Years in Tibet is that no effort was made to cover up Harrer's Nazi background. In an alternate universe one can speculate on what might have happened to him had he actually had to serve in the army in World War II. His internment saved him from possibly being involved any number of atrocities. God, fate, some kind of higher power saved him for something wonderful. \n\nThe cinematography is breathtaking, this film had an incredible number of locations. Note that it was shot in British Columbia, in Argentina with the Andes serving as the Himalayas, Austria and even some establishing footage was shot in Tibet itself on the sly.\n\nTibet's status is unique unto the world. It has been part of China since the Ming dynasty. It's referred to properly as the autonomous region of Tibet. China has given it autonomy in varying degrees over the past several centuries, it's never been truly independent. The Communist regime back in the days of Mao Tse-tung brutally asserted it's sovereignty a few times, most notably in late fifties when the Dalai Lama was forced to flee Tibet and live in Northern India where he resides to this day. That is when he's not traveling the world as it's foremost advocate of non-violence.\n\nIt is sad that this film did not get more box office than it did. Brad Pitt, David Thewlis, director Jean Jacques Arnaud are all persona non grata in the People's Republic of China for making this film. Quite a market indeed to be shut out of for a stand for humanity.\n\nIt's to be hoped that one day the Tibetans will be free. Until then they have their unique brand of Buddhism to sustain them and this wonderful film to tell their story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137177,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"1997-10-10","keywords":"tibet,dalai lama,based on real person,20th century,1940s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Seven Years in Tibet","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2667560729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA1NDc5NzQtYWJhZS00NDA0LTlkMzctNWZmN2MxZjUwOWIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA1NDc5NzQtYWJhZS00NDA0LTlkMzctNWZmN2MxZjUwOWIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000667/","name":"David Thewlis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000703/","name":"BD Wong"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000269/","name":"Jean-Jacques Annaud"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033437/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009331/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048014/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0364143/","name":"Heinrich Harrer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0426539/","name":"Becky Johnston"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The hidden land in the most forbidding place on the planet not at either pole. In its day Lost Horrizon made quite a bit of money for its author James Hilton. But the real story of Heinrich Harrer is better than anything a fictional author could have thought up.\n\nBrad Pitt is Harrer in Seven Years In Tibet and this has become my favorite film of his. Heinrich Harrer, a world famous mountain climber and Austrian national hero goes on an expedition in 1939 to conquer an unclimbed peak in the Himalayas. While he's doing his mountain climbing Germany of which Austria is now part of marches into Poland and World War II begins. Harrer and his party are interred as enemy aliens.\n\nIn 1942 Harrer escaped and he and a friend played by David Thewlis make their way into Tibet. The rest of the film is the seven years he spent there, centered around the unique friendship he formed with the child ruler of Tibet, the Dalai Lama. This in fact is the same Dalai Lama who today is possibly the world's greatest and non-aligned apostle of the gospel of peace.\n\nBrad Pitt is never better in the film than he is with the three child actors who play the Dalai Lama at various stages of his life. The physical hardship that he and Thewlis endure just getting into Tibet is adventure enough. But the spiritual journey he undergoes in his time there makes this one of the most unique adventure stories of the last century.\n\nOne thing I liked about Seven Years in Tibet is that no effort was made to cover up Harrer's Nazi background. In an alternate universe one can speculate on what might have happened to him had he actually had to serve in the army in World War II. His internment saved him from possibly being involved any number of atrocities. God, fate, some kind of higher power saved him for something wonderful. \n\nThe cinematography is breathtaking, this film had an incredible number of locations. Note that it was shot in British Columbia, in Argentina with the Andes serving as the Himalayas, Austria and even some establishing footage was shot in Tibet itself on the sly.\n\nTibet's status is unique unto the world. It has been part of China since the Ming dynasty. It's referred to properly as the autonomous region of Tibet. China has given it autonomy in varying degrees over the past several centuries, it's never been truly independent. The Communist regime back in the days of Mao Tse-tung brutally asserted it's sovereignty a few times, most notably in late fifties when the Dalai Lama was forced to flee Tibet and live in Northern India where he resides to this day. That is when he's not traveling the world as it's foremost advocate of non-violence.\n\nIt is sad that this film did not get more box office than it did. Brad Pitt, David Thewlis, director Jean Jacques Arnaud are all persona non grata in the People's Republic of China for making this film. Quite a market indeed to be shut out of for a stand for humanity.\n\nIt's to be hoped that one day the Tibetans will be free. Until then they have their unique brand of Buddhism to sustain them and this wonderful film to tell their story.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137177,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"1997-10-10","keywords":"tibet,dalai lama,based on real person,20th century,1940s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Seven Years in Tibet","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2667560729","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA1NDc5NzQtYWJhZS00NDA0LTlkMzctNWZmN2MxZjUwOWIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA1NDc5NzQtYWJhZS00NDA0LTlkMzctNWZmN2MxZjUwOWIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000667/","name":"David Thewlis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000703/","name":"BD Wong"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000269/","name":"Jean-Jacques Annaud"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033437/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009331/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048014/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0364143/","name":"Heinrich Harrer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0426539/","name":"Becky Johnston"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He is having an affair with his best friend's wife, Amanda. His best friend, Earl, knows about this, however. Thus he kills himself one day, and cleverly frames Clay for the murder. Clay, feeling both afraid and awkward, covers this incident up by making the death look like a suicide. The police fall for it and Clay puts this mess behind him. This film, both written and directed by newcomer David Dobkin, is the most original movie I have seen in a long while.

Joaquin Phoenix takes us though a funny joyride as he gets into more and more trouble as Clay. Let's not forget Georgina Cates, as the slutty wife of Earl. She plays cocky character who everyone loves to hate. The only character I could find is Janeane Garofalo's, who was surly inspired by Frances MacDormand from "Fargo."\n\nThe film's soundtrack is of the best there is, with songs that not only further the character's motives, but are also catchy and even describe some of the movie's plot at times. I have owned the soundtrack even before I saw the movie, which is quite unusual. But once I heard the theme song to "Clay Pigeons": "The Ballad of Lester Long," I had to get it.\n\n I do think that this movie could have been better, however. If it had left a few more elements to the imagination, like the guilt or innocence of Clay Birdwell, and the explicit murder and sex scenes, maybe the viewer would be l bit more involved into the story. A little less plot and a little fewer characters would have also been nice.\n\nBut those are but minor complaints. I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time, and I was not that disappointed. "Clay Pigeons" is one of the years most entertaining and original films.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11283,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1998-09-25","keywords":"anal sex,strong female character,murder of a nude woman,female nudity,nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Clay Pigeons","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2982019353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRkMjc1YmQtN2NhMy00YWZmLWI5NTctMDNjMDAyOGIyOWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRkMjc1YmQtN2NhMy00YWZmLWI5NTctMDNjMDAyOGIyOWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from PolyGram Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001618/","name":"Joaquin Phoenix"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000681/","name":"Vince Vaughn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000413/","name":"Janeane Garofalo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0229694/","name":"David Dobkin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176825/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071425/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010183/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0372356/","name":"Matthew L.

He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her "typical teenager" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His "purpose" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.\n\nMost films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to "move" its viewers as much as this movie.

While they are two detectives on the cast (Kevin Bacon and Daphne Rubin-Vega), they find out there's more than meets the eye in the mystery of deceit, sex and greed.\n\nDirected by John Mc Naughton (Herny:Portrait of a Serial Killer, Lansky, Normal Life) made an entertaining trashy noir that has an unique blend of sex, suspense, comedy and a twisted story. An terrific cast makes things enjoyable, which included:Theresa Russell, Robert Wagner and Bill Murray. This film wasn't much of a hit, when it was first released in the spring of 1998. But it turned into a cult hit on video. \n\nThe Unrated DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The Unrated DVD adds seven minutes of additional footage, which it has some good moments...especially during the end credits and the characters are more fleshed-out in the Unrated DVD. "Wild Things" has an good moody music score by George S. Clinton (Austin Powers Trilogy) and striking camera work by Jeffery L. Kimball (Jacob's Ladder, Stigmata, True Romance) are one of the highlights of this guilty pleasure film. Bacon is also the film's executive producer. Murray is a hoot in his minor role as Dillon's lawyer. Written by Stephen Peters. Panavision.

While they are two detectives on the cast (Kevin Bacon and Daphne Rubin-Vega), they find out there's more than meets the eye in the mystery of deceit, sex and greed.\n\nDirected by John Mc Naughton (Herny:Portrait of a Serial Killer, Lansky, Normal Life) made an entertaining trashy noir that has an unique blend of sex, suspense, comedy and a twisted story. An terrific cast makes things enjoyable, which included:Theresa Russell, Robert Wagner and Bill Murray. This film wasn't much of a hit, when it was first released in the spring of 1998. But it turned into a cult hit on video. \n\nThe Unrated DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The Unrated DVD adds seven minutes of additional footage, which it has some good moments...especially during the end credits and the characters are more fleshed-out in the Unrated DVD. "Wild Things" has an good moody music score by George S. Clinton (Austin Powers Trilogy) and striking camera work by Jeffery L. Kimball (Jacob's Ladder, Stigmata, True Romance) are one of the highlights of this guilty pleasure film. Bacon is also the film's executive producer. Murray is a hoot in his minor role as Dillon's lawyer. Written by Stephen Peters. Panavision.

We can almost feel it, and so can the hero, as he walks through his house, armed with a weapon, ready to defend himself at all costs. He hears a noise from somewhere behind him, spins around, and suddenly realizes it was just his imagination. He sighs, puts down the weapon, turns around, and BOO! There's the bad guy, who has somehow managed to enter the locked home and avoid being detected. What if, I wonder, one of these times, the bad guy was seen as he entered? What if the Fisherman from "I Know What You Did Last Summer" had been spotted, and confronted, by one of the teenagers? What if Norman Bates' "Mother" had been exposed from the start? Then there presumably would be no movie, of course.\n\nAlthough we know where "Secret Window" is headed quite early on, David Koepp (writer of "Panic Room" and director of the well-made "Stir of Echoes") manages to sustain the audience's interest through a series of suspenseful camera shots. Some are inventive, while others are merely fun to watch because we can guess where Koepp got his inspiration.\n\nMort Rainey (Johnny Depp) is a successful author who lives up north with his beloved dog and a laptop. He apparently abandons his social life, never gets a haircut, and wears quite silly-looking glasses. He has a sarcastic personality and presumably does not get along very well with the local residents, who generally keep to themselves anyway.\n\nMort's life is changed forever when a strange man named John Shooter (John Turturro) shows up at his doorstep claiming that Mort has "stolen" his story. Mort is handed a dirty manuscript. Within the pages are passages literally identical to those from Mort's own book, "Secret Window," published in 1994, three years before John claims he wrote his. "Secret Window," the novel, is about a man whose wife cheats on him. Fueled by rage, the fictional character murders his own wife and buries her in the "secret garden" located outside of the "secret window" of their home.\n\nIt is said that art imitates life, and through a series of flashbacks we learn that Mort's novel bears an eerie similarity to his own problems -- "six months ago" his wife (Maria Bello) had an affair with Ted (Timothy Hutton). Mort assumes that John Shooter has some sort of connection to his past, and hires a detective (Charles S. Dutton) to find the mysterious man, who always seems to appear out of nowhere when Mort is alone.\n\nDepp's performance is the highlight of the film -- if Depp is imitating Stephen King (the author of the short story "Secret Window" is based on), he succeeds. Barely recognizable hidden underneath a layer of geeky clothing and a generally disheveled appearance, Depp once again proves that he can tackle any sort of role as an actor -- from a scared teenager who has to stay up ("A Nightmare on Elm Street") to a Hunter S. Thompson lookalike ("Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas").\n\nKoepp, who wrote the screenplay for the film, realizes that the key to the story is Depp's performance wisely allows his primary actor to let loose. Meanwhile the co-stars all deliver fine, convincing performances and although the grand finale is a bit of a let-down, and terribly predictable, the movie's style is interesting. "Secret Window" is better than most in its genre, although by no means is it a masterpiece of any sort. Just an enjoyable Friday/Saturday night matinée, and worthy of recommendation if you're not looking for anything special.\n\nI could criticize the "twist" of the movie and say that it has become one of the most overused solutions to Hollywood film thriller/mysteries of the past decade, but I won't spoil it, and let you decide for yourself whether it does the story justice."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":188855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2004-04-21","keywords":"page torn from a book,writer,cabin,investigator,stranger","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Secret Window","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1235468569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBkNWQ5OTYtZmFmMS00NTE4LTg5MmEtZmI4ZDJlOWVkZWQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBkNWQ5OTYtZmFmMS00NTE4LTg5MmEtZmI4ZDJlOWVkZWQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004742/","name":"Maria Bello"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001806/","name":"John Turturro"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057553/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0140758/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000175/","name":"Stephen King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Just an enjoyable Friday/Saturday night matinée, and worthy of recommendation if you're not looking for anything special.\n\nI could criticize the "twist" of the movie and say that it has become one of the most overused solutions to Hollywood film thriller/mysteries of the past decade, but I won't spoil it, and let you decide for yourself whether it does the story justice.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":188855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2004-04-21","keywords":"page torn from a book,writer,cabin,investigator,stranger","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Secret Window","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1235468569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBkNWQ5OTYtZmFmMS00NTE4LTg5MmEtZmI4ZDJlOWVkZWQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBkNWQ5OTYtZmFmMS00NTE4LTg5MmEtZmI4ZDJlOWVkZWQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004742/","name":"Maria Bello","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001806/","name":"John Turturro"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057553/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0140758/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000175/","name":"Stephen King","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In the opening scenes we see the President's daughter, Alexandra (Taylor Momsen from "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"), as a special guest at a futuristic amusement park. When Alexandra gets herself in trouble on a ride called the Juggler (which actually juggles the cars containing the passengers!), Carmen and Juni are dispatched to help her. But then a backup Spy Kids team of Gary (Matt O'Leary from "Frailty") and Gerti (Emily Osment, sister of Haley Joel) Giggles are sent in as well. The situation becomes competitive, with the Cortezes rescuing Alexandra while the Giggleses retrieve the dangerous device (the Transmooger) that she had stolen from her father's office.\n\nAs in the first film, Carmen and Juni's parents are Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino), who are also spies working for OSS. Gregorio is up for a major promotion, but like his children, he is also competing with the Giggles family. The dinner at which the winner of this promotion is announced is the launching pad for the heart of the film.\n\nOther key characters returning from the first film are uncle "Machete" Cortez (Danny Trejo) and Felix Gumm (Cheech Marin). And then there is Doctor Romero (Steve Buscemi), who is a very interesting character.\n\nThe "film" was actually shot using high definition video, which looked good enough to never be a distraction. It had been transferred to film for exhibition, so the normal film wear and tear issues applied, especially since I saw it near the tail end of its theatrical run.\n\nBesides using digital video, the director (Robert Rodriguez) also used another trick to save money: he did almost everything himself. He was the writer, cinematographer, editor, production designer, and visual effects supervisor, and also helped produce and score the film. Apparently he did much of this work in his garage in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe first film was very fun and unexpected. This one feels a *little* too much like more of the same, and it also adds a touch more gross humor than I think it needed to. It's still fun and definitely worth at least a rental, but it's not *quite* up to the level of the first film.\n\nSeen on 10/9/2002.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65001,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-12-25","keywords":"machete cortez character,close up of eye,espionage,good versus evil,close up of eyes","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3814195481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y4ODM3MTktYmE1Yi00NmM1LWI2N2ItMjE1NTExZDc1Y2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y4ODM3MTktYmE1Yi00NmM1LWI2N2ItMjE1NTExZDc1Y2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT#3"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891786/","name":"Alexa PenaVega"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0754512/","name":"Daryl Sabara"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035848/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In the opening scenes we see the President's daughter, Alexandra (Taylor Momsen from "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"), as a special guest at a futuristic amusement park. When Alexandra gets herself in trouble on a ride called the Juggler (which actually juggles the cars containing the passengers!), Carmen and Juni are dispatched to help her. But then a backup Spy Kids team of Gary (Matt O'Leary from "Frailty") and Gerti (Emily Osment, sister of Haley Joel) Giggles are sent in as well. The situation becomes competitive, with the Cortezes rescuing Alexandra while the Giggleses retrieve the dangerous device (the Transmooger) that she had stolen from her father's office.\n\nAs in the first film, Carmen and Juni's parents are Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino), who are also spies working for OSS. Gregorio is up for a major promotion, but like his children, he is also competing with the Giggles family. The dinner at which the winner of this promotion is announced is the launching pad for the heart of the film.\n\nOther key characters returning from the first film are uncle "Machete" Cortez (Danny Trejo) and Felix Gumm (Cheech Marin). And then there is Doctor Romero (Steve Buscemi), who is a very interesting character.\n\nThe "film" was actually shot using high definition video, which looked good enough to never be a distraction. It had been transferred to film for exhibition, so the normal film wear and tear issues applied, especially since I saw it near the tail end of its theatrical run.\n\nBesides using digital video, the director (Robert Rodriguez) also used another trick to save money: he did almost everything himself. He was the writer, cinematographer, editor, production designer, and visual effects supervisor, and also helped produce and score the film. Apparently he did much of this work in his garage in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe first film was very fun and unexpected. This one feels a *little* too much like more of the same, and it also adds a touch more gross humor than I think it needed to. It's still fun and definitely worth at least a rental, but it's not *quite* up to the level of the first film.\n\nSeen on 10/9/2002.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65001,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-12-25","keywords":"machete cortez character,close up of eye,espionage,good versus evil,close up of eyes","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3814195481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y4ODM3MTktYmE1Yi00NmM1LWI2N2ItMjE1NTExZDc1Y2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y4ODM3MTktYmE1Yi00NmM1LWI2N2ItMjE1NTExZDc1Y2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT#3","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891786/","name":"Alexa PenaVega","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0754512/","name":"Daryl Sabara","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035848/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He is having an affair with his best friend's wife, Amanda. His best friend, Earl, knows about this, however. Thus he kills himself one day, and cleverly frames Clay for the murder. Clay, feeling both afraid and awkward, covers this incident up by making the death look like a suicide. The police fall for it and Clay puts this mess behind him. This film, both written and directed by newcomer David Dobkin, is the most original movie I have seen in a long while. Think about it, we haven't had a movie this clever and blackly comic since "Fargo," possible one of the best movies I have ever scene. The characters are so unique, while they don't generate much sympathy from the audience; they still are extremely fun to watch.\n\nThe performances are another great element in the movie. Vince Vaughn portrays Lester Long like he did in the recent "Psycho" remake. His style, giggle, attitude, and presence are all priceless. Joaquin Phoenix takes us though a funny joyride as he gets into more and more trouble as Clay. Let's not forget Georgina Cates, as the slutty wife of Earl. She plays cocky character who everyone loves to hate. The only character I could find is Janeane Garofalo's, who was surly inspired by Frances MacDormand from "Fargo."\n\nThe film's soundtrack is of the best there is, with songs that not only further the character's motives, but are also catchy and even describe some of the movie's plot at times. I have owned the soundtrack even before I saw the movie, which is quite unusual. But once I heard the theme song to "Clay Pigeons": "The Ballad of Lester Long," I had to get it.\n\n I do think that this movie could have been better, however. If it had left a few more elements to the imagination, like the guilt or innocence of Clay Birdwell, and the explicit murder and sex scenes, maybe the viewer would be l bit more involved into the story. A little less plot and a little fewer characters would have also been nice.\n\nBut those are but minor complaints. I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time, and I was not that disappointed. "Clay Pigeons" is one of the years most entertaining and original films.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11283,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1998-09-25","keywords":"anal sex,strong female character,murder of a nude woman,female nudity,nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Clay Pigeons","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2982019353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRkMjc1YmQtN2NhMy00YWZmLWI5NTctMDNjMDAyOGIyOWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRkMjc1YmQtN2NhMy00YWZmLWI5NTctMDNjMDAyOGIyOWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from PolyGram Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001618/","name":"Joaquin Phoenix"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000681/","name":"Vince Vaughn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000413/","name":"Janeane Garofalo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0229694/","name":"David Dobkin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176825/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071425/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010183/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0372356/","name":"Matthew L.

    <desc lang="hr">Twins: Directed by Ivan Reitman. With Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny DeVito, Kelly Preston, Chloe Webb. A physically perfect but innocent man goes in search of his long-lost twin brother, who is short, a womanizer, and small-time crook." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0096320/","name":"Twins","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWUzN2VkY2ItYmQ4YS00MjFmLWJhZDQtYWY1NWQ2NTA5NDNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDc2NjEyMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A physically perfect but innocent man goes in search of his long-lost twin brother, who is short, a womanizer, and small-time crook.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0096320/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"ElMaruecan82"},"dateCreated":"2019-10-20","inLanguage":"English","name":"Danny and Arnie... or when comedies had warmth and innocence.","reviewBody":"1953, a super-secret scientific experiment aims to make a perfect man out of six "contributors" who include Nobel Prize winners and athletes and a beautiful woman to be inoculated with the seminal milkshake. But as usual when men play sorcerer apprentices, science finds its way to trick them and when the super-baby raises his cute little nose, it's revealed a few seconds later that Mommy carried a clandestine passenger all along.\n\nLife found a way in a little boy who's nothing like his big brother is (literally) and there comes another comedy relying on science and the mysteries of life from Ivan Reitman, after "Ghosbusters" and before "Junior". The title shot says it all, the big blonde baby is Arnold Schwarzenegger and the little one who kicks him in the leg is Danny De Vito, such a cute and tender moment for a blockbuster comedy... because it's a comedy. Boys separated at birth and reuniting for a vengeance has been an excuse for lousy action pictures but who needs action when characters are driven by family love.\n\nWhat "Twins" accomplishes is remarkable in its simplicity, it takes the established comedic persona of Danny De Vito and associates it to one no viewer would have anticipated in 1988. Consider that in '87, Arnie had played one of his ultimate action roles in "Predator" and it was right after "Terminator", "Commando" and the "Conan" series. Just when he was about to be typecast, Arnie takes a 180° turn and plays a man who's strong and muscular all right but never at the expenses of his good nature, his endless love for his brother and his nerdy attributes. Remember that McBain gag in "The Simpsons" where he played a nerd, it's a credit for Arnie to never make his Julius Benedict a similar subject of ridicule, he's genuinely funny because he never means to. For the same reason, even the preposterous premise of having him pregnant in "Junior" worked beautifully.\n\nBut "Twins" accomplishes something more, it pairs up the most two different possible actors, body and personality-wise to make it part of the plot, it's one thing to make them brothers, but talk about suspension of disbelief when we're asked to believe they're twins. That's the stuff comedic gold can be made of and in the crucial moment where Julius reveals his identity to Vincent, from each sides of a visiting room, Vincent's reaction is priceless: "it was like looking in the mirror", "we're not identical twins" retorts Julius and Vincent's face is another credit to De Vito's talent, it says "oh that explains it all" with a hint of "no kidding?". And apart from a few moments that insist on their telepathic connections (scratching their bottom in the same time, Vincent naming his cat Julius and Julius naming his computer Vincent) the film never overplays it to the point it becomes a cheap gimmick, and in the 80s, it's quite an achievement.\n\nI guess that's the third accomplishment of "Twins", it has a deep and touching warmth of its own that plays like a wonderful tribute to brotherhood that transcends the differences. Danny and Arnie share the screen literally as they never try to steal one scene from another. And when Julius tries to follow his brothers' steps: how to make up with girls, how to flirt, to dance, to prepare for the big night (because Julius is a virgin) it's funny and goofy but it's played with balance by Arnie who's got a lot of comedic potential, certainly more than his rival Stallone. I criticized Sly for being too "straight" even in comedic roles such as "Demolition Man", but that same year, Arnie delivered a great self-parodic performance in "Last Action Hero" and hints of that truetalent is displayed in "Twins". Take that scene when he's teased by the beautiful Kelly Preston, he knows he is but he plays his Julius as an embarrassed man, never embarrassing. Naturally, she stops playing with him and takes full rein.\n\n"Twins" contains two romances, Arnie and Preston while De Vito is with the more jovial and ordinary-looking Chloe Webb and together they have a great chemistry. Heart is something that never deserts the film and contributes to some weirdly effective serious moments, Julius' childish joy meeting the athletic dad, Vincent learning that he was the undeserved one by the doctor prick followed by the heartwarming moment when Julius comforts him by reminding him that it's not just a matter of nature but nurture as well, he lived in a Pacific Island surrounded by love while he grew up in an orphanage thinking his mom abandoned him.\n\nIt's all natural that one brother would learn the tricks of modern life and the other to be a little less rough when it comes to handle the sweet aspects of life. Isolated they were alone and marginal, together they form a great duo immortalized by that iconic moment where they cockily walk across the street with the same suit, certainly one of the 80's most instantly identifiable moments. Of course, the crime plot is here to give some spice to the narrative but it never indulges to the basic clichés, no chase, no shootouts, and Arnie is only strong when necessary but despises violence. It all comes down to the real climax of the film not being about action or money but a magical reunion between a mother and her lost sons.\n\n"Twins" takes me back to the early 90s when Saturdays evening featured comedies and comedies of that era had such an innocence I truly miss them (though Kelly Preston awakened one of my earliest pre-teen impulses and her presence is one of the things I most cherish about the film).\n\n(and for the first time, I post the 100th review of a film)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1988-12-09","keywords":"brother,long lost siblings,new mexico,lost mother,desert island","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Twins","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1205862681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhjZGQ1ODktZWM5Yi00ZGU4LWIzMzQtZjNhM2M5Y2Y1M2IxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhjZGQ1ODktZWM5Yi00ZGU4LWIzMzQtZjNhM2M5Y2Y1M2IxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000362/","name":"Danny DeVito"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000593/","name":"Kelly Preston"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718645/","name":"Ivan Reitman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204030/","name":"William Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0651758/","name":"William Osborne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365390/","name":"Timothy Harris"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is a classic among horror films. Definitely a necessity for horror enthusiasts to watch!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399420,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-05-18","keywords":"surprise ending,locked in a room,trapped in a room,mind game,flashback","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi8957721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1MDc0NzE3NDBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDk2NTEyODIx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1MDc0NzE3NDBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDk2NTEyODIx._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the 10th Anniversary trailer for Saw.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000144/","name":"Cary Elwes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1191481/","name":"Leigh Whannell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000418/","name":"Danny Glover"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021715/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0115136/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0137447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1191481/","name":"Leigh Whannell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The government can't tax it. Yet sports betting is a $200 billion a year business. A business that strives to exploit every vulnerability, manipulate every gullibility, and convince the client that it can provide them certainty in an uncertain world.\n\nTwo for the Money is the story of one man's journey into the sports gambling world. Matthew McConaughey delivers one of his more impressive performances as he transforms from Brandon Lang, the smooth-talking golden boy, into John Anthony - "The Million Dollar Man with the Billion Dollar Plan." A transformation that comes complete with a new suit, a new car, a new attitude, and slicked back hair - a sure-fire movie sign that corruption or a loss of innocence is imminent.\n\nPortraying a character that must deal with this corruption of innocence, McConaughey demonstrates that he can act with more than just his dimples and down-home Southern charm. Lang is a machine. He knows the teams, the leagues, the players, the game. All he does is work out and pick winners, two facts made abundantly clear by McConaughey's propensity to walk around shirtless just as often as he makes football picks. I may have rolled my eyes once or twice, but I heard nary a complaint from the ladies in the audience. Except for that one that looked a little like my Uncle Larry.\n\nLang's corruption rests solely on the fragile shoulders of Walter Abrams, a sleazy character played so effortlessly by Al Pacino that you can't help but feel slightly disturbed by the ease with which he seems capable of tainting ambitious young men. Screaming less than usual, Pacino's portrayal is nothing short of an indictment of those sports advisors who feed on the weak. Sports gambling may be illegal in 46 states, but Abrams is well aware that "sports advising" (the politically correct preference, no doubt) is not. Despite the false promise of certainty, sports advising is presented as more used car salesmanship than mathematical study. Figure out your client's needs, and get his money. That's the name of the game. As for actually picking a winner? It's 50-50. A flip of the coin.\n\nSure, Lang is able to compile a pretty impressive hot streak, but what happens when it comes to a crashing halt? The peaks are indeed very high when the fun and money are flowing, but is it worth the lesson learned when your family is threatened and you're hit with the realization of what losing $380,000 can do to a family? \n\nUltimately, the movie would have proved more effective if there had been a greater emphasis on the devastation of the lows of losing. Consequences are touched but never fully realized. I would have also liked less predictability in a movie about a very unpredictable lifestyle, but Two for the Money still succeeds in giving the audience a glimpse of what gets in the minds of those willing to gamble. Is it about the game? Is it about the money? Or, as Abrams believes, is it about the risk some people are willing to take to feel what they perceive as being alive?\n\nThe dialogue and character interaction happen at a quick enough pace to grab and seal your attention, and while the last act is somewhat weighed down by the two-hour runtime and the semi-sappy melodrama of plans gone awry, Money still manages to convince the audience to care about whether or not Brandon can get back to where he began - the purity of the game.\n\nYou want certainty in an uncertain world? Then put your money on obligatory shirtless Matthew McConaughey scenes and Pacino's incisors getting a nice scene-chewing workout. It's a safer bet than trusting your money with the decision-making of those who care more about the profit than they do about you.\n\nTHE GIST \n\nTwo for the Money will prove to be most enjoyable to those with some familiarity or interest with sports and the gambling side of the business. But McConaughey and Pacino deliver enough laughs and energy to make this more accessible to those with little knowledge of the subject matter. If you have your doubts about this one then don't worry about spending the big bucks to see it on the big screen - it'll make for a good rental.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44972,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2006-11-29","keywords":"father son relationship,female frontal nudity,football,injury,addiction","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Two for the Money","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1675624729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmZiZjFlZjAtNmJkNS00N2NiLWJmMzMtYjMxMmNlMzc1ODNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmZiZjFlZjAtNmJkNS00N2NiLWJmMzMtYjMxMmNlMzc1ODNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000190/","name":"Matthew McConaughey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000623/","name":"Rene Russo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0142286/","name":"D.J.

It took great leaps away from the source material, but managed to be cute, funny, colorful, and heart-warming.\n\nWell, at least the sequel is three of these things.\n\nCloudy 2 is filled with tongue-in-cheek puns, and honestly has some of the best 3D animation I've seen. Its true! Its better than the first, with attention to detail. All the food animals are bright, creative, and adorable.\n\nThe movie is just as fun as the last, perhaps even more...but, like most animated sequels, the plot and character take a nosedive. The first focused on love, inspiration, and family relationship. The second is the typical friendship shtick and has a strangely pro-vegan message. I mean, some of these food animals have human-like intelligence, but a lot are no different from chickens and cattle. :V \n\nThe characters are worse-off from the original.

It took great leaps away from the source material, but managed to be cute, funny, colorful, and heart-warming.\n\nWell, at least the sequel is three of these things.\n\nCloudy 2 is filled with tongue-in-cheek puns, and honestly has some of the best 3D animation I've seen. Its true! Its better than the first, with attention to detail. All the food animals are bright, creative, and adorable.\n\nThe movie is just as fun as the last, perhaps even more...but, like most animated sequels, the plot and character take a nosedive. The first focused on love, inspiration, and family relationship. The second is the typical friendship shtick and has a strangely pro-vegan message. I mean, some of these food animals have human-like intelligence, but a lot are no different from chickens and cattle. :V \n\nThe characters are worse-off from the original. Brent, Manny, and Earl have no role in this film. Manny and Earl were at least funny, but Brent just spouted his "UH OH!" shtick.

But remember:  once you start this game, you can't stop.  If it takes you over twenty years to finish, finish you must.\n\n"Jumanji" is loosely based on the Caldecott Medal-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  The basic premise stays the same:  a sister and brother find a strange game based on a jungle safari adventure.  When they begin playing it, they find they cannot stop, for the characters and events of the game come to life and start filling their house with monkeys, lions, explorers and other strange things.  Only finishing the game will make it all go away.\n\nIn the hands of Hollywood, more story is added.  Now we have a game spanning 26 years, when one of the two children playing the game in 1969 gets sucked into the game itself.  He's trapped there until a fresh pair of children in 1995 find the game and begin playing.  The right number is rolled, and out Alan comes...as Robin Williams!  Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter.\n\nRobin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles.  He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the "This is MY baby" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":324501,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"1995-12-15","keywords":"board game,adventurer,fight,game,year 1995","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Jumanji","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2677211417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ2Njc1MGUtNDYyYi00YTQxLTk0YTYtZjkzYWRhZTAyNWM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ2Njc1MGUtNDYyYi00YTQxLTk0YTYtZjkzYWRhZTAyNWM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"text os"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001372/","name":"Bonnie Hunt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002653/","name":"Joe Johnston"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060719/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378144/","name":"Jonathan Hensleigh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852430/","name":"Greg Taylor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0833164/","name":"Jim Strain"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Finding the grown girl to complete the group, the four must complete the game before their town is destroyed by the stampeding rhinos, killer pod vines and crazed Great White Hunter.\n\nRobin has some good moments in this film, though he isn't allowed to riff as much as in other vehicles.  He's supported by an excellent cast, including a young Kirsten Dunst as the sister of the new pair of children; Jonathan Hyde as both the 1969 father and Van Pelt, the Great White Hunter from the game; and Bebe Neuwirth as the modern children's aunt.  The effects are, not surprisingly, ILM-excellent -- necessary in a film of this type.  The script was co-written by Van Allsburg to insure the atmosphere of the film and book mesh, but he did not fall into the "This is MY baby" syndrome, and received good help from his two co-writers (for details, see the main page).  Highly recommended for old and young alike.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":324501,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"1995-12-15","keywords":"board game,adventurer,fight,game,year 1995","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Jumanji","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2677211417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ2Njc1MGUtNDYyYi00YTQxLTk0YTYtZjkzYWRhZTAyNWM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ2Njc1MGUtNDYyYi00YTQxLTk0YTYtZjkzYWRhZTAyNWM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"text os","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001372/","name":"Bonnie Hunt"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002653/","name":"Joe Johnston"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031772/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060719/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378144/","name":"Jonathan Hensleigh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852430/","name":"Greg Taylor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0833164/","name":"Jim Strain"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Since the 70's, three of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, and Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. These three movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that Gladiator director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden's book, Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.\n\nFor whatever reason, I don't remember hearing much about the civil war in Somalia or about the Battle of Mogadishu on which Black Hawk Down is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn't take long for the operation to go completely FUBAR as two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Things went from bad to worse, as the Rangers found themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal was to shoot any American soldier that invaded their space. After "stirring up the hornet's nest", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the Rangers motto, "Leave No Man Behind".\n\nNeedless to say, Ridley Scott has made the ultimate war movie with Black Hawk Down. Unlike some war films that temper the battle with slower character-building sequences, you have to wait only thirty minutes for the Rangers' mission to go into effect. And the action doesn't stop for the next two hours, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, explosions and bloodshed. The fighting is so chaotic that it is hard to follow the action and tell what is happening, at times, and it becomes almost too easy to become desensitized to the violence. By the third time someone yells "RPG's!" though, the entire audience knows to duck and cover their ears.\n\nWhile the American soldiers go in with a solid plan, it doesn't take long for panic to set in, and pretty soon, you're not sure which side is more disorganized. It's amazing to watch what seems like thousands of extras playing the Somali militia swarming over the soldiers, and the action and camerawork is reminiscent of a video game as the soldiers try to escape their precarious situation through the streets of Mogadishu. As the movie progresses, the tension continues to build as the grim and unrelenting hopelessness of the situation sets in both for the soldiers and the viewer.\n\nIt's pretty amazing how much has been made of the 19 downed American soldiers when over 1000 Somali men, women, and children were killed during the raid. While the movie is clearly weighed towards the American perspective, I can't imagine how it must have felt to be the guy who gets to play "Dead Somali with a Gun #354".\n\nAlthough characterization has always been used extensively in war movies to get the viewer to care about the characters, Black Hawk Down works better because, for the most part, the soldiers are personified as little more than grunts in the field doing the bidding of their superiors. At least the soldiers had their names taped to their helmets, so that this didn't have the problem of some war movies, where it's sometimes hard to tell who is who. Some of the best performances of the film come from Tom Sizemore as the gung-ho Lt. McKnight and Josh Hartnett, who plays the sergeant who leads the mission and feels personal guilt every time a man is lost. Sam Shepard also is excellent as Major General William Garrison, who sits back in the safe zone watching his doomed men be overpowered by the enemy. Eric Bana's part is small, but he has some of the best lines in the film, really driving home the point of why soldiers do what they do. Ewan McGregor's role is even more minor and insignificant, but his Trainspotting compatriot, Ewen Bremner offers the movie's little bit of comic relief.\n\nAs expected in a Ridley Scott film, the visuals and camerawork are stunning with the movie having a gray almost monochromatic look that makes the orange flames and red blood really stand out. As is typical in Scott's recent movies, there is lots of flying dust, rubble and debris mixed with slow motion shots of falling bullet casings and splattered blood. He also uses animals and non-military personnel well in some of the shots to show that this firefight is happening in the middle of a populated market district.\n\nA big deal has been made out of the blood and gore in Black Hawk Down, but what is any true war movie without it? Though most of the graphic violence on display is not far beyond Saving Private Ryan, there is at least one visceral sequence that will make most people squeamish, unless they watch those operation shows on The Learning Channel for entertainment. Black Hawk Down is quite an achievement in creating a realistic representation of an event in recent history. Most of this movie leaves the viewer aghast and incredulous of what they're watching, and it's hard to believe that something like this could possibly happen. Technically, this movie is an amazing feat that gives the viewer one of the most realistic impressions of what it would feel like to be in the middle of a war, which makes the atrocities of the event seem all the more real.\n\nIn a genre that has brought out some of the best in directors and actors, Black Hawk Down is easily the best war movie ever made, and it has replaced A Beautiful Mind as my candidate for Best Picture and Director.\n\nRating: 10 out of 10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":378101,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2002-03-27","keywords":"somalia,u.s. army,gunfight,peacekeeper,chaos","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Black Hawk Down","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1809188377","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Black Hawk Down"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001326/","name":"Josh Hartnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001744/","name":"Tom Sizemore"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026281/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100736/","name":"Mark Bowden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634307/","name":"Ken Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Since the 70's, three of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, and Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. These three movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that Gladiator director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden's book, Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.\n\nFor whatever reason, I don't remember hearing much about the civil war in Somalia or about the Battle of Mogadishu on which Black Hawk Down is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn't take long for the operation to go completely FUBAR as two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Things went from bad to worse, as the Rangers found themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal was to shoot any American soldier that invaded their space. After "stirring up the hornet's nest", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the Rangers motto, "Leave No Man Behind".\n\nNeedless to say, Ridley Scott has made the ultimate war movie with Black Hawk Down. Unlike some war films that temper the battle with slower character-building sequences, you have to wait only thirty minutes for the Rangers' mission to go into effect. And the action doesn't stop for the next two hours, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, explosions and bloodshed. The fighting is so chaotic that it is hard to follow the action and tell what is happening, at times, and it becomes almost too easy to become desensitized to the violence. By the third time someone yells "RPG's!" though, the entire audience knows to duck and cover their ears.\n\nWhile the American soldiers go in with a solid plan, it doesn't take long for panic to set in, and pretty soon, you're not sure which side is more disorganized. It's amazing to watch what seems like thousands of extras playing the Somali militia swarming over the soldiers, and the action and camerawork is reminiscent of a video game as the soldiers try to escape their precarious situation through the streets of Mogadishu. As the movie progresses, the tension continues to build as the grim and unrelenting hopelessness of the situation sets in both for the soldiers and the viewer.\n\nIt's pretty amazing how much has been made of the 19 downed American soldiers when over 1000 Somali men, women, and children were killed during the raid. While the movie is clearly weighed towards the American perspective, I can't imagine how it must have felt to be the guy who gets to play "Dead Somali with a Gun #354".\n\nAlthough characterization has always been used extensively in war movies to get the viewer to care about the characters, Black Hawk Down works better because, for the most part, the soldiers are personified as little more than grunts in the field doing the bidding of their superiors. At least the soldiers had their names taped to their helmets, so that this didn't have the problem of some war movies, where it's sometimes hard to tell who is who. Some of the best performances of the film come from Tom Sizemore as the gung-ho Lt. McKnight and Josh Hartnett, who plays the sergeant who leads the mission and feels personal guilt every time a man is lost. Sam Shepard also is excellent as Major General William Garrison, who sits back in the safe zone watching his doomed men be overpowered by the enemy. Eric Bana's part is small, but he has some of the best lines in the film, really driving home the point of why soldiers do what they do. Ewan McGregor's role is even more minor and insignificant, but his Trainspotting compatriot, Ewen Bremner offers the movie's little bit of comic relief.\n\nAs expected in a Ridley Scott film, the visuals and camerawork are stunning with the movie having a gray almost monochromatic look that makes the orange flames and red blood really stand out. As is typical in Scott's recent movies, there is lots of flying dust, rubble and debris mixed with slow motion shots of falling bullet casings and splattered blood. He also uses animals and non-military personnel well in some of the shots to show that this firefight is happening in the middle of a populated market district.\n\nA big deal has been made out of the blood and gore in Black Hawk Down, but what is any true war movie without it? Though most of the graphic violence on display is not far beyond Saving Private Ryan, there is at least one visceral sequence that will make most people squeamish, unless they watch those operation shows on The Learning Channel for entertainment. Black Hawk Down is quite an achievement in creating a realistic representation of an event in recent history. Most of this movie leaves the viewer aghast and incredulous of what they're watching, and it's hard to believe that something like this could possibly happen. Technically, this movie is an amazing feat that gives the viewer one of the most realistic impressions of what it would feel like to be in the middle of a war, which makes the atrocities of the event seem all the more real.\n\nIn a genre that has brought out some of the best in directors and actors, Black Hawk Down is easily the best war movie ever made, and it has replaced A Beautiful Mind as my candidate for Best Picture and Director.\n\nRating: 10 out of 10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":378101,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2002-03-27","keywords":"somalia,u.s. army,gunfight,peacekeeper,chaos","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Black Hawk Down","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1809188377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRkODRmMDEtYmI3Ni00MmQ4LWI2NDktYzY2ZDc2MmE5NTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Black Hawk Down","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001326/","name":"Josh Hartnett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001744/","name":"Tom Sizemore"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026281/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100736/","name":"Mark Bowden","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634307/","name":"Ken Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This isn't as good as the first movie. Having said that, one of my tests for any horror movie is whether it has the ability to scare you and make you jump. This one does that, so I have to call it a good movie. It has a lot of chills and jump out of your seat moments, my wife actually screamed at least twice that I recall. It works, in other words. That fright quality isn't as sustained as it is in the first movie, though. In fact, this is pretty slow off the top. A few people board an airplane and they're not feeling too well.

Quarantine 2 takes a more standard approach to movie-making. I think the hand held camera idea has been done to death, quite frankly, so I didn't miss it. It's clear that the ending of this movie was also intended to set up another potential sequel. That was just a little too obvious.

It shows much, tells some, and demands of the viewer some thought. This is not something always appreciated by the viewer. The key to understanding this movie, I believe, is not the search for the reincarnation of an important Buddhist teacher, nor is it the life of the Buddha up to the time he achieves enlightenment, but the way a child, or children, and an old man, come to understand together something of the connections that may exist between themselves. We don't see through a character's eyes, we watch the effects of the characters on each other. In particular, Jesse, the 9 year old American who may or may not be the reincarnation, holds our attention because we watch him absorb the lessons that are being taught, and as he learns them, he grows in ways we can expect a 9 year old to grow. We also watch his father, whose character becomes more sympathetic as the movie progresses, who has even further to grow than his son, because he has already learned too much.\n\nThe movie is also beautiful to watch. The cinematography, the editing and the direction combine to provide just the right dramatic tension to a movie whose pacing is deceptive, in that it seems slow, but is not. The ultimate result is that a viewer who allows it, will find him or herself transported for a little while, to unexpected places.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16454,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1993-12-01","keywords":"reincarnation,nonlinear timeline,buddhist,seattle washington,buddhism","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Little Buddha","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2700058137","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEyNzNmZjYtZjU4Ni00MGM1LTk4MTMtMTJmY2U1NGQ3NDkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEyNzNmZjYtZjU4Ni00MGM1LTk4MTMtMTJmY2U1NGQ3NDkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000206/","name":"Keanu Reeves"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000403/","name":"Bridget Fonda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0948078/","name":"Ruocheng Ying"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000934/","name":"Bernardo Bertolucci"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008195/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164812/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029168/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000934/","name":"Bernardo Bertolucci"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0943382/","name":"Rudy Wurlitzer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672546/","name":"Mark Peploe"}],"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I recommend seeing it, though on my Boo Hoo Meter, it doesn't even rate, for not a single tear spilled from my eyes, it wasn't that kind of film. It actually was quite a bit scarier than I would have imagined, especially when the evil Satan-like character, who not everyone can see or hear is on screen.\n\nI'm delighted to see a plethora of faith-promoting cinema, and I think that's because so many of us believers are grasping onto whatever shreds of hope that still remain in our dark and dreary world, not to mention the financial success marketing to a faithful populace who thirsts and hungers for something worthy, something uplifting, something not vile, vulgar, gratuitous, or profane. For that reason alone, it's worth supporting.\n\nTo be shared a glimpse of what it might have been like to observe Christ from a different perspective than believers currently have has enough merit to provoke further questioning, which may motivate believers and non-believers alike to plunge yet again into the familiar text of the Holy Bible for what IS provided as scripture and sanctioned for distribution to the saints and the world at large, and that is always a good thing.\n\nAdditionally, I can't help myself in observing all the costumes, sets, casting, accents, props, behaviors, and such, because in a movie, it takes just seconds to see what the book may take pages and pages to describe in setting the period with complete authenticity. This movie eventually won me over in creating a period of time that was utterly believable with one exception, English accents from Britain. Uh, who said the Christ child had an English accent, hello? So, give this aspect a pass and enjoy the rest of what's good about this movie, because there is a lot to appreciate, despite that.\n\nThe physical setting of the film is positively perfect. It's just breathtaking as to how I imagine the accuracy of the day was. It's filmed in Italy, which I guessed when the credits rolled at the end before it said exactly where. Most of the credits are of local people who, naturally, have perfectly Italian last names. I didn't see one evidence of modern-day influence or slip-up, which is saying something. Whoever was in charge of that deserves some kind of award for transporting the viewer to 7 A. D. with no ripples! I really REALLY liked the character, Sarah, the old woman, who surprised and blessed the offending soldiers with food and wine and implored them to spare her family, which was just a brilliant strategy. I have no doubt such women existed and still exist to soften hearts of hardened men. Her weather-beaten look and those of other extras lent to the rawness of the time and harshness of the conditions of that day. They were just great. No sunscreen or night cream regimen for them. No pinking of their lips, no lip balm, and no blush on their cheeks.\n\nOther scenes along their path were sad to see, including the process of hoisting criminals up on crosses. The murdering of all the little boys was also depicted with splatters of blood and shadows, which gave me pause as to whether it would be appropriate for sensitive young viewers, it was pretty intense and scary.\n\nThe other scary role mentioned above was the demon I previously mentioned. He was quite deliciously frightening. His whispers to people who couldn't see him are something I believe is possible in our unseen but still real world. It was interesting that Jesus could see him, could hear him, but was unafraid of him in the least. It was also interesting that the demon didn't know who Jesus was, only that he was an "angel" boy and wanted to thwart his good deeds and influence others to do the same.\n\nThe fact that the film portrayed Christ performing miracles but still didn't know who He was or why He could was reminiscent of Harry Potter, who performed magic as a boy long before he knew he was a wizard. In reality, I prefer to think His mother Mary and Joseph, along with His Father in Heaven let Him know who He was, but I was not upset in any way how this portrayal was presented. We simply don't know, and that's the fun of this picture. It attempts to fill in the gaps the scriptures leave.\n\nThe caution would be to be sure to teach children that this is a work of pure fiction, because of the phenomenon uninformed viewers have of just believing things simply because they are shown in a film, another reason I detest the new "Noah", written with a wicked, intentional, history-revisionist's hand. I refuse to support such deplorable ambitions to distort, marginalize, and destroy real history through political agenda-driven films. This movie is not that. It's simply a suggestion of what may have happened. It offered me a little insight as to the reality of how dangerous it was for him, always being hunted. Joseph and Mary's characters were totally believable. Joseph is a stud for who he was and what he had to take on. Think of it, the scandal! I would have liked to see more of Joseph teaching Jesus how to be a carpenter, how they interacted while not being pursued.\n\nAs you can see, there is enough worth supporting about this film. I can't think of a reason to trash a film that attempts to promote faith, unless you're a faith hater. I just don't get that. Intent matters, and while making money is important to the solvency of a project, I don't believe that is the reason behind why this creative team put this out, not in the least. People who make films like these are part of the solution, not part of the problem, and God bless them for that!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3426,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-11","keywords":"israel,jesus christ character,1st century,messiah,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2382672665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjM4NDI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NjU4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjM4NDI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NjU4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Jesus Christ at age seven as he and his family depart Egypt to return home to Nazareth."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6026206/","name":"Adam Greaves-Neal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909906/","name":"Vincent Walsh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3322537/","name":"Sara Lazzaro"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637493/","name":"Cyrus Nowrasteh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043365/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232424/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637492/","name":"Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637493/","name":"Cyrus Nowrasteh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0723351/","name":"Anne Rice"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For that reason alone, it's worth supporting.\n\nTo be shared a glimpse of what it might have been like to observe Christ from a different perspective than believers currently have has enough merit to provoke further questioning, which may motivate believers and non-believers alike to plunge yet again into the familiar text of the Holy Bible for what IS provided as scripture and sanctioned for distribution to the saints and the world at large, and that is always a good thing.\n\nAdditionally, I can't help myself in observing all the costumes, sets, casting, accents, props, behaviors, and such, because in a movie, it takes just seconds to see what the book may take pages and pages to describe in setting the period with complete authenticity. This movie eventually won me over in creating a period of time that was utterly believable with one exception, English accents from Britain. Uh, who said the Christ child had an English accent, hello? So, give this aspect a pass and enjoy the rest of what's good about this movie, because there is a lot to appreciate, despite that.\n\nThe physical setting of the film is positively perfect. It's just breathtaking as to how I imagine the accuracy of the day was. It's filmed in Italy, which I guessed when the credits rolled at the end before it said exactly where. Most of the credits are of local people who, naturally, have perfectly Italian last names. I didn't see one evidence of modern-day influence or slip-up, which is saying something. Whoever was in charge of that deserves some kind of award for transporting the viewer to 7 A. D. with no ripples! I really REALLY liked the character, Sarah, the old woman, who surprised and blessed the offending soldiers with food and wine and implored them to spare her family, which was just a brilliant strategy. I have no doubt such women existed and still exist to soften hearts of hardened men. Her weather-beaten look and those of other extras lent to the rawness of the time and harshness of the conditions of that day. They were just great. No sunscreen or night cream regimen for them. No pinking of their lips, no lip balm, and no blush on their cheeks.\n\nOther scenes along their path were sad to see, including the process of hoisting criminals up on crosses. The murdering of all the little boys was also depicted with splatters of blood and shadows, which gave me pause as to whether it would be appropriate for sensitive young viewers, it was pretty intense and scary.\n\nThe other scary role mentioned above was the demon I previously mentioned. He was quite deliciously frightening. His whispers to people who couldn't see him are something I believe is possible in our unseen but still real world. It was interesting that Jesus could see him, could hear him, but was unafraid of him in the least. It was also interesting that the demon didn't know who Jesus was, only that he was an "angel" boy and wanted to thwart his good deeds and influence others to do the same.\n\nThe fact that the film portrayed Christ performing miracles but still didn't know who He was or why He could was reminiscent of Harry Potter, who performed magic as a boy long before he knew he was a wizard. In reality, I prefer to think His mother Mary and Joseph, along with His Father in Heaven let Him know who He was, but I was not upset in any way how this portrayal was presented. We simply don't know, and that's the fun of this picture. It attempts to fill in the gaps the scriptures leave.\n\nThe caution would be to be sure to teach children that this is a work of pure fiction, because of the phenomenon uninformed viewers have of just believing things simply because they are shown in a film, another reason I detest the new "Noah", written with a wicked, intentional, history-revisionist's hand. I refuse to support such deplorable ambitions to distort, marginalize, and destroy real history through political agenda-driven films. This movie is not that. It's simply a suggestion of what may have happened. It offered me a little insight as to the reality of how dangerous it was for him, always being hunted. Joseph and Mary's characters were totally believable. Joseph is a stud for who he was and what he had to take on. Think of it, the scandal! I would have liked to see more of Joseph teaching Jesus how to be a carpenter, how they interacted while not being pursued.\n\nAs you can see, there is enough worth supporting about this film. I can't think of a reason to trash a film that attempts to promote faith, unless you're a faith hater. I just don't get that. Intent matters, and while making money is important to the solvency of a project, I don't believe that is the reason behind why this creative team put this out, not in the least. People who make films like these are part of the solution, not part of the problem, and God bless them for that!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3426,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-11","keywords":"israel,jesus christ character,1st century,messiah,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2382672665","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjM4NDI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NjU4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjM4NDI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NjU4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Jesus Christ at age seven as he and his family depart Egypt to return home to Nazareth.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6026206/","name":"Adam Greaves-Neal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909906/","name":"Vincent Walsh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3322537/","name":"Sara Lazzaro"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637493/","name":"Cyrus Nowrasteh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043365/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232424/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637492/","name":"Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637493/","name":"Cyrus Nowrasteh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0723351/","name":"Anne Rice"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Trust me and watch this movie with all your sole, you have to listen and understand what is happening. This movie has beautiful scenes and amazing music, OMG the music just melts in you and you lives in there. Finally Saoirse Ronan just killed it, specially the way she tells the story, you are connected to the movie soon and enjoy watching it, I remember her play in "the lovely bones" she is more mature now and always she's been consistent and so talented actress.

Highly Recommended.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15328,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-08-26","keywords":"tamil,caretaker,france,sri lankan,janitor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2043853337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNkZjFkNjEtZWE2Ni00YTI2LWJmNjktYWRjZmIwNTA2MDM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNkZjFkNjEtZWE2Ni00YTI2LWJmNjktYWRjZmIwNTA2MDM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7316147/","name":"Jesuthasan Antonythasan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7316148/","name":"Kalieaswari Srinivasan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7316149/","name":"Claudine Vinasithamby"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049689/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0258767/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0081179/","name":"Thomas Bidegain","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4380548/","name":"Noé Debré"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is unpleasant superiority and it is mostly undeserved because to be honest this is a hard film to follow and it does demand attention. Those wishing to insult me via private message can do so, but I did struggle several times to understand how things fitted together and what relevance certain scenes had. This didn't limit my enjoyment of the film though and mostly I still followed the broad stroke of the plot, even if some bits of it did lose me.\n\nI've not read the tome of a book or seen the BBC mini-series, so I can't comment how well it compresses down to this two-hour film, but for me it did at times seem to be cramming a lot into a small time and occasionally it felt like it was unnecessarily convoluted or confusing. If you stay with it as best you can, it is intriguing and rather dramatic considering that much of the film is people talking to one another as opposed to chases and gun fights.

It is unpleasant superiority and it is mostly undeserved because to be honest this is a hard film to follow and it does demand attention. Those wishing to insult me via private message can do so, but I did struggle several times to understand how things fitted together and what relevance certain scenes had. This didn't limit my enjoyment of the film though and mostly I still followed the broad stroke of the plot, even if some bits of it did lose me.\n\nI've not read the tome of a book or seen the BBC mini-series, so I can't comment how well it compresses down to this two-hour film, but for me it did at times seem to be cramming a lot into a small time and occasionally it felt like it was unnecessarily convoluted or confusing. If you stay with it as best you can, it is intriguing and rather dramatic considering that much of the film is people talking to one another as opposed to chases and gun fights. The success of this is mostly down to the atmosphere and tone created by director Alfredson, because there is a constant tension to the film – cold perhaps, but very tense at times, certainly not bored even if it can look that way from a distance.\n\nThis is not what he does best though, because to there was an aspect to the film that was excellent and this was the feeling of outdatedness, of an unnecessary function and a pointless "war".

The story of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot is a very interesting part of history, something that was appreciated more by me once learning of the significance of the annual Bonfire Night.\n\n'Gunpowder' is not BBC at their best though. It is interesting enough and there are a lot of good elements here (far more so than has been credit for by some reviewers), but it could have been much more explosive than it actually turned out to be. The criticisms are understandable, though the purported anti-Catholicism and propaganda ones for my tastes have been blown out of proportion. \n\nStarting with the good things, the best thing about 'Gunpowder' is the production values. They are nothing short of splendid, especially the sumptuous costumes and atmospheric scenery/set design that actually give the feel of the viewer being transported to the early 17th century and being there as unseen observers. The music doesn't intrude but has presence and atmosphere. \n\nParts of the script do intrigue and provoke thought and the storytelling does have compelling and suspenseful moments. The violence and executions are harrowing and are not for the faint hearted, but that would have been the case at the time because executions were brutal then, even more so than depicted.\n\nMostly the acting is fine, especially from charismatic Tom Cullen, dignified Liv Tyler (who is not as out of place as one would think) and Shaun Dooley enjoying himself. \n\nKit Harrington and Mark Gatiss are a little more uneven but do have impressive moments. Harrington is a little flat at first but once the character grows so does his acting to something more brooding. Gatiss is too cartoonish in places, but at other times he is quite creepy.\n\nHowever, the script does feel underdeveloped and tonally unbalanced, both too bland and too broad. It also too talky, Episode 2 especially is too heavy in talk and rambles, and it does affect the pacing which can be dull. \n\nCharacterisation is also not as rich as it could have been, too many of the characters are too one-dimensional and one doesn't really get to know them. The storytelling has some harrowing, exciting and suspenseful moments, but they could have come more consistently, the tone could have been more balanced and even and the pace and script could have been far tighter.

The story of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot is a very interesting part of history, something that was appreciated more by me once learning of the significance of the annual Bonfire Night.\n\n'Gunpowder' is not BBC at their best though. It is interesting enough and there are a lot of good elements here (far more so than has been credit for by some reviewers), but it could have been much more explosive than it actually turned out to be. The criticisms are understandable, though the purported anti-Catholicism and propaganda ones for my tastes have been blown out of proportion. \n\nStarting with the good things, the best thing about 'Gunpowder' is the production values. They are nothing short of splendid, especially the sumptuous costumes and atmospheric scenery/set design that actually give the feel of the viewer being transported to the early 17th century and being there as unseen observers. The music doesn't intrude but has presence and atmosphere. \n\nParts of the script do intrigue and provoke thought and the storytelling does have compelling and suspenseful moments. The violence and executions are harrowing and are not for the faint hearted, but that would have been the case at the time because executions were brutal then, even more so than depicted.\n\nMostly the acting is fine, especially from charismatic Tom Cullen, dignified Liv Tyler (who is not as out of place as one would think) and Shaun Dooley enjoying himself. \n\nKit Harrington and Mark Gatiss are a little more uneven but do have impressive moments. Harrington is a little flat at first but once the character grows so does his acting to something more brooding. Gatiss is too cartoonish in places, but at other times he is quite creepy.\n\nHowever, the script does feel underdeveloped and tonally unbalanced, both too bland and too broad. It also too talky, Episode 2 especially is too heavy in talk and rambles, and it does affect the pacing which can be dull. \n\nCharacterisation is also not as rich as it could have been, too many of the characters are too one-dimensional and one doesn't really get to know them. The storytelling has some harrowing, exciting and suspenseful moments, but they could have come more consistently, the tone could have been more balanced and even and the pace and script could have been far tighter.

The feeling is very much the same as wanting another tour in a gallery of paintings of old Dutch masters, to enjoy repeatedly the beauty of light and shadow and colours.

I can't think of a single performer that impressed me - even Monae let me down this time.\n\nThe first 1/2 hour was strong but then it completely degenerated. The twist was interesting and probably the only thing of note that I took away from the viewing.

And Moe Berg remained a mystery until he died. Here's food for thought: when you think of Jews in baseball Moe Berg's name doesn't easily come to mind. Hank Grrenberg, yes. Sandy Kofax, for sure. Not Moe Berg who played for the Boston Red Sox during the 20s and the 30s.  'The Catcher was a Spy' is a conventional film with a fascinating 'hero': a polyglot, a polymath, born of Eastern Europeans Jews who settled in Harlem.  And yet, Berg, played by a charming Paul Rudd who like his character celebrates tight lip secrecy. It is to Rudd's credit to have learned smatterings of six or seven languages to give body to his character who know many, many more.  Berg graduated summa laude from Princeton when few Jews could attend. A lawyer from Columbia law who passed the bar before he finished his degree. Yet baseball was his life as was spying. The script writers give short shift to the spy Berg when he went to Japan with an all-star team that included Babe Ruth. We get the idea Berg dresses up as a Japanese in full kimono, armed with a camera films from the roof of a hospital Tokyo Harbor which had a dual use as a military facility. It would have taken too much to explain the prewar politics and the role of Japan invading Manchuria, testing America's and European empires' turf in Asia. So, although Berg was acting on behalf of a rudimentary US spy agency, Lewin's script white washes it as an act of a patriot. There is a 'love' story, but beneath the surface the film there is a flaw, a 'moral flaw' for the time. Was Berg queer? Probably. A scene of a night visit to the waterfront frequented by men, and non reputable bars frequented soley by men. Now to the film: Wild Bill Donovan, founder of the OSS, predecessor to the CIA, recruits Berg after Pearl Harbor. Donovan asks him if he's queer. And without a beat, Rudd replies, 'I know how to keep secrets'; to which Donovan replies, I don't care wo a man f--ks, I'm only interested if he's wants us to win the war'. Berg's assignment is to kill Werner Heisenberg, father of the German nuclear bomb. And here the film takes wings...and a high moment of the 'Catcher was a Spy' is when Rudd and Strong play mental chess, to fathom have the Germans the bomb. And here we see Berg has a dialectical frame of mind, he's willing to spare Heisenberg for an answer that Germany's nuclear project is not very advanced. (Heisenberg is the object of an award winning play "Copenhagen' that infers Heisenberg purposefully delayed Hitler's plans for a nuclear weapon.)  The camera turns all over the place Japan, Italy, New York and Switzerland. Long shots, close shots, it runs the full alphabet of film making.  Rudd speaks his languages fairly well with a good accent, but slips briefly when it comes to French. There is nothing dramatically wrong, but the film never plumbs the secretive Moe Berg. At the end we are told Berg never married and spent time in libraries. And yet he never left the CIAin mind and spirit and died the loner he was.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8951,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2018-06-22","keywords":"espionage,spy,baseball,baseball player,boston red sox","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2587998233","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5N2JmYmMtNzQzNy00N2E5LWJhZjktMDQ5YmFmYjI4ZDE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5N2JmYmMtNzQzNy00N2E5LWJhZjktMDQ5YmFmYjI4ZDE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Catcher Was a Spy tells the true story of Morris "Moe" Berg (Paul Rudd), the Major League Baseball player, Ivy League graduate, attorney and top-secret spy who helped the U.S. defeat Nazi Germany in the race to build the atomic bomb."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0269419/","name":"Pierfrancesco Favino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0929489/","name":"Tom Wilkinson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506802/","name":"Ben Lewin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092860/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0240363/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7260546/","name":"Nicholas Dawidoff"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I get that he is a PI but I hope nobody has ever needed to look into the distance so many times in 2 hours.\n\nI think it's also generally inconsistent, revelling in what I imagine were seen as character development and setting the seen comes across as predictable.

It's just the right time to watch a movie like "Mossad" written and directed by Alon Gur Arye, a parody in the genre of the "Naked Gun" series that combined comedy and espionage made in the 1990s by the American ZAZ trio (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker), or of the British films that had as a hero Johnny English (played by Rowan Atkinson), back on screen last year. I saw the movie yesterday evening at its first or second public screening, before the official premiere, in a cinema hall that was full with an audience that reacted enthusiastically. I can bet that a new Israeli cult comedy is about to be born, and that Britain's secret agent Johnny English has now a serious Israeli rival in the secret agent Guy Moran (interpreted by Tsahi Halevi), equally ready to save the world risking to destroy it ten times.\n\nThe satirical arrows in this cinematic parody genre are usually directed towards two main directions - a "serious" theme from an area of activity with visibility and of major interest for the public (in this case the fight against terrorism and the secret wars led by the national spy organizations - Mossad, CIA) and the 'serious' movies related to this theme (here the action films and series such as 'James Bond', 'Mission Impossible', etc.). In order to succeed, such films should avoid dealing with any of the 'sacred cows' and should include as many jokes as possible with references to known realities or famous films, all packed in a story which aims to be coherent but is explicitly not taken too seriously. I think the screenwriter and director Alon Gur Arye has very honorably succeeded to meet these conditions and the result is a fun and engaging movie.\n\nThe pace of jokes and comic situations is considerable and these are present from the first frame before the generic to the last one at the final credits. I'm not convinced that everything will pass the screen to the international audiences, and as the screening had English subtitles I noticed that some adaptations are being attempted. The level of satire and critical humor dealing with the bombastic myths, local bureaucracy, or typology of secret war heroes did not seem to me to fall under anything else in the genre, the latest 'Johnny English', for example. I can say the same thing about the level of acting - Dvir Benedek and Tsahi Halevi are excellent in the key roles, the feminine presences are attractive and expressive, Tal Friedman creates an original role that makes us forget his appearances in popular comic television programs, and the Israeli screen and stage veterans Gila Almador and Ilan Dar act in the movie with obvious pleasure. They all have fun and make us have fun. The less successful parts of this film are related to the coherence of the action (there is no moment of real suspense) and the special effects that have suffered from a clear lack of funds, with results visible today in the era of spectacular graphic effects. These details cannot spoil too much of the pleasure I had watching "Mossad", which has good chances to be the summer blockbuster in Israel, and to be successful elsewhere and beyond its first season of screening.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":597,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-06-27","keywords":"parody,mossad,israel,airplane,reference to naked gun","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"MOSSAD!

Specifically he is tasked with using the Turing test on her to establish if her AI is sufficiently convincing to pass as human.\n\nDespite contributing several scripts for the screen, this is writer Alex Garland's first directorial effort. It's a hard sci-fi movie which examines concepts and ideas above everything else. That's not to say it isn't dramatic or even thrilling because it is both of those things as well but the focus is squarely on the science fiction speculation, and this is a very welcome thing. The central concept that it examines is artificial intelligence. How we interact with AI as humans, as well as how a seductive machine could in turn manipulate us. The very well written script poses philosophical questions such as is there moral or immoral ways to treat AI. It also considers if sometimes part of being human is that we sometimes subconsciously want to be fooled by an illusion, if it is attractive enough.\n\nIn many ways Ex Machina resembles last years Under the Skin. Both feature highly advanced female non-humans. In the earlier film Scarlett Johansson played an alien, here Alicia Vikander plays an android. While the very small cast all acquit themselves very well, it is Vikander who stands out in the film's most challenging role. It's a nuanced performance that captures the fine balance between the human-like and machine. Not only this but the marvellous special effects compliment this performance to create a very distinctive character. Aside from the effects, this is probably quite a modestly budgeted film, as the small little-known cast and limited sets suggest. But these restrictions have been used to the films advantage, as the unknown cast surprise more given little is known of them and the restricted setting gives off a claustrophobic feel which works well, while forcing us to focus in even more on the ideas being put in front of us. A scene setting ambient soundtrack additionally creates just the right off-kilter mood to accentuate the events. But it's ultimately the very good writing that underpins the success of this film. All-in-all, very impressive science fiction for those who appreciate the genre's more cerebral side.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":505713,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-01-21","keywords":"artificial intelligence,turing test,minimal cast,robot,robot human relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi744337689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young programmer is selected to participate in a breakthrough experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breathtaking female A.I.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2539953/","name":"Alicia Vikander"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1727304/","name":"Domhnall Gleeson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390816/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Specifically he is tasked with using the Turing test on her to establish if her AI is sufficiently convincing to pass as human.\n\nDespite contributing several scripts for the screen, this is writer Alex Garland's first directorial effort. It's a hard sci-fi movie which examines concepts and ideas above everything else. That's not to say it isn't dramatic or even thrilling because it is both of those things as well but the focus is squarely on the science fiction speculation, and this is a very welcome thing. The central concept that it examines is artificial intelligence. How we interact with AI as humans, as well as how a seductive machine could in turn manipulate us. The very well written script poses philosophical questions such as is there moral or immoral ways to treat AI. It also considers if sometimes part of being human is that we sometimes subconsciously want to be fooled by an illusion, if it is attractive enough.\n\nIn many ways Ex Machina resembles last years Under the Skin. Both feature highly advanced female non-humans. In the earlier film Scarlett Johansson played an alien, here Alicia Vikander plays an android. While the very small cast all acquit themselves very well, it is Vikander who stands out in the film's most challenging role.

As the movie opens, it is "2007" and an Asian-American girl named Dorothy is getting ready for work at a strip club. Then a Latina woman named Ramona makes her grand entrance and does a spectacular pole dance as Fiona Apple's "Criminal" blasts from the speakers. Duly impressed, Dorothy reaches out to Ramona for some dancing tips, and the two hit it off. We then go to "2014" where we see Dorothy being interviewed by a journalist... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Lorene Scafaria, whose "Seeking a Friend For the End of the World" some years ago was one of my favorite movies of that year. Here she takes a New York magazine article and turns it into a wild, wild movie. Beware: not much is left to the imagination. The grand entrance of Jennifer Lopez in that opening scene's pole dance is nothing short of stunning. In fact, the same can be said about Lopez's overall performance, which should be Oscar nomination-worthy, and certainly is a career-best performance. Lopez turned 50 this year, and looks about 35. She takes control of the movie, and requests, makes that demands, your attention. You are more than happy to give it to her. Constance Wu, Keke Palmer, and Lili Reinhardt round out the primary performers. Check out Cardi B and Lizzo (part of the strip gang). When a movie's principal set is a strip club, you can expect a lot of fist-pumping music, and the movie more than delivers on that level. In addition to the aforementioned Fiona, there are songs from Britney Spears, Janet Jackson ("Control", of course), Fat Joe, Queen She, 50 Cent, and many, many more.\n\n"Hustlers" premiered a few weeks ago at the Toronto International Film Festival to immediate acclaim, and was released wide last weekend (outperforming expectations at the box office). The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati in its second weekend of release was attended very nicely (a good 30 people in a small room). If you have an interest in seeing a gritty yet funny stripper drama starring an Oscar nomination-worthy Jennifer Lopez, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":91480,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-13","keywords":"female nudity,strip club,materialism,seduction,lap dance","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2881470233","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJiZGIxN2YtODc0MS00NGM4LThkZWQtOWQ4MzA3MTFjNzAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJiZGIxN2YtODc0MS00NGM4LThkZWQtOWQ4MzA3MTFjNzAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the viral New York Magazine article, Hustlers follows a crew of savvy former strip club employees who band together to turn the tables on their Wall Street clients."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2090422/","name":"Constance Wu"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000182/","name":"Jennifer Lopez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005466/","name":"Julia Stiles"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1032521/","name":"Lorene Scafaria"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323215/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0471026/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021149/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1032521/","name":"Lorene Scafaria"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5658722/","name":"Jessica Pressler"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

With some of the most realistic fight scenes for a '60s movie and terrific story by Fleming, this film has a recipe for a masterpiece.\n\nAs mentioned in my review of "Dr. No", his charm and intellectual wit is still there, and then in some scenes in a whole lot more better than before. How he tries to commence his mission, you just couldn't fall asleep. A-grade acting by Connery here.\n\nThen-newcomer Daniela Branchi is good as Bond Girl Tatiana, who is the wrong girl at the right time. Desmond Llewelyn, in his debut as gadget man Q, shows us an impressive array of gadgets that Bond would later find quite useful. But it is Robert Shaw, who almost steals the show as the murderous, merciless, assassin Grant, who will stop at nothing to prevent Bond and Tatiana from commencing their mission.\n\nCrew also return here. Producers Brocolli and Saltzman and director Young have returned, with double the budget and double the thrills in return. Also, the musical score by John Barry is memorable, it really sets the tone for a realistic spy adventure.\n\nThe story is not meant to be an action picture. It is more like the adventures of a spy, with the dangers of being a spy. In short, it is a complex spy thriller, made to suit the target audience which are spy fans and intelligent viewers. I do not understand how anyone could call such a film "boring." This truly is a pinnacle of the James Bond series, one which will remain for years to come.\n\n9.34/10\n\nDelton","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":127012,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1963-10-25","keywords":"british secret service,official bond film,bond girl,james bond character,007","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"These Bond Women Are Changing the Spy Game","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3772365849","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzI0Yjg1NTEtNDk3Zi00MzljLTk5Y2MtNmYwYWNlMTViYzVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzI0Yjg1NTEtNDk3Zi00MzljLTk5Y2MtNmYwYWNlMTViYzVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief, presented by Progressive, let's look at the evolution of the women who loved the spy, and hear from four who co-star with Daniel Craig in Bond 25."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001727/","name":"Robert Shaw"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0502322/","name":"Lotte Lenya"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0950109/","name":"Terence Young"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367820/","name":"Johanna Harwood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

With some of the most realistic fight scenes for a '60s movie and terrific story by Fleming, this film has a recipe for a masterpiece.\n\nAs mentioned in my review of "Dr. No", his charm and intellectual wit is still there, and then in some scenes in a whole lot more better than before. How he tries to commence his mission, you just couldn't fall asleep. A-grade acting by Connery here.\n\nThen-newcomer Daniela Branchi is good as Bond Girl Tatiana, who is the wrong girl at the right time. Desmond Llewelyn, in his debut as gadget man Q, shows us an impressive array of gadgets that Bond would later find quite useful. But it is Robert Shaw, who almost steals the show as the murderous, merciless, assassin Grant, who will stop at nothing to prevent Bond and Tatiana from commencing their mission.\n\nCrew also return here. Producers Brocolli and Saltzman and director Young have returned, with double the budget and double the thrills in return. Also, the musical score by John Barry is memorable, it really sets the tone for a realistic spy adventure.\n\nThe story is not meant to be an action picture. It is more like the adventures of a spy, with the dangers of being a spy. In short, it is a complex spy thriller, made to suit the target audience which are spy fans and intelligent viewers. I do not understand how anyone could call such a film "boring." This truly is a pinnacle of the James Bond series, one which will remain for years to come.\n\n9.34/10\n\nDelton","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":127012,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1963-10-25","keywords":"british secret service,official bond film,bond girl,james bond character,007","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"These Bond Women Are Changing the Spy Game","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3772365849","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzI0Yjg1NTEtNDk3Zi00MzljLTk5Y2MtNmYwYWNlMTViYzVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzI0Yjg1NTEtNDk3Zi00MzljLTk5Y2MtNmYwYWNlMTViYzVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief, presented by Progressive, let's look at the evolution of the women who loved the spy, and hear from four who co-star with Daniel Craig in Bond 25.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001727/","name":"Robert Shaw","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0502322/","name":"Lotte Lenya"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0950109/","name":"Terence Young"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367820/","name":"Johanna Harwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

One its people, an old woman, preserving the memory of his late husband, being happy when her daughter and granddaughter visits her, having need of a little pig in a sort of version of Pig story by Ion Creanga , punishing the killers of her granddaughter in a manner remembering The Virgin Spring by Ingmar Bergman , having the chance than a rich man being very generous with her. A film about Russia more than about a venerable woman. Beautiful in a sense than only by the Easterns can be understand, maybe defined. A story with mythical embroideries about lonely life, survive, injustice and a form of profound peace. Maybe, an useful testimony. Sure, a beautiful film.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-03-26","keywords":"loyalty","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11400286/","name":"Valeri Maslov","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11400285/","name":"Evgenija Molotova","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3756556/","name":"Inna Stepanova"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0713689/","name":"Yusup Razykov"],"creator":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0713689/","name":"Yusup Razykov"],"duration":"PT1H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was "For Your Eyes Only" with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt, "Goldfinger" is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.\n\nBefore I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films, i.e. before I'd seen them, a good friend and cartooning mentor, Ross Paperman, sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray: fear. Not a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. "Do you expect me to talk?" "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.\n\nPerhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don't even appear to be trying anymore.\n\nBut it's more than that. Even watching "Goldfinger" today, having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer, it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about "Goldfinger". How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience. The story, the characters and the fun of "Goldfinger" is timeless and if given a chance could probably rope in a whole new generation of fans. It just doesn't seem likely to happen.\n\nMuch of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially "Goldfinger" and "Dr. No", proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.\n\nBut if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen "Goldfinger" yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond. You'll probably be hooked by the time you hear Shirley Bassey's voice in the famous opening theme.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1964-09-20","keywords":"official james bond series,gold,aston martin,race against time,british secret service","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Goldfinger","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2383218457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Goldfinger"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002085/","name":"Gert Fröbe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000303/","name":"Honor Blackman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214989/","name":"Paul Dehn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was "For Your Eyes Only" with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt, "Goldfinger" is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.\n\nBefore I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films, i.e. before I'd seen them, a good friend and cartooning mentor, Ross Paperman, sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray: fear. Not a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. "Do you expect me to talk?" "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.\n\nPerhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don't even appear to be trying anymore.\n\nBut it's more than that. Even watching "Goldfinger" today, having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer, it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about "Goldfinger". How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience. The story, the characters and the fun of "Goldfinger" is timeless and if given a chance could probably rope in a whole new generation of fans. It just doesn't seem likely to happen.\n\nMuch of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially "Goldfinger" and "Dr. No", proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.\n\nBut if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen "Goldfinger" yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond. You'll probably be hooked by the time you hear Shirley Bassey's voice in the famous opening theme.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1964-09-20","keywords":"official james bond series,gold,aston martin,race against time,british secret service","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Goldfinger","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2383218457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Goldfinger"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002085/","name":"Gert Fröbe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000303/","name":"Honor Blackman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214989/","name":"Paul Dehn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As this is a British movie, it was a very smart marketing idea to have a famous American actor, George Peppard, and a famous Italian actress, Sophia Loren, co-star in it. This way they could say "Starring (insert famous British actor name here)" when marketed in Britain, and advertise it as "Starring George Peppard" and "Starring Sophia Loren", when marketed in the U.S.A.and Italy respectively. This gives the makers of the film a much larger audience than just Britain. George Peppard and Sophia Loren have significant roles, but are not the stars of the movie. Details like portraying Hanna Reitsch and having accurate, and very good special effects make this far better than most World War II movies. Especially since most of the stars of the movie don't survive. If you enjoy historical accuracy, a well thought-out plot, and the unexpected, then I think you will find this movie a top-notch production and well worth watching. Without spoiling the ending, I will tell you though that the Gemans did not win the war.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4604,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1965-08-30","keywords":"rocket,v2,spy thriller,british,world war two","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000047/","name":"Sophia Loren"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000577/","name":"George Peppard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002145/","name":"Trevor Howard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0027183/","name":"Michael Anderson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071784/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0171385/","name":"Duilio Coletti"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0678008/","name":"Vittoriano Petrilli"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0696247/","name":"Emeric Pressburger"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As this is a British movie, it was a very smart marketing idea to have a famous American actor, George Peppard, and a famous Italian actress, Sophia Loren, co-star in it. This way they could say "Starring (insert famous British actor name here)" when marketed in Britain, and advertise it as "Starring George Peppard" and "Starring Sophia Loren", when marketed in the U.S.A.and Italy respectively. This gives the makers of the film a much larger audience than just Britain. George Peppard and Sophia Loren have significant roles, but are not the stars of the movie. Details like portraying Hanna Reitsch and having accurate, and very good special effects make this far better than most World War II movies. Especially since most of the stars of the movie don't survive. If you enjoy historical accuracy, a well thought-out plot, and the unexpected, then I think you will find this movie a top-notch production and well worth watching. Without spoiling the ending, I will tell you though that the Gemans did not win the war.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4604,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1965-08-30","keywords":"rocket,v2,spy thriller,british,world war two","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000047/","name":"Sophia Loren","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000577/","name":"George Peppard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002145/","name":"Trevor Howard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0027183/","name":"Michael Anderson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071784/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0171385/","name":"Duilio Coletti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0678008/","name":"Vittoriano Petrilli","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0696247/","name":"Emeric Pressburger"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

 --- Description: Vienna Blood: Created by Steve Thompson. With Matthew Beard, Jürgen Maurer, Charlene McKenna, Conleth Hill.

It's more of a team player effort. Of course, Both main characters, Lieberman and the inspector, have to come together from very diametrical positions of how a case should be solved. The term of 'profiler' is used, and I'm quite sure that's for the audience only, and wasn't known then. But they may have had a similiar name for a killer's extrapolated personality. Acting is really very good, and Mathew Beard is just optimal for Liebermann, exploring new methods of deduction and investigation. Very high production values, meticulously catching the flair of the young 20th century during the short time when Vienna was the capital of a huge empire, where the Jews tried to find their place by assimilating themselves. There is always some dry humor present, which makes the show a very pleasant watch. Directing by Robert Dornhelm in the first episode is great. Tension is built very well until the case is solved in a nice finale. Of course Vienna is the third main Character, as it is shown in most of it's remaining Glory from the old days. There are some small references to the famous 'Third Man', or I thought to recognise them. In this first episode most of the secondary characters did not get much attention, but I hope this will change in later episodes. I hope the coming episodes are equally high in quality to the first one.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3336,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-11-18","keywords":"fin de siecle,austria,vienna austria,police detective,vienna police department","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0063914/","name":"Matthew Beard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0561029/","name":"Jürgen Maurer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1800670/","name":"Charlene McKenna"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104998/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0115148/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078814/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1839162/","name":"Steve Thompson"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer - Season 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1751432729","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMxMWI2ZDUtYzdkNi00NDc3LWExNDEtNmFkNjVlOTA1NDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMxMWI2ZDUtYzdkNi00NDc3LWExNDEtNmFkNjVlOTA1NDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Max Liebermann, a student of Sigmund Freud, helps Detective Rheinhardt in the investigation of a series of disturbing murders around the grand cafes and opera houses of 1900s Vienna."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A well performed, touching and interesting show caught my eye. The characters are involving, are worth caring about and have a strong sense of purpose. Each one brings something to the mix and adds their own skills to the events of each episode. Each episode has a strong mystery to be solved, sometimes offering an intriguing moral dilemma to both Murdoch and the viewer.

In fact, I truly believe that it is a small jewel and aspiring cult movie. The setting is surprisingly good, the script, based on a book by Guy Lyon Playfair (one of the Enfield investigators), is magnificent. It does not abuse of any special effects, and it does back to the typical horror- suspense movies of the 70's and 80's like "The Changeling" type. Now that all horror films are gore or a collection of special effects, that is thankful. In addition, the script is full of subtle comic moments, surreal even, perfectly matched with the suspense of the film, that far from falling into the "Scary Movie" manners, what it does is humanize the characters, make them closer to the viewer and endow them with a certain psychological depth; help to this the great performances (along with the great script), of practically all the actors and actresses of this, in my opinion, small great work of art. The girl who plays Janet (Eleanor Worthington Cox) and the actor who plays Grosse (Timothy Spall) are immeasurable, great. The background of the work transcends the simple entertainment cinema (which is, but with quality), and penetrates into areas such as the importance of attachment in relationships, love, youth and adolescence, the importance of family, etc ... Simply great, hopefully this type of cinema more personal (even if it is in the fantastic-terror terrain) popularizes and more works are done as well as this. It is not necessary to spend a million- euro in special effects in a movie so that it can turn out (this film is proof of it), in fact this film gains credibility by using the just and the just, sometimes very handmade. A film conceived for TV, very good and highly recommended!.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4488,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Drama","Horror"],"datePublished":"2015-05-03","keywords":"tv mini series,1970s,psychotronic series,based on true story","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001758/","name":"Timothy Spall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5732956/","name":"Eleanor Worthington-Cox","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0828980/","name":"Juliet Stevenson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197929/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Enfield Haunting","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi703642905","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFmZTdlZTQtZGEzOC00OTdiLTkxZGItYmQxMTA1OTliZjVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFmZTdlZTQtZGEzOC00OTdiLTkxZGItYmQxMTA1OTliZjVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Enfield Haunting"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Setting the series in Ballarat rather than Melbourne also allows it to have the feel of a small town environment that the Aussies seem to love to do.

Setting the series in Ballarat rather than Melbourne also allows it to have the feel of a small town environment that the Aussies seem to love to do. Think of 'Blue Heelers', 'A Country Practice' or (dare I mention them) some of their soaps. As with most Australian dramas there is an underlying positiveness - despite the traumatic past that the characters might have had.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4050,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2013-02-01","keywords":"doctor","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307739/","name":"Nadine Garner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572112/","name":"Craig McLachlan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0184083/","name":"Charlie Cousins"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0392993/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0010984/","name":"George Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131770/","name":"Tony Wright"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3801727257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc4MmFiZGUtZDllYy00ZjRkLWE5NDEtNTE2YTkzMGIwYjI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc4MmFiZGUtZDllYy00ZjRkLWE5NDEtNTE2YTkzMGIwYjI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Furthermore, often people give bad marks just because they don't like an actor or director, which is unfortunate. This show is flat out one of the best I have ever seen.

As long as the action sequences are well made that is. "xXx: State of the Union" is a fair try in the genre but ultimately falls short.\n\nThe plot is as ridiculous as in the first movie. The NSA-agent Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) is once again looking in weird places trying to find a new agent that can break the rules and succeed. This time he finds Darius Stone (Ice Cube) in a military prison. Stone is an ex Navy Seal who will help Gibbons fight off a rogue part of the US Military trying to dispose of the president.\n\nSeriously, no one watches these movies for the plot anyway. So that the plot is ridiculous and cheesy is beside the point. No one watches this for the acting either. So that Ice Cube is not as much an actor as a walking scowl is ALSO beside the point. He does about as good a job as Vin Diesel did anyway. What is NOT beside the point though is the fact that "xXx: State of the Union" employs the same method of action filming as many other Hollywood-movies of late. You know the method: "move the camera exceptionally close and shake it like if the camera-man was a spastic". I know that this is to hide the fact that Ice Cube doesn't know how to fight. Still it's incredibly irritating! Also the lack of logic is too evident at times. Like Ice Cube driving a sports car 360km/h on a train track with his tires torn off... Seriously.\n\nOtherwise this had some potential. The technical quality is great, the movie looks really expensive. It has a lot of fun gadgets and crappy one-liners. And the speed of this movie is absolutely insane. Right from the beginning Lee Tamahori steps on it without ever looking back. So even though i can't say i really enjoyed this movie it was never boring, there is always something happening on screen. But the flaws in mostly the action department as well as the complete lack of logic disturbs the experience. It's still a lot better than the first movie though. I found the first one to be complete garbage, while this is still at least somewhat entertaining at times.\n\nSo in the end i think this "James Bond on steroids" will probably attract a lot of 15-yearolds that like when things keep moving and lights keep flashing. People who like to see a plot and at least some traces of logic might want to stay away though. It could have been the brainless action movie of the year, but it desperately needs some better action-directing for that.

The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian.

Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman, Nicolette Sheridan, and James Denton create the most bizarre and un believably satirical world of Wisteria Lane, a beautiful neighborhood with beautiful woman, each lives the perfect life...on the outside! Matching "American Beauty" with "Melrose Place", this fresh, raunchy, and intelligent show revolves around four women who begin uncovering a series of mysteries when their best friend commits suicide. Susan Mayer(Teri Hatcher) is a Striking, chirpy woman with a beautiful daughter and a great romance with Mike Delfino(James Denton), but her flaw of natural klutziness gets her in trouble. Hatcher is irresistibly funny, and brings hysterics to the screen. Bree Van De Camp(Marcia Cross) is the stereotypical "Stepford" wife who brings jealousy to the most sweetest of ladies with her perfect life, blue flowers, smart kids, and exceptional marriage...RIGHT! Her life consists of struggling to retain her marriage, or lack there of. Her children hate her most of the time, and her husband can't stand her perfection. Cross is remarkably powerful in performance, and displays witty charm, and howlingly hilarious reactions to the events surrounding her. Not to mention being gorgeous beyond belief! Lynette Scavo(Felicity Huffman) gets the most sympathy from us as the successful woman, on her way to becoming the most powerful woman in business, and then pregnancy after pregnancy takes it all away. Now, she struggles with the most out-of-control children in television history, and a husband who just doesn't get it, or any thing else! Huffman is exceptional in this role, and deserves the recognition for her efforts. She gains so much sympathy when she breaks on children's medication, Lynette is one most people would love to sit and "bitch" with, I know I would. Next is Gabrielle Solis(Eva Longoria), the perfect woman, the rich marriage the most dreaming life of the block...AS IF! She sleeps with teens, and worms her way in and out of situations both good and bad, but she has her funny moments. Longoria is predictably slutty temptress, with minor qualities to redeem, so far. With a little learning for Gabrielle, we might see more than pretty faces with Mrs. Solis, but Longoria is alright. Last, but NEVER least, is Edie Britt(Nicolette Sheridan), a man-hungry woman with a wip and handcuffs! She will walk all over you to get to your man! Watch out for Edie! Sheridan is just right for this caustic, little sexy villainess of the street. Yes, all the women shine in their glory of the show! Better than anything else on TV right now, and probably in the future, "Desperate Housewives" will satisfy to the very touch of perfection, and beyond!

Her life consists of struggling to retain her marriage, or lack there of. Her children hate her most of the time, and her husband can't stand her perfection. Cross is remarkably powerful in performance, and displays witty charm, and howlingly hilarious reactions to the events surrounding her. Not to mention being gorgeous beyond belief! Lynette Scavo(Felicity Huffman) gets the most sympathy from us as the successful woman, on her way to becoming the most powerful woman in business, and then pregnancy after pregnancy takes it all away. Now, she struggles with the most out-of-control children in television history, and a husband who just doesn't get it, or any thing else! Huffman is exceptional in this role, and deserves the recognition for her efforts. She gains so much sympathy when she breaks on children's medication, Lynette is one most people would love to sit and "bitch" with, I know I would. Next is Gabrielle Solis(Eva Longoria), the perfect woman, the rich marriage the most dreaming life of the block...AS IF! She sleeps with teens, and worms her way in and out of situations both good and bad, but she has her funny moments. Longoria is predictably slutty temptress, with minor qualities to redeem, so far. With a little learning for Gabrielle, we might see more than pretty faces with Mrs. Solis, but Longoria is alright. Last, but NEVER least, is Edie Britt(Nicolette Sheridan), a man-hungry woman with a wip and handcuffs! She will walk all over you to get to your man! Watch out for Edie! Sheridan is just right for this caustic, little sexy villainess of the street. Yes, all the women shine in their glory of the show! Better than anything else on TV right now, and probably in the future, "Desperate Housewives" will satisfy to the very touch of perfection, and beyond! Marc Cherry has created a masterpiece with this one! Thank the almighty for this one coming to the TV screen! May we be blessed with this show for many, many years to come!!!!!

Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman, Nicolette Sheridan, and James Denton create the most bizarre and un believably satirical world of Wisteria Lane, a beautiful neighborhood with beautiful woman, each lives the perfect life...on the outside! Matching "American Beauty" with "Melrose Place", this fresh, raunchy, and intelligent show revolves around four women who begin uncovering a series of mysteries when their best friend commits suicide.

The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian. However, it's very well done--good writing, great acting, and well directed. \n\nSandra Oh stands out for her comic timing, but the entire cast is superb.

Matching "American Beauty" with "Melrose Place", this fresh, raunchy, and intelligent show revolves around four women who begin uncovering a series of mysteries when their best friend commits suicide. Susan Mayer(Teri Hatcher) is a Striking, chirpy woman with a beautiful daughter and a great romance with Mike Delfino(James Denton), but her flaw of natural klutziness gets her in trouble. Hatcher is irresistibly funny, and brings hysterics to the screen. Bree Van De Camp(Marcia Cross) is the stereotypical "Stepford" wife who brings jealousy to the most sweetest of ladies with her perfect life, blue flowers, smart kids, and exceptional marriage...RIGHT! Her life consists of struggling to retain her marriage, or lack there of. Her children hate her most of the time, and her husband can't stand her perfection. Cross is remarkably powerful in performance, and displays witty charm, and howlingly hilarious reactions to the events surrounding her. Not to mention being gorgeous beyond belief! Lynette Scavo(Felicity Huffman) gets the most sympathy from us as the successful woman, on her way to becoming the most powerful woman in business, and then pregnancy after pregnancy takes it all away. Now, she struggles with the most out-of-control children in television history, and a husband who just doesn't get it, or any thing else! Huffman is exceptional in this role, and deserves the recognition for her efforts. She gains so much sympathy when she breaks on children's medication, Lynette is one most people would love to sit and "bitch" with, I know I would. Next is Gabrielle Solis(Eva Longoria), the perfect woman, the rich marriage the most dreaming life of the block...AS IF! She sleeps with teens, and worms her way in and out of situations both good and bad, but she has her funny moments. Longoria is predictably slutty temptress, with minor qualities to redeem, so far. With a little learning for Gabrielle, we might see more than pretty faces with Mrs. Solis, but Longoria is alright. Last, but NEVER least, is Edie Britt(Nicolette Sheridan), a man-hungry woman with a wip and handcuffs! She will walk all over you to get to your man! Watch out for Edie! Sheridan is just right for this caustic, little sexy villainess of the street. Yes, all the women shine in their glory of the show! Better than anything else on TV right now, and probably in the future, "Desperate Housewives" will satisfy to the very touch of perfection, and beyond!

Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman, Nicolette Sheridan, and James Denton create the most bizarre and un believably satirical world of Wisteria Lane, a beautiful neighborhood with beautiful woman, each lives the perfect life...on the outside! Matching "American Beauty" with "Melrose Place", this fresh, raunchy, and intelligent show revolves around four women who begin uncovering a series of mysteries when their best friend commits suicide. Susan Mayer(Teri Hatcher) is a Striking, chirpy woman with a beautiful daughter and a great romance with Mike Delfino(James Denton), but her flaw of natural klutziness gets her in trouble. Hatcher is irresistibly funny, and brings hysterics to the screen. Bree Van De Camp(Marcia Cross) is the stereotypical "Stepford" wife who brings jealousy to the most sweetest of ladies with her perfect life, blue flowers, smart kids, and exceptional marriage...RIGHT! Her life consists of struggling to retain her marriage, or lack there of. Her children hate her most of the time, and her husband can't stand her perfection. Cross is remarkably powerful in performance, and displays witty charm, and howlingly hilarious reactions to the events surrounding her. Not to mention being gorgeous beyond belief! Lynette Scavo(Felicity Huffman) gets the most sympathy from us as the successful woman, on her way to becoming the most powerful woman in business, and then pregnancy after pregnancy takes it all away. Now, she struggles with the most out-of-control children in television history, and a husband who just doesn't get it, or any thing else! Huffman is exceptional in this role, and deserves the recognition for her efforts. She gains so much sympathy when she breaks on children's medication, Lynette is one most people would love to sit and "bitch" with, I know I would. Next is Gabrielle Solis(Eva Longoria), the perfect woman, the rich marriage the most dreaming life of the block...AS IF! She sleeps with teens, and worms her way in and out of situations both good and bad, but she has her funny moments. Longoria is predictably slutty temptress, with minor qualities to redeem, so far. With a little learning for Gabrielle, we might see more than pretty faces with Mrs. Solis, but Longoria is alright. Last, but NEVER least, is Edie Britt(Nicolette Sheridan), a man-hungry woman with a wip and handcuffs! She will walk all over you to get to your man! Watch out for Edie! Sheridan is just right for this caustic, little sexy villainess of the street. Yes, all the women shine in their glory of the show! Better than anything else on TV right now, and probably in the future, "Desperate Housewives" will satisfy to the very touch of perfection, and beyond!

The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian.

Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman, Nicolette Sheridan, and James Denton create the most bizarre and un believably satirical world of Wisteria Lane, a beautiful neighborhood with beautiful woman, each lives the perfect life...on the outside! Matching "American Beauty" with "Melrose Place", this fresh, raunchy, and intelligent show revolves around four women who begin uncovering a series of mysteries when their best friend commits suicide. Susan Mayer(Teri Hatcher) is a Striking, chirpy woman with a beautiful daughter and a great romance with Mike Delfino(James Denton), but her flaw of natural klutziness gets her in trouble. Hatcher is irresistibly funny, and brings hysterics to the screen. Bree Van De Camp(Marcia Cross) is the stereotypical "Stepford" wife who brings jealousy to the most sweetest of ladies with her perfect life, blue flowers, smart kids, and exceptional marriage...RIGHT! Her life consists of struggling to retain her marriage, or lack there of. Her children hate her most of the time, and her husband can't stand her perfection. Cross is remarkably powerful in performance, and displays witty charm, and howlingly hilarious reactions to the events surrounding her. Not to mention being gorgeous beyond belief! Lynette Scavo(Felicity Huffman) gets the most sympathy from us as the successful woman, on her way to becoming the most powerful woman in business, and then pregnancy after pregnancy takes it all away. Now, she struggles with the most out-of-control children in television history, and a husband who just doesn't get it, or any thing else! Huffman is exceptional in this role, and deserves the recognition for her efforts. She gains so much sympathy when she breaks on children's medication, Lynette is one most people would love to sit and "bitch" with, I know I would. Next is Gabrielle Solis(Eva Longoria), the perfect woman, the rich marriage the most dreaming life of the block...AS IF! She sleeps with teens, and worms her way in and out of situations both good and bad, but she has her funny moments. Longoria is predictably slutty temptress, with minor qualities to redeem, so far. With a little learning for Gabrielle, we might see more than pretty faces with Mrs. Solis, but Longoria is alright. Last, but NEVER least, is Edie Britt(Nicolette Sheridan), a man-hungry woman with a wip and handcuffs! She will walk all over you to get to your man! Watch out for Edie! Sheridan is just right for this caustic, little sexy villainess of the street. Yes, all the women shine in their glory of the show! Better than anything else on TV right now, and probably in the future, "Desperate Housewives" will satisfy to the very touch of perfection, and beyond! Marc Cherry has created a masterpiece with this one! Thank the almighty for this one coming to the TV screen! May we be blessed with this show for many, many years to come!!!!!

Its Susan, Bree, Lynette, Gabrielle, and Edie!","reviewBody":"Here it is! The best show to hit the prime time dial in years! Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman, Nicolette Sheridan, and James Denton create the most bizarre and un believably satirical world of Wisteria Lane, a beautiful neighborhood with beautiful woman, each lives the perfect life...on the outside! Matching "American Beauty" with "Melrose Place", this fresh, raunchy, and intelligent show revolves around four women who begin uncovering a series of mysteries when their best friend commits suicide. Susan Mayer(Teri Hatcher) is a Striking, chirpy woman with a beautiful daughter and a great romance with Mike Delfino(James Denton), but her flaw of natural klutziness gets her in trouble. Hatcher is irresistibly funny, and brings hysterics to the screen. Bree Van De Camp(Marcia Cross) is the stereotypical "Stepford" wife who brings jealousy to the most sweetest of ladies with her perfect life, blue flowers, smart kids, and exceptional marriage...RIGHT! Her life consists of struggling to retain her marriage, or lack there of. Her children hate her most of the time, and her husband can't stand her perfection. Cross is remarkably powerful in performance, and displays witty charm, and howlingly hilarious reactions to the events surrounding her. Not to mention being gorgeous beyond belief! Lynette Scavo(Felicity Huffman) gets the most sympathy from us as the successful woman, on her way to becoming the most powerful woman in business, and then pregnancy after pregnancy takes it all away. Now, she struggles with the most out-of-control children in television history, and a husband who just doesn't get it, or any thing else! Huffman is exceptional in this role, and deserves the recognition for her efforts. She gains so much sympathy when she breaks on children's medication, Lynette is one most people would love to sit and "bitch" with, I know I would. Next is Gabrielle Solis(Eva Longoria), the perfect woman, the rich marriage the most dreaming life of the block...AS IF! She sleeps with teens, and worms her way in and out of situations both good and bad, but she has her funny moments. Longoria is predictably slutty temptress, with minor qualities to redeem, so far. With a little learning for Gabrielle, we might see more than pretty faces with Mrs. Solis, but Longoria is alright. Last, but NEVER least, is Edie Britt(Nicolette Sheridan), a man-hungry woman with a wip and handcuffs! She will walk all over you to get to your man! Watch out for Edie! Sheridan is just right for this caustic, little sexy villainess of the street. Yes, all the women shine in their glory of the show! Better than anything else on TV right now, and probably in the future, "Desperate Housewives" will satisfy to the very touch of perfection, and beyond! Marc Cherry has created a masterpiece with this one! Thank the almighty for this one coming to the TV screen! May we be blessed with this show for many, many years to come!!!!! A perfect 10/10, 100% brilliant!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":122088,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-10-03","keywords":"conflict of interest,female protagonist,friend,neighborhood,suicide","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000159/","name":"Teri Hatcher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005031/","name":"Felicity Huffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0189220/","name":"Marcia Cross"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028589/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0156100/","name":"Marc Cherry"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1644955417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"TT #1"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman, Nicolette Sheridan, and James Denton create the most bizarre and un believably satirical world of Wisteria Lane, a beautiful neighborhood with beautiful woman, each lives the perfect life...on the outside! Matching "American Beauty" with "Melrose Place", this fresh, raunchy, and intelligent show revolves around four women who begin uncovering a series of mysteries when their best friend commits suicide. Susan Mayer(Teri Hatcher) is a Striking, chirpy woman with a beautiful daughter and a great romance with Mike Delfino(James Denton), but her flaw of natural klutziness gets her in trouble. Hatcher is irresistibly funny, and brings hysterics to the screen. Bree Van De Camp(Marcia Cross) is the stereotypical "Stepford" wife who brings jealousy to the most sweetest of ladies with her perfect life, blue flowers, smart kids, and exceptional marriage...RIGHT! Her life consists of struggling to retain her marriage, or lack there of. Her children hate her most of the time, and her husband can't stand her perfection. Cross is remarkably powerful in performance, and displays witty charm, and howlingly hilarious reactions to the events surrounding her. Not to mention being gorgeous beyond belief! Lynette Scavo(Felicity Huffman) gets the most sympathy from us as the successful woman, on her way to becoming the most powerful woman in business, and then pregnancy after pregnancy takes it all away. Now, she struggles with the most out-of-control children in television history, and a husband who just doesn't get it, or any thing else! Huffman is exceptional in this role, and deserves the recognition for her efforts. She gains so much sympathy when she breaks on children's medication, Lynette is one most people would love to sit and "bitch" with, I know I would. Next is Gabrielle Solis(Eva Longoria), the perfect woman, the rich marriage the most dreaming life of the block...AS IF! She sleeps with teens, and worms her way in and out of situations both good and bad, but she has her funny moments. Longoria is predictably slutty temptress, with minor qualities to redeem, so far. With a little learning for Gabrielle, we might see more than pretty faces with Mrs. Solis, but Longoria is alright. Last, but NEVER least, is Edie Britt(Nicolette Sheridan), a man-hungry woman with a wip and handcuffs! She will walk all over you to get to your man! Watch out for Edie! Sheridan is just right for this caustic, little sexy villainess of the street. Yes, all the women shine in their glory of the show! Better than anything else on TV right now, and probably in the future, "Desperate Housewives" will satisfy to the very touch of perfection, and beyond!

Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman, Nicolette Sheridan, and James Denton create the most bizarre and un believably satirical world of Wisteria Lane, a beautiful neighborhood with beautiful woman, each lives the perfect life...on the outside! Matching "American Beauty" with "Melrose Place", this fresh, raunchy, and intelligent show revolves around four women who begin uncovering a series of mysteries when their best friend commits suicide. Susan Mayer(Teri Hatcher) is a Striking, chirpy woman with a beautiful daughter and a great romance with Mike Delfino(James Denton), but her flaw of natural klutziness gets her in trouble. Hatcher is irresistibly funny, and brings hysterics to the screen. Bree Van De Camp(Marcia Cross) is the stereotypical "Stepford" wife who brings jealousy to the most sweetest of ladies with her perfect life, blue flowers, smart kids, and exceptional marriage...RIGHT! Her life consists of struggling to retain her marriage, or lack there of. Her children hate her most of the time, and her husband can't stand her perfection. Cross is remarkably powerful in performance, and displays witty charm, and howlingly hilarious reactions to the events surrounding her. Not to mention being gorgeous beyond belief! Lynette Scavo(Felicity Huffman) gets the most sympathy from us as the successful woman, on her way to becoming the most powerful woman in business, and then pregnancy after pregnancy takes it all away. Now, she struggles with the most out-of-control children in television history, and a husband who just doesn't get it, or any thing else! Huffman is exceptional in this role, and deserves the recognition for her efforts. She gains so much sympathy when she breaks on children's medication, Lynette is one most people would love to sit and "bitch" with, I know I would. Next is Gabrielle Solis(Eva Longoria), the perfect woman, the rich marriage the most dreaming life of the block...AS IF! She sleeps with teens, and worms her way in and out of situations both good and bad, but she has her funny moments. Longoria is predictably slutty temptress, with minor qualities to redeem, so far. With a little learning for Gabrielle, we might see more than pretty faces with Mrs. Solis, but Longoria is alright. Last, but NEVER least, is Edie Britt(Nicolette Sheridan), a man-hungry woman with a wip and handcuffs! She will walk all over you to get to your man! Watch out for Edie! Sheridan is just right for this caustic, little sexy villainess of the street. Yes, all the women shine in their glory of the show! Better than anything else on TV right now, and probably in the future, "Desperate Housewives" will satisfy to the very touch of perfection, and beyond! Marc Cherry has created a masterpiece with this one! Thank the almighty for this one coming to the TV screen! May we be blessed with this show for many, many years to come!!!!!

Matching "American Beauty" with "Melrose Place", this fresh, raunchy, and intelligent show revolves around four women who begin uncovering a series of mysteries when their best friend commits suicide.

The book was so watered down, and the story is almost unrecognizable. We saw precious little of Booby Miles' complexity or the pressures around him over which he had no control. We saw almost nothing of Chavez, one of the very few players who actually made something of himself, or what effect the high school football experience had on his success in life. And the other players ... their personal lives were so affected by what happened that single season, and it was pretty much ignored. There was so much background about the frenzy that Mojo generated (and still generates) in Odessa that just wasn't shown.\n\nThat being said, I can see why the people in Odessa so disapproved of the book and loved the movie. The movie doesn't show the rather affectionate, yet unflattering picture that Buzz Bissinger painted of the town. Instead, it only showed the stereotypical hype of small town football.

The book was so watered down, and the story is almost unrecognizable. We saw precious little of Booby Miles' complexity or the pressures around him over which he had no control. We saw almost nothing of Chavez, one of the very few players who actually made something of himself, or what effect the high school football experience had on his success in life. And the other players ... their personal lives were so affected by what happened that single season, and it was pretty much ignored. There was so much background about the frenzy that Mojo generated (and still generates) in Odessa that just wasn't shown.\n\nThat being said, I can see why the people in Odessa so disapproved of the book and loved the movie. The movie doesn't show the rather affectionate, yet unflattering picture that Buzz Bissinger painted of the town. Instead, it only showed the stereotypical hype of small town football. After seeing the movie, PLEASE do yourself a favor and read the book.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":61436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2004-10-08","keywords":"usa,united states,texas,football,coach","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Guide to the Films of Peter Berg","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3762141977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWMxNDkzMDItNDVhMS00ZWI3LWI2ZjctNjAyOTkxZjExOGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWMxNDkzMDItNDVhMS00ZWI3LWI2ZjctNjAyOTkxZjExOGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","description":"Ready for action?

Browbeaten, verbally abused, and harassed by everyone in his life, he takes the advice of his close friend (David Cross) to take a self-esteem class taught by a man named "Dr. P" (Billy Bob Thornton), who is quickly found to be the kind of self-esteem teacher to teach you the ways of confidence and self-worth by providing you with even more verbal abuse in your life. Roger's ultimate goal - besides earning respect from others - is to win the heart of his neighbor, an Australian graduate student named Amanda (Jacinda Barrett), who he can't seem to talk to without being met with a panic attack or fainting.\n\nTodd Phillips' School for Scoundrels is a remake of the 1960 film of the same name, which I can only imagine to be a bit nicer and less bossy in its tone and approach to its material. However, despite its over-arching mean-spiritedness as one of its themes, School for Scoundrels actually manages to be a consistently funny comedy, mostly thanks to its capable band of actors, all of whom have had some work in the comedy field and know just what to say and how to say it when the time is right.\n\nFor starters, consider Billy Bob Thornton, who is simply fearless as Dr. P here. Thornton has a way of assimilating well to any given role, be it a foul-mouthed mall-Santa, a questionable folk from the backwoods, or a browbeating self-esteem teacher. Thornton works well here because he's as brash and as off-color as the material, often assisted by his character's assistant "Lesher," played by Michael Clarke Duncan. Now consider Jon Heder who, before this, only got to show his skills in one of the most lackluster comedies of the last decade. Heder is a solid, sympathetic character here, especially for those who can see his characters' struggles and hunger for acceptance and are willing to buy into it. Some characters in films are the reason for their own problems (take virtually any Adam Sandler film from the nineties), but Heder's Roger is simply a bit geeky and a tad uncoordinated, and for that, is unfortunately the target for abuse and ridicule. On those notes alone, his character is easy to side with because he is relatively blameless.\n\nAlongside Heder are the likes of Sarah Silverman as Amanda's friend who continues to give Roger a hard time, Horatio Sanz, Aziz Ansari, David Cross, Dan Fogler, Luis Guzmán, Jim Parsons, and Ben Stiller (however, in a role of questionable value), all of whom very competent comedians who accentuate the quick-witted qualities that got them to that level in the first place. While School for Scoundrels gets by almost entirely on the charisma of its actors, Todd Phillips and Scot Armstrong's writing shouldn't go unnoticed. For the most part, the writing duo create an unabashedly fun, silly comedy with enough consistent laughs to warrant a recommendation.\n\nThe only struggle for the film is how it wants to achieve its climax, in this case, making the entire "get the girl" subplot too silly and way too overblown. The film was grounded in a certain, goofy reality up until maybe the eighty-minute mark, and for that reason, the film becomes a bit of a struggle to continue to buy into during its last twenty-five minutes. Regardless, it can't derail the comedic talent at hand, along with Jon Heder's Roger, who, for once, isn't picked on because of his own stupidity but for his own genial manner and geeky appearance. He's a character I can see many identifying with.\n\nThree years after the release of School for Scoundrels (which bombed at the box office and has now, eight years later, faded into almost complete obscurity), Todd Phillips hit a comedy homerun, financially, after directing all three Hangover films, effectively transcending his career into heavily-raunchy material and leaving geniality behind with School for Scoundrels. This is kind of an upsetting fact because this film has the unsung ability to identify when the two sequels leaching off the original Hangover were nothing but an annoyance to moviegoers. The film at hand rarely achieves comedic heights, but its dramatic ones are worth noting and appear to have been grossly shortchanged.\n\nStarring: Billy Bob Thornton, Jon Heder, Jacinda Barrett, Sarah Silverman, Horatio Sanz, David Cross, Dan Fogler, Luis Guzmán, Ben Stiller, Jim Parsons, and Aziz Ansari.

That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.\n\nAlthough entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, "Buffalo Bill." "Bill" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.\n\nJodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent "Clarice Starling" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as "Jack Crawford." A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts "Clarice," while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.\n\nHopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.\n\n"Silence Of The Lambs" has turned into a modern-day "classic." If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1339517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Horror"],"datePublished":"1991-02-14","keywords":"serial killer,psycho thriller,stuck in a well,psychopath,bad guy wins","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3377380121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ZiYzIyMWQtNDUyNy00YmExLWIwNmMtN2FhNzFiODgyYmU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ZiYzIyMWQtNDUyNy00YmExLWIwNmMtN2FhNzFiODgyYmU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0095029/","name":"Lawrence A.

That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.\n\nAlthough entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, "Buffalo Bill." "Bill" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.\n\nJodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent "Clarice Starling" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as "Jack Crawford." A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts "Clarice," while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.\n\nHopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.\n\n"Silence Of The Lambs" has turned into a modern-day "classic." If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1339517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Horror"],"datePublished":"1991-02-14","keywords":"serial killer,psycho thriller,stuck in a well,psychopath,bad guy wins","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3377380121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ZiYzIyMWQtNDUyNy00YmExLWIwNmMtN2FhNzFiODgyYmU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ZiYzIyMWQtNDUyNy00YmExLWIwNmMtN2FhNzFiODgyYmU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0095029/","name":"Lawrence A.

Not only is How to Train Your Dragon the best film of the year so far, but it even eclipses the quality of last years duel academy award winner Up.\n\nThe latest 3-D film to fly into theatres in so many weeks is also the best of its format (story wise), making Burton's overblown misfire Alice in Wonderland look even more pitiful. Dragon will no doubt enamour kids (excuse the cliché) of all ages while keeping parents not only awake but equally enthralled. This movie is sure to tug the hearts of anyone who has ever loved a pet and will undoubtedly draw tears from those who are so inclined.\n\nThe texture that can be created from today's CG technology never ceases to amaze. Consider a beautiful tracking shot of a downed dragon where the twisted wing that protrudes towards the screen is actually out of focus, as if you yourself were staring awestruck at the giant lizard that lay before you in real, tangible life. I did not have the pleasure to viewing How to Train Your Dragon in 3-D but I have heard great things and even without having paid a surcharge the film does in no way suffer as a result. The narrative, visuals, writing and voicework is ample reason to seek out Dragon and frankly is the real heart of the movie anyways.\n\nOn the Island of Berk, the Viking community that lives there does not fear a rival tribe, the weather or disease but rather a much more toothy threat: dragons. Nightly raids by the winged beasts have forged a great hatred upon the tribe and led by the aptly named Stoik the Vast (Gerard Butler) they wage war with the intent to rid themselves of dragons once and for all. This is not a feeling shared by Stoik's scrawny son Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) who favours non-lethal tactics as much as he does blacksmithing. Much to Hiccup's surprise, during one of the aforementioned raids he is able to down a dragon with one of his contraptions. Intent on proving his manhood to Stoik, he seeks out to find the dragon know as a Night Fury but finds himself unable to slay his scaly foe. So begins an unlikely and forbidden friendship with the later named Toothless that follows a time-tested but absolutely rewarding arc that is as enthralling as it is touching.\n\nJoining Butler and Baruchel, both of whom give excellent performances (with Butler recapturing some of his 300 mojo), are the likes of Craig Fergusson as the Viking blacksmith, America Ferrera as the feisty object of Hiccup's affections and a whole slice of the Apatow gang including Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill as other young warriors. Much like WALL-E, Toothless exhibits oodles of personality and is endlessly endearing. To achieve this level of depth is perhaps even more impressive due to the fact that he never utters a word and must emote through non-verbal means.\n\nAlong with Kung Fu Panda this movie represents the highest ilk of the Dreamworks repertoire and that is not a backhanded compliment by any means. Like Panda, there are thrilling and well choreographed action sequences to compliment the heart, and plenty of humour to keep this from becoming too much of a dramatic slog for younger theatre goers. Teenager or adult, fan or animation or not if you like truly good cinema, you will not be unsatisfied by How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nRead all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":697462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2010-03-31","keywords":"dragon,viking,village,father son relationship,island","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"How to Train Your Dragon: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1158218777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FiZDUxZTMtMzUxMi00NzYxLTg0NzEtNzViYTY4N2Y2MWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FiZDUxZTMtMzUxMi00NzYxLTg0NzEtNzViYTY4N2Y2MWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Young Viking Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the Third (voice of Jay Baruchel) is sent to the Isle of Berk in the North Sea, where he is to subdue a dragon as a rite of passage."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059431/","name":"Jay Baruchel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2395586/","name":"Christopher Mintz-Plasse"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0213450/","name":"Dean DeBlois"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0266260/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0084207/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204030/","name":"William Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0213450/","name":"Dean DeBlois"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Not only is How to Train Your Dragon the best film of the year so far, but it even eclipses the quality of last years duel academy award winner Up.\n\nThe latest 3-D film to fly into theatres in so many weeks is also the best of its format (story wise), making Burton's overblown misfire Alice in Wonderland look even more pitiful. Dragon will no doubt enamour kids (excuse the cliché) of all ages while keeping parents not only awake but equally enthralled. This movie is sure to tug the hearts of anyone who has ever loved a pet and will undoubtedly draw tears from those who are so inclined.\n\nThe texture that can be created from today's CG technology never ceases to amaze. Consider a beautiful tracking shot of a downed dragon where the twisted wing that protrudes towards the screen is actually out of focus, as if you yourself were staring awestruck at the giant lizard that lay before you in real, tangible life. I did not have the pleasure to viewing How to Train Your Dragon in 3-D but I have heard great things and even without having paid a surcharge the film does in no way suffer as a result. The narrative, visuals, writing and voicework is ample reason to seek out Dragon and frankly is the real heart of the movie anyways.\n\nOn the Island of Berk, the Viking community that lives there does not fear a rival tribe, the weather or disease but rather a much more toothy threat: dragons. Nightly raids by the winged beasts have forged a great hatred upon the tribe and led by the aptly named Stoik the Vast (Gerard Butler) they wage war with the intent to rid themselves of dragons once and for all. This is not a feeling shared by Stoik's scrawny son Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) who favours non-lethal tactics as much as he does blacksmithing. Much to Hiccup's surprise, during one of the aforementioned raids he is able to down a dragon with one of his contraptions. Intent on proving his manhood to Stoik, he seeks out to find the dragon know as a Night Fury but finds himself unable to slay his scaly foe. So begins an unlikely and forbidden friendship with the later named Toothless that follows a time-tested but absolutely rewarding arc that is as enthralling as it is touching.\n\nJoining Butler and Baruchel, both of whom give excellent performances (with Butler recapturing some of his 300 mojo), are the likes of Craig Fergusson as the Viking blacksmith, America Ferrera as the feisty object of Hiccup's affections and a whole slice of the Apatow gang including Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill as other young warriors. Much like WALL-E, Toothless exhibits oodles of personality and is endlessly endearing. To achieve this level of depth is perhaps even more impressive due to the fact that he never utters a word and must emote through non-verbal means.\n\nAlong with Kung Fu Panda this movie represents the highest ilk of the Dreamworks repertoire and that is not a backhanded compliment by any means. Like Panda, there are thrilling and well choreographed action sequences to compliment the heart, and plenty of humour to keep this from becoming too much of a dramatic slog for younger theatre goers. Teenager or adult, fan or animation or not if you like truly good cinema, you will not be unsatisfied by How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nRead all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":697462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2010-03-31","keywords":"dragon,viking,village,father son relationship,island","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"How to Train Your Dragon: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1158218777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FiZDUxZTMtMzUxMi00NzYxLTg0NzEtNzViYTY4N2Y2MWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FiZDUxZTMtMzUxMi00NzYxLTg0NzEtNzViYTY4N2Y2MWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Young Viking Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the Third (voice of Jay Baruchel) is sent to the Isle of Berk in the North Sea, where he is to subdue a dragon as a rite of passage.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059431/","name":"Jay Baruchel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2395586/","name":"Christopher Mintz-Plasse"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0213450/","name":"Dean DeBlois","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0266260/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0084207/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204030/","name":"William Davies","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0213450/","name":"Dean DeBlois","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is simply a star-studded action thriller designed to allow the audience to escape into the world of Chicago hostage squad cops. A wrongfully accused negotiator/cop, played at about 300+ degrees Fahrenheit by Samuel Jackson matches wits with another negotiator, Kevin Spacey, who does his best to keep Jackson from reaching the boiling point. Briefly, Jackson is caught in the middle of an extortion scandal involving the lifting of millions of dollars from the policeman's pension fund. When Jackson's partner becomes aware of the secret heist, he is taken out, and the powers behind the white-collar corporate dealings use Jackson as the scapegoat. Jackson then retaliates by using extra-legal means.\n\nWhat makes this movie are the performances by both Jackson and Spacey, with good performances by the supporting cast, including the late J.T.

And John Spencer is also involved as the Chief of Police, shortly before he was promoted to the White House Chief of Staff in "The West Wing".\n\nThe movie goes a mile a minute but is suffused with an interesting enough storyline to make it well worth the price of admission.

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura.

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":691185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"],"duration":"PT2H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Just in case you have forgotten, the movie does remind you just how wicked teenage girls can be ... even the good ones. The film centers around the annual family reunion at the parents' (Dianne Weist, John Mahoney) beautiful summer house in Rhode Island.

Odd casting does help.\n\nDane Cook and Emily Blunt have supporting roles that are both very well done. Personally I find it difficult to ever really like Dane Cook, but he controls his freak pretty well here. Ms. Blunt is a budding star (see "The Devil Wears Prada") and sooner or later, Hollywood will find the right roles to showcase her talents. By far the most outside the box casting occurs with Juliette Binoche in the pivotal role of Marie. Not to give too much away, but she does give new meaning to brotherly love.\n\nCarell is fine and at least isn't falling into the one-trick pony career of Ben Stiller. He does have some range as an actor and hopefully will mix in a few dramas with the slapstick. Wouldn't call this anything close to a classic, but it is a movie families (not the youngsters) can watch together and be entertained ... nothing wrong with that.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

What's not to like about that?\n\nThis film is set in the same universe as Harry Potter, except in 1926, in New York. It is centered on the wizard Newt Scamander, who brings magical a suitcase containing Magical Creatures to New York, but when the creatures come loose, its up to him and his friends to get them back to avoid getting exposed to non magical people. The movie mostly has a good pace, and is fun. It also introduces interesting ideas to the universe, which really got me intrigued. However, it can be confusing, and hard to get into at first. When I watched it, it took me 10-15 minutes to understand it. But those little nitpicks don't take away the good writing this film has.\n\nFor the characters of this film, they are a pretty enjoyable cast. The main character Newt (I'm just going to be honest) is a moron. Seriously why would anyone think that bringing a suitcase of magical creatures that isn't 100% secure to a city of non magical people is a wonderful idea? However, he is a fun character with a goofy personality and if great to follow. Also joining the adventure, is the auror Tina and her sister Queenie, who are likable and contribute to the adventure. But my favorite character is Jacob, who is a no-maj(non magical person) who gets involved in the adventure and helps Newt. I liked how he has a goofy personality and is very funny. The fantastic beasts in the movie are also really funny, and cute as well. I only mentioned those because the rest of the cast involves spoilers, but the characters are overall pleasant additions to the Harry Potter universe.\n\nThe visual effects in this movie are better than shown in the other 8 Harry Potter movies. The budget is 180 million and it shows. The design of the animals are brilliant, (just to avoid the "fantastic" pun)with unique abilities, and they all stand out rather than simply having dragons. Other magic in the film is unique (like the suitcase). I like how this film used many more of these ideas to bring to life and doesn't make it stand out as much in the action scenes or use gimmicks (unlike the other Harry Potter films). So overall, brilliant visual effects to add to this film.\n\nAfter the Harry Potter films, I didn't expect this spin-off to be this good, but I was wrong. The movie is overall a holiday treat with a Fun story and characters, interesting ideas, and awesome effects. It is a recommendation from me indeed, and after this, we'll see if the next spin-off coming to theaters near us, Rouge One: A Star Wars Story, can top this.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":429975,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-11-16","keywords":"magic,wizard,suitcase,based on novel,magical creature","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1553839641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTExOTQ2NDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYyOTYxMDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTExOTQ2NDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYyOTYxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519666/","name":"Eddie Redmayne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2239702/","name":"Katherine Waterston"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0837223/","name":"Alison Sudol"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0946734/","name":"David Yates"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

It has good humour, plenty of violence, bad language, stunning cinematography and perfect pacing. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn't enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation. \n\nFirst off, the casting and character selection is very impressive, Colin Firth in particular shows us again his splendid acting abilities. He is the perfect choice for the role he played, in my opinion. The lead character, who the story focuses around - Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton), does a good job playing his character, although I personally found him very irritating. He plays a young chavvy youth, making the transition from street kid to secret agent. He brings the urban language, attitude and temperament to the service which is very out of place but necessary for the story. Samuel L Jackson plays the bad guy very well. The quirkiness and style portrayed is fun to see and fits the style of the movie well. Michael Caine, Mark Strong and all the other supporting cast don't feel out of place (if not a little stereotypical from some of them), they still do a notable job.\n\nIt is refreshing to see a movie of this genre so well made with a strong cast, not hold back when it comes to violence. The violence in the movie is one of the most inspiring aspects, it isn't over the top and you never feel like it has gone 'too far' but it is certainly more graphic than your average mainstream movie of this genre. There is a church scene in particular which stands out for me, it has a perfectly choreographed, one camera shot, fluid moving scene which is simply perfect. It's violent, with some surprisingly fresh martial arts and a cool choice of music to go with it!\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service is different to your usual run of the mill spy movie. It's hard to explain until you watch it, but it's got a certain spin on it, it's quirky, funny and makes many references to other spy movies and how this is a parody. Not in the sense of Austin Powers but it does make tongue in cheek references to James Bond, with some striking similarities. It has style, a fun and quirk edge and it is beautifully made with a plausible run time of just under 2 hours. Believe the hype and give this movie a watch. It's definitely worth your time!\n\n8/10\n\nP.S. The outrage that seems to have swept the internet over the very last scene (so much so, that some versions of this movie have the scene removed) is nothing short of ridiculous. It's political correctness gone mad.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":618603,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-29","keywords":"spy,female rear nudity,training,class differences,secret organization","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1901244185","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A super-secret spy organization recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5473782/","name":"Taron Egerton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

It has good humour, plenty of violence, bad language, stunning cinematography and perfect pacing. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn't enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation. \n\nFirst off, the casting and character selection is very impressive, Colin Firth in particular shows us again his splendid acting abilities. He is the perfect choice for the role he played, in my opinion. The lead character, who the story focuses around - Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton), does a good job playing his character, although I personally found him very irritating. He plays a young chavvy youth, making the transition from street kid to secret agent. He brings the urban language, attitude and temperament to the service which is very out of place but necessary for the story. Samuel L Jackson plays the bad guy very well. The quirkiness and style portrayed is fun to see and fits the style of the movie well. Michael Caine, Mark Strong and all the other supporting cast don't feel out of place (if not a little stereotypical from some of them), they still do a notable job.\n\nIt is refreshing to see a movie of this genre so well made with a strong cast, not hold back when it comes to violence. The violence in the movie is one of the most inspiring aspects, it isn't over the top and you never feel like it has gone 'too far' but it is certainly more graphic than your average mainstream movie of this genre. There is a church scene in particular which stands out for me, it has a perfectly choreographed, one camera shot, fluid moving scene which is simply perfect. It's violent, with some surprisingly fresh martial arts and a cool choice of music to go with it!\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service is different to your usual run of the mill spy movie. It's hard to explain until you watch it, but it's got a certain spin on it, it's quirky, funny and makes many references to other spy movies and how this is a parody. Not in the sense of Austin Powers but it does make tongue in cheek references to James Bond, with some striking similarities. It has style, a fun and quirk edge and it is beautifully made with a plausible run time of just under 2 hours. Believe the hype and give this movie a watch. It's definitely worth your time!\n\n8/10\n\nP.S. The outrage that seems to have swept the internet over the very last scene (so much so, that some versions of this movie have the scene removed) is nothing short of ridiculous. It's political correctness gone mad.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":618603,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-29","keywords":"spy,female rear nudity,training,class differences,secret organization","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1901244185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A super-secret spy organization recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5473782/","name":"Taron Egerton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

What's not to like about that?\n\nThis film is set in the same universe as Harry Potter, except in 1926, in New York. It is centered on the wizard Newt Scamander, who brings magical a suitcase containing Magical Creatures to New York, but when the creatures come loose, its up to him and his friends to get them back to avoid getting exposed to non magical people. The movie mostly has a good pace, and is fun. It also introduces interesting ideas to the universe, which really got me intrigued. However, it can be confusing, and hard to get into at first. When I watched it, it took me 10-15 minutes to understand it. But those little nitpicks don't take away the good writing this film has.\n\nFor the characters of this film, they are a pretty enjoyable cast. The main character Newt (I'm just going to be honest) is a moron. Seriously why would anyone think that bringing a suitcase of magical creatures that isn't 100% secure to a city of non magical people is a wonderful idea? However, he is a fun character with a goofy personality and if great to follow. Also joining the adventure, is the auror Tina and her sister Queenie, who are likable and contribute to the adventure. But my favorite character is Jacob, who is a no-maj(non magical person) who gets involved in the adventure and helps Newt. I liked how he has a goofy personality and is very funny. The fantastic beasts in the movie are also really funny, and cute as well. I only mentioned those because the rest of the cast involves spoilers, but the characters are overall pleasant additions to the Harry Potter universe.\n\nThe visual effects in this movie are better than shown in the other 8 Harry Potter movies. The budget is 180 million and it shows. The design of the animals are brilliant, (just to avoid the "fantastic" pun)with unique abilities, and they all stand out rather than simply having dragons. Other magic in the film is unique (like the suitcase). I like how this film used many more of these ideas to bring to life and doesn't make it stand out as much in the action scenes or use gimmicks (unlike the other Harry Potter films). So overall, brilliant visual effects to add to this film.\n\nAfter the Harry Potter films, I didn't expect this spin-off to be this good, but I was wrong. The movie is overall a holiday treat with a Fun story and characters, interesting ideas, and awesome effects. It is a recommendation from me indeed, and after this, we'll see if the next spin-off coming to theaters near us, Rouge One: A Star Wars Story, can top this.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":429975,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-11-16","keywords":"magic,wizard,suitcase,based on novel,magical creature","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1553839641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTExOTQ2NDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYyOTYxMDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTExOTQ2NDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYyOTYxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519666/","name":"Eddie Redmayne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2239702/","name":"Katherine Waterston"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0837223/","name":"Alison Sudol"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0946734/","name":"David Yates"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

It is a recommendation from me indeed, and after this, we'll see if the next spin-off coming to theaters near us, Rouge One: A Star Wars Story, can top this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":429975,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-11-16","keywords":"magic,wizard,suitcase,based on novel,magical creature","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1553839641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTExOTQ2NDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYyOTYxMDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTExOTQ2NDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYyOTYxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519666/","name":"Eddie Redmayne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2239702/","name":"Katherine Waterston","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0837223/","name":"Alison Sudol"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0946734/","name":"David Yates"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

At it's core it is a movie about Grindlewald's rise to power. However, this plot is bogged down by so much unnecessary information that it's very frusturating to watch. Newt and his friends are very inconsiquential and feel shoehored in along with a couple other side plots. Grindlewald, Dumbledore, and Creedence were all interesting characters, but everyone else seemed pointless and unnecessary.

At it's core it is a movie about Grindlewald's rise to power. However, this plot is bogged down by so much unnecessary information that it's very frusturating to watch. Newt and his friends are very inconsiquential and feel shoehored in along with a couple other side plots. Grindlewald, Dumbledore, and Creedence were all interesting characters, but everyone else seemed pointless and unnecessary. I wanted to like this movie, but I ended up walking out feeling disappointed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":240338,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2018-11-16","keywords":"wizard,magical creature,paris france,sequel,witch","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Watch the Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi965130777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlMmE1OTktODA5Yi00NDc3LTg4NDgtYzcyOTU2Nzg1OWU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlMmE1OTktODA5Yi00NDc3LTg4NDgtYzcyOTU2Nzg1OWU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519666/","name":"Eddie Redmayne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2239702/","name":"Katherine Waterston","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0283945/","name":"Dan Fogler"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0946734/","name":"David Yates"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

Animators are puppeteers first. So if you asked an animator to come up with a story, naturally you will find two features: one would involve two on-screen characters, one the animator of the other. We have many jokes associated with how imperfectly the on-screen animator (our hero) works his puppet at first. Incidentally, this movie is preceded in the theater by a short: "Lifting." It features a novice "animator" of precisely this type, being graded. Notice the infinite panel of switches in that short.\n\nCount on Pixar to find yet another way to fold introspection into the form. This is elaborated by the character of a critic. We see him first in a coffin-like office. He's only capable of destruction it seems. Voiced by Peter O'Toole in a stentorian voice-about-theater, he likes what he sees (tastes). Its a great trick you see. Usually this trick is in the form of an on screen audience watching some sort of climactic performance. When they cheer, we do too, as we become folded into the story.\n\nIn this case, that is handled by a place made for us and occupied by "the critic." So we have a place in the story for the animator and the viewer. What else? We'll need a place for the animation, right? And we have it.\n\nIt appears first as a book by a now dead, corpulent chef. This book, natch, comes alive. Look how "Ted's law" is followed: the distance between the "real" world of ourselves and the animated movie is the same as that from the animated movie and the "living cartoon" within. Its an explicit fold. And the fact that the inner cartoon has an open, personal feel to it conveys to the personal feel we are intended to have with the Pixar movie.\n\nSo these three folds: in the story is the story, the animator and the viewer. And the introductory short sets this up too.\n\nHaving said that, there are a couple noteworthy segments. In terms of the actual craft, Pixar has two areas in which it innovates.\n\nOne of these in how space is handled. The Pixar guys realized early on that if the three dimensions are going to be modeled anyway, you can zip the camera around in new ways. Early in the game they did this in an overt way. That's been picked up by the summer action films, the best of them, including the Depp pirate business. (Another Disney project benefiting from the eye motion lab.)\n\nYou can see this throughout the project: there are both all sorts of well managed, unusual perspectives, and a constant overlay of new shots. By this I mean that every shot is just a little different than what you've seen. Just a little canted. A little closer perhaps. A little movement that a physical camera cannot do well.\n\nBut there are some big production sequences as well. I'm particularly interested in architectural water. Its a unique cinematic challenge. Its not one done well in animation because the mathematics of simply making water look real is daunting. Pixar has done what needs to be done: they have made water hyper-real, dramatic. There's a sequence here that is something like that Pinnochio sequence of 67 years ago with the whale. But its so new and fresh and exciting. Look at the water and see that it has a million tiny agents all seeking to be angry  to do damage but never reaching consensus on just how to attack. This alone is worth the admission.\n\nThere's another thing that is uniquely Pixar: how characters move. Its a tricky thing, that. As with the water, it is not ever enough that they move realistically. You can make realistic movements by outfitting actors with sensors and translating that to the created beings. It captures nuance. And if you have a particularly skilled source actor, he or she will move not as a real person would, but as an actor would to convey reality. Real isn't real. We need hyperreal in special ways to get- read the reality.\n\nThe credits of this movie ostentatiously say that ""Our Quality Assurance Guarantee: 100% Genuine Animation! No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film." You can see it. We are entering a new era where both the cameras and the characters can use dramatic motions not possible with human eyes and bodies.\n\nIts a challenge for viewers. What do we accept as embodiment? So far, the answer is that the non-natural movements must always be in the service of conveying or seeming natural. But I imagine at the speed this is developing, we may soon see something more.\n\nOne character note: Colette is voiced by the remarkable Janeane Garofalo. As with our hero, she has that French nose. As the love develops between these two, she becomes decidedly more sexy, both in voice and appearance. Its the appearance that I remark on here. Its all done with postures and a motorcycle. That motorcycle is there in part to allow her to bend forward, and change her lower anatomy. \n\nThese folks at Pixar are good. Darn good. Glad its Steve Jobs as the creative inspiration instead of that evil other guy.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":672861,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2007-08-22","keywords":"rat,chef,ratatouille,cooking,paris france","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ratatouille","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi906147865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU0YmUzZTQtZDU4ZS00NWYxLWJlNDMtOWE0ZWIzOGJmODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU0YmUzZTQtZDU4ZS00NWYxLWJlNDMtOWE0ZWIzOGJmODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #2, Post"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004951/","name":"Brad Garrett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738918/","name":"Lou Romano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652663/","name":"Patton Oswalt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083348/","name":"Brad Bird"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684342/","name":"Jan Pinkava"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083348/","name":"Brad Bird"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684342/","name":"Jan Pinkava"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135296/","name":"Jim Capobianco"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Shadows of clothes in the closet. Weird sounds outside in the trees. I remember thinking there were all kinds of monsters in my room - not as much under my bed as in the closet. And once again, Pixar, who brought us "Toy Story" 1 &amp; 2, plays on both adults' memories and children's dreams, making it equally enjoyable for both children and adults.\n\nJohn Goodman voices James P. Sullivan, known as "Sulley" to friends. He is a big, blue, hairy monster with horns on his head and hands the size of a watermelon. Billy Crystal is Mike Wazowski, his wisecracking, one-eyed best friend. Both of these monsters live in Monstropolis, a world where monsters roam freely. Their city is powered by a rare source of power - children's screams. That is where Monsters, Incorporated comes in. At Monsters, Inc., monsters like Sulley and Mike open portals into children's rooms - through closet doors - and scare the children, capturing their scream in a little yellow bottle. Sulley is the top-scarer, bringing in the most scares. But Randall (the always enjoyable - even when animated - Steve Buscemi), a wormy, multiple-armed lizard-monster with the ability to change appearances to its surroundings, is jealous of Sulley, and will attempt anything to get more scares...even if it means taking a child from the real world and bringing it into Monstropolis. But after the child escapes, Sulley and Mike reluctantly look after it, all the while trying to get it back to the real world before Mr. Waternoose (the late James Coburn) and others find out about the incident...\n\n"Monsters, Inc." does for monsters what "Toy Story" did for toys. Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my "Toy Story" review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of "Toy Story" and "Monsters, Inc.," but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for "Toy Story 3") and gives them the bare minimum.\n\nBut that is straying off the subject. "Monsters, Inc." is one of the most enjoyable animated films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I didn't enjoy it as much the first time, but I then bought it, and have since watched it many times. It is an instant classic. I will be watching it years from now, when I am old and frail and in a rocking chair. It ranks right up there with "Toy Story" 1 &amp; 2, and all the OLDER Disney films from the 50's-70's. It has all the elements of a sweet, charming, emotional and pleasurably good-natured animated film. And, more coudos to Pixar: Thank you for not packing it full of the language and inappropriate content that Disney shoves into the dark recesses of their films nowadays.\n\nNot only has Pixar brought back the "Family Film" genre to what it should be, but it also redefines it. Pixar's animated films are some of the most thoughtful, imaginative and enjoyable animated films ever - not to mention 100 % family safe. Thank you, Pixar, for getting back on track.\n\n5/5 stars","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":853368,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-04-10","keywords":"monster world,monster,human nonhuman relationship,portal door,scream","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"3D Re-release Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi518890521","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc5NTE4OTI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc5NTE4OTI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Monsters generate their city's power by scaring children, but they are terribly afraid themselves of being contaminated by children, so when one enters Monstropolis, top scarer Sulley finds his world disrupted.

I will be watching it years from now, when I am old and frail and in a rocking chair. It ranks right up there with "Toy Story" 1 &amp; 2, and all the OLDER Disney films from the 50's-70's. It has all the elements of a sweet, charming, emotional and pleasurably good-natured animated film. And, more coudos to Pixar: Thank you for not packing it full of the language and inappropriate content that Disney shoves into the dark recesses of their films nowadays.\n\nNot only has Pixar brought back the "Family Film" genre to what it should be, but it also redefines it. Pixar's animated films are some of the most thoughtful, imaginative and enjoyable animated films ever - not to mention 100 % family safe. Thank you, Pixar, for getting back on track.\n\n5/5 stars","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":853368,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-04-10","keywords":"monster world,monster,human nonhuman relationship,portal door,scream","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"3D Re-release Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi518890521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc5NTE4OTI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc5NTE4OTI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Monsters generate their city's power by scaring children, but they are terribly afraid themselves of being contaminated by children, so when one enters Monstropolis, top scarer Sulley finds his world disrupted.

The subtitle The Second Part is surely a half truth considering how this narrative slapped together by the original writers Christopher Miller and Phil Lord seems tacked on in a "Oh let's take a victory lap then" sense. The new director Mike Mitchell is planted into a zero sum game as he tries to reignite the novelty of the first film while propelling a more mature plot that Miller and Lord insisted on being needlessly convoluted. This sequel comes off as a afterthought worthy to stand beside the other spinoff LEGO films, but lacks all of the magic of its predecessor.\n\nThe magic present in The LEGO Movie resides in the playful allegory of capitalism mixed with the earned nostalgia of the animation's medium. Not to mention the brilliant reveal of a child's imagination directing the entire story. These are all elements revisited the second time around, but the trick has already been explained by the magician. The world of Brickville goes through sufficient changes almost immediately once toddler-sized LEGO creations attack with unrivaled fury. The brick civilization reverts to a Mad Max world after the invincible fat-bricked organisms regularly search and destroy anything colorful or shiny.\n\nThrough some less-than-subtle live action mirage shots early in the film, its apparent that Finn (Jadon Sand) the boy mastermind in the first film is being plagued by his younger sister Bianca (Brooklynn Prince). Her entry-level LEGO creations clash with his more involved and complex structures, and the result is a sibling pair never learning to play in symbiosis. Of course this conflict is merely implied before the lazy live action finale that resolves the paper thin dispute, and wholly lacks the gusto of the first movie's twist. The jig is already up from scene one of the sequel, because we are aware of the children's narrative dictatorship, so none of the LEGO characters' sentience ever feels authentic.\n\nChris Pratt returns to voice Emmet a happy-go-lucky construction worker who retains a life of cheer in the apocalyptic wasteland. Elizabeth Banks also reprises her role as Lucy, the brawn and brains to Emmet's fumbling optimism. Lucy desperately attempts to calibrate Emmet's persona to something more appropriate to the ruined world they now live in, but he maintains the "everything is awesome" outlook that figures problematic in a much more adult environment. In a hardly tongue-in-cheek fashion, a character outright states the thesis of the movie to be "a statement on the waning affects of adolescence on imagination." This stands as the most egregious example of "meta exploitation," but several runner ups tail close behind.\n\nFalling victim to exhausting cleverness, LEGO Movie 2 doesn't know when to edit its goofs. When you merely reformat the first film's plot to fit another child builder, new additions need to elevate the otherwise regurgitated formula. These additions include ramping up the meta meter to 11 and including two more banger tracks to hopefully burrow into the viewers' minds. The main attraction song here has a hook the repeats endlessly, "This song's gonna get stuck inside your head." Oh and I mustn't forget the cameos, which come with This is the End regularity, and if you can imagine, with far less originality.\n\nI didn't waste your time by running you down a plot synopsis for good reason. The film plays with your expectations in a cheap and unearned fashion without offering any reasonable explanation upon the conclusion other than, "We just wanted to plant red herrings, because...reasons." Screenwriters will go to great (and absurd) lengths to make an unoriginal script appear more interesting. This parasitic sequel will deliver many chuckles and feels to audiences that have already surrendered to the committee-made trajectory of the LEGO universe, but I feel somber for those choosing to double feature this lackadaisical copy with its bold predecessor.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60566,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-02-07","keywords":"lego,sequel,queen,spaceship,vampire","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2788407833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It's been five years since everything was awesome and the citizens are facing a huge new threat: LEGO DUPLO invaders from outer space, wrecking everything faster than they can rebuild.

Think "Chocolat". Think "Amelie". Think "What dreams may come". Perhaps even, "Being John Malkovich". And this year, it's time to think big... "Big Fish", to be precise. All four of these movies have some things in common. Merely describing the premise is not nearly enough to do justice to the mood of the film. And the mood, the emotional reaction of the audience, is in many ways much more important than the actual content. Still, there's no way around it in a proper review: We meet a disillusioned young man and his father, a charming old guy who knows exactly how to tell stories to fascinate first-time listeners and children. Unfortunately, there's barely any of those left, as he retold his magical stories once too often. When his health and life are beginning to fade away, his son wants to finally learn the truth about his father. Meanwhile, we hear his life story, as he tells it... Tim Burton is probably best-known for visual eye candy movies. Few directors can compete with the imagination he's shown in movies like Batman, Nightmare before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. Outside the realm of darker, more gothic visuals, Tim Burton has so far been somewhat less prolific. Planet of the Apes was an expensive embarrassment, and Ed Wood is a decidedly acquired taste. Big Fish, then, is a new direction for him. Yes, it is eye candy, or perhaps even eye H"agen Dazs. But this time, the movie has much more of a soul than his monkeyplanet. This soul is achieved by two means: a great story (or collection of stories) and great acting. If you don't believe that the story is great, watch the audience. At key moments, everyone was chuckling or laughing, at others, I heard dozens of sniffs and tissues being unpacked around me. Yes, this is heartwarming stuff that a colder, more cynical soul would call cheese. Finally, Burton has found a story worthy of his talents again. And, better yet, he did not forget to encourage his cast to act. For a case study of such failure, see Christina Ricci's completely flat performance in Sleepy Hollow. In Big Fish, the cast is so carefully selected that failure is simply not an option. Ewan McGregor (playing the father in his youth) may not have much more to do than smile, be charming and sustain a Southern US accent, but he does it brilliantly. Much more important are the performances of Albert Finney and Jessica Lange, playing the aged father and mother, respectively. And they both deliver character performances worthy of prizes.\n\nAfter cheerleading so enthusiastically for this movie, perhaps it is time to take a step back and look at it from a more critical perspective. Yes, it managed to enchant the audience, but it did so the Hollywood way. Special effects and big budget feature heavily. This is in stark contrast to the seemingly much less organized and much more intuitional charm of Amelie. This movie is also much more comfy about its pace - it takes its time just like a good storyteller would, but perhaps leaving behind the five-second-attention-span MTV generation kids in the process. On the other hand, I am tempted to say that its biggest vice is that there just isn't enough of it. Given the episodal structure of this movie, I can almost imagine what it would have felt like as TV series, or multi-part TV movie. I am not sure whether to wish for this to happen or shudder at the thought of "Big Fish: The Animated Series" or some such atrocity. Every story told in this movie is perfect, and a series of such perfect stories would be wonderful. Yet can perfection be sustained for a large number of stories? Either way, I wonder what is going to become of Big Fish - a franchise or a single movie.

It is not a masterpiece but it portrays convincingly the all too familiar case of a professional woman entering early middle age who is exploited by her social environment by subtle and less subtle ways. She obligingly perseveres until a session with an alternative therapist, about the existence of whom she learned while zapping on TV late in the night, has a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde effect on her character and behavior. I will not disclose more but I have to point out that the hedonistic consumerism of post-modern culture is ably presented, as well as the cult of youthfulness and boundless self-expression. Most of the characters are likeable despite or perhaps because of their foibles and faults. The bittersweet taste of life is displayed in a playful manner with Italian finesse. Ignore the highfalutin critics and watch this movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1031,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-06-19","keywords":"remake,italian remake,remake of chilean film,italian remake of chilean film,f rated","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2390539801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljNzU4NzQtZTY4MS00Zjg2LTlhNWEtNGY1MThjZDM2MDY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljNzU4NzQtZTY4MS00Zjg2LTlhNWEtNGY1MThjZDM2MDY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"A woman seeking treatment for her stress, suddenly finds herself unable to filter herself when she speaks.

It is not a masterpiece but it portrays convincingly the all too familiar case of a professional woman entering early middle age who is exploited by her social environment by subtle and less subtle ways. She obligingly perseveres until a session with an alternative therapist, about the existence of whom she learned while zapping on TV late in the night, has a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde effect on her character and behavior. I will not disclose more but I have to point out that the hedonistic consumerism of post-modern culture is ably presented, as well as the cult of youthfulness and boundless self-expression. Most of the characters are likeable despite or perhaps because of their foibles and faults. The bittersweet taste of life is displayed in a playful manner with Italian finesse. Ignore the highfalutin critics and watch this movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1031,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-06-19","keywords":"remake,italian remake,remake of chilean film,italian remake of chilean film,f rated","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2390539801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljNzU4NzQtZTY4MS00Zjg2LTlhNWEtNGY1MThjZDM2MDY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljNzU4NzQtZTY4MS00Zjg2LTlhNWEtNGY1MThjZDM2MDY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"A woman seeking treatment for her stress, suddenly finds herself unable to filter herself when she speaks.

But "Finding Nemo" is the one that remains unparalleled, not because of its comedy or creativity, both of which are equaled in the "Toy Story" movies and in "Monsters Inc.," but because it truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children's animated film.\n\nHumor in traditional animation is usually based on broad slapstick and physical exaggeration. There are occasional nods to this brand of humor in "Finding Nemo," as when a flock of seagulls ram into a boat and we see their beaks crowing on the other side of the sail. But such sequences only call attention to how far this movie generally departs from old cartoon conventions. Instead, the movie invests its world of sentient animals with a surprisingly scientific texture. All of the animals are based on real species. The fish tank is constructed out of real devices. There is a strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the Pacific to Australia, where even the animals speak with an Australian accent. In a scene that I'm sure Gary Larson of "Far Side" fame loved, a pelican discusses with a group of fish the intricate details of dentistry. The fact that the animals talk and understand what's going on is treated as though it were a natural feature of the world. The realism is so striking that by the end of the film, you'll almost believe it possible for fish to plot an escape from a tank.\n\nFar from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year-old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.\n\nThe story employs the same basic formula used in "Toy Story," in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they're forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I'm glad the filmmakers didn't lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film's biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film's director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant.\n\nOf course, none of the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans that Marlin encounters along the way really mean any harm. They're just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican tells Nemo at one point, "Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat." That's perhaps the film's most interesting insight, that there are no true villains, just creatures that act according to their nature, and a few that transcend it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":988305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-03","keywords":"pufferfish,shark,great barrier reef,short term memory loss,protective father","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"3D Re-release Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2687214105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMDYxNTUyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIwMjQ4Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMDYxNTUyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIwMjQ4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After his son is captured in the Great Barrier Reef and taken to Sydney, a timid clownfish sets out on a journey to bring him home.

All four of these movies have some things in common. Merely describing the premise is not nearly enough to do justice to the mood of the film. And the mood, the emotional reaction of the audience, is in many ways much more important than the actual content. Still, there's no way around it in a proper review: We meet a disillusioned young man and his father, a charming old guy who knows exactly how to tell stories to fascinate first-time listeners and children.

When his health and life are beginning to fade away, his son wants to finally learn the truth about his father. Meanwhile, we hear his life story, as he tells it... Tim Burton is probably best-known for visual eye candy movies. Few directors can compete with the imagination he's shown in movies like Batman, Nightmare before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. Outside the realm of darker, more gothic visuals, Tim Burton has so far been somewhat less prolific. Planet of the Apes was an expensive embarrassment, and Ed Wood is a decidedly acquired taste. Big Fish, then, is a new direction for him. Yes, it is eye candy, or perhaps even eye H"agen Dazs. But this time, the movie has much more of a soul than his monkeyplanet. This soul is achieved by two means: a great story (or collection of stories) and great acting. If you don't believe that the story is great, watch the audience. At key moments, everyone was chuckling or laughing, at others, I heard dozens of sniffs and tissues being unpacked around me. Yes, this is heartwarming stuff that a colder, more cynical soul would call cheese. Finally, Burton has found a story worthy of his talents again. And, better yet, he did not forget to encourage his cast to act. For a case study of such failure, see Christina Ricci's completely flat performance in Sleepy Hollow. In Big Fish, the cast is so carefully selected that failure is simply not an option. Ewan McGregor (playing the father in his youth) may not have much more to do than smile, be charming and sustain a Southern US accent, but he does it brilliantly.

This movie is also much more comfy about its pace - it takes its time just like a good storyteller would, but perhaps leaving behind the five-second-attention-span MTV generation kids in the process. On the other hand, I am tempted to say that its biggest vice is that there just isn't enough of it. Given the episodal structure of this movie, I can almost imagine what it would have felt like as TV series, or multi-part TV movie. I am not sure whether to wish for this to happen or shudder at the thought of "Big Fish: The Animated Series" or some such atrocity. Every story told in this movie is perfect, and a series of such perfect stories would be wonderful. Yet can perfection be sustained for a large number of stories?

Set presumably some time after Day of the Dead, the plot focuses on a human population that has managed to survive by barricading themselves within the "remains" of Pittsburgh by means of guards and electrified fences (as well as rivers that are bordering the city). The rich reside in a tower called Fiddler's Green but everyone else is forced to live in the streets, with only the false hope of being able to attain high-class status.\n\nOne guy dissatisfied with living in the streets, Cholo (John Leguizamo), doesn't take kindly to the mayor's (Dennis Hopper) refusal, especially having been his lackey for three years with the expectation of reward. So Cholo steals the armored vehicle Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy Fiddler's Green unless he gets his five million dollars (which is the amount needed to get high-class status, but did he really expect to be welcomed into Fiddler's Green with open arms after this incident?). Refusing to cooperate, the mayor hires Riley (Simon Baker) to bring Dead Reckoning back. Meanwhile, the undead are planning to invade the city thanks to the evolving zombie called Big Daddy, and given this couldn't happen at a worst possible time, you can guess what'll happen next.\n\nI'm going to put it bluntly, this film is by far the worst of Romero's zombie movies, lacking in so many ways that I would still feel the same way even if I didn't have its predecessors to compare it with. But there are its predecessors, and having already seen three prior films in which characters must hold off scores of zombies at bay from inside some "safe" location before it's ultimately penetrated by the undead, let's just say seeing this a fourth time gets a little repetitive.\n\nThe film does have elements worth appreciating, the cinematography is excellent and easily the best of the series; I especially loved the stylish and creepy nighttime shot of zombies shuffling within a fog-shrouded forest. The movie is also the most action-packed of the series, so the non-stop gunfire keeps the movie watchable. The production values are also pretty good considering the budgetary limitations (some of the f/x still look pretty weak, though).\n\nOtherwise, LOTD is rushed, unfulfilling, and does little its predecessors haven't already accomplished. What new material it does aim for is poorly conceived, a shocker considering Romero's had twenty years to mull over this material. Take the city, for instance, it's never fully explained how the monetary system works or where the electricity is coming from. I was able to suspend my disbelief for the latter in Dawn of the Dead, but I'm not willing to let Romero pull the same trick twice, especially when the inner workings of the city should have been further explored. \n\nThe movie's social commentary feels like a slapdash effort of contemporary issues tossed together without any real coherency, with characters acting in blatantly idiotic fashion for no other purpose than to continue serving the commentary. The original Dawn of the Dead's commentary on consumerism worked because it was a natural outgrowth of the way the characters' believably behaved (if you had free reign to a mall, you likely wouldn't want to leave, would you?).\n\nYet here, Romero feels compelled to ensure that Hopper's character won't dare negotiate, even preferring to leave the city (to go where exactly?) and kill an associate rather than give up five million bucks. To keep the commentary going, Romero even has Hopper take all his cash with him, even though I had to wonder what it was good for. Considering his demands, the same problem also applies to Cholo. Are there other cities/outposts out there using the same currency as well? If so, why not at least mention it so we don't question the characters' motivations, especially considering it's the basic framework that leads to so many deaths later in the film.\n\nThere are further instances of stupidity, such as Riley choosing not to warn anyone inside the city about Big Daddy. The soldiers protecting the city prove incompetent in almost every fashion, with one guard actually rappelling into a crowd of zombies. Later in the film, there's even a guy who wears headphones while he's outside the city, by himself, and not at all far from known zombie territory. This scene is also indicative of the countless jump scares Romero attempts, all of them obvious and hilariously overdone.\n\nAs for the zombies, there's the storyline involving Big Daddy, an undead gas station attendant who's inexplicably getting smarter. Much of the appeal of zombies is seeing them act out as mindless drones with no other motivation than to eat human flesh. That Big Daddy is able to think and seems to actually want revenge for his fallen zombie brethren completely mutes the sense of dread and terror that came with zombies acting on just pure instinct. \n\nMost astoundingly, Romero takes this a step further and actually wants us to sympathize with the zombies. I shouldn't be surprised by this development, as it's all been clearly leading up to this point since Bub's humanity in Day of the Dead and the constant "they're us, we're them" lines. Doesn't mean I have to like it, especially when the previous installments have made it clear being a zombie isn't something to cherish and the general fact that they like to eat people doesn't exactly make me want to side with them. For me, LOTD continues Romero's downward spiral, and I still haven't liked a movie of his since the 80s."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94659,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-08-24","keywords":"zombie apocalypse,post apocalypse,zombie film,zombie survival,survival horror","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Land of the Dead","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1419051289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODZhYWUxMDQtNWMzOC00ZjM2LWI2ZWEtNjliNzU5YjEwYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODZhYWUxMDQtNWMzOC00ZjM2LWI2ZWEtNjliNzU5YjEwYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000491/","name":"John Leguizamo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000782/","name":"Asia Argento"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048932/","name":"Simon Baker"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

The Director's cut should have been the official version of the movie, the theatrical cut is a poor excuse.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":276086,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-05-04","keywords":"crusader,12th century,jerusalem,templar,knights templar","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Kingdom of Heaven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2492727577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M3MmM0NWYtZTQyYi00NzllLTk3YmEtZDMwZDQyZjk2NTM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M3MmM0NWYtZTQyYi00NzllLTk3YmEtZDMwZDQyZjk2NTM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089217/","name":"Orlando Bloom","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1200692/","name":"Eva Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323361/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1184258/","name":"William Monahan"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?\n\nThis film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I'm still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I'd say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the "real" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That's a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn't even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento's soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.\n\nI have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there's some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out "form of a gundam" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn't been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn't. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky ("Oh God, it's f*%@ing Chucky" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).\n\nBut to say that this is nothing but leaching off others' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.\n\nThe characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \n\n And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"player,based on novel,screenplay adapted by author,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

By S4 mid-point, its turned into the most dreadful, ham-acted, soap opera where the artifact mysteries are largely overwhelmed by the childish acting - especially Pete who appears to have gone from being slightly immature macho man to an emotional 7yrs old. He reminds me a lot of Seeley Booth in Bones on a bad acting day.\n\nEven Myky is suffering from the same affliction - she was the sensible one and now is hyper/silly girl which doesn't sit well.

The Purgers (lead by Rhys Wakefield) drastically try to break into the family's home causing James (Ethan Hawke) and Mary (Lena Headey) to protect their children from the invaders in order to survive the night. \n\nThe main problem with the film is the premise itself, whilst interesting is filled with flaws and holes that just make the whole idea ridiculous. Such as what happens to the serial killers and career criminals of this world? Do they just control their urges to kill or steal for the other 364 days until the next Purge, as well what if someone has a heart attack on the night of The Purge? Is it just a case of bad luck you chose the wrong night to need medical care?\n\nDespite the flaws of the premise, the film repeatedly ignores the possibilities of the premise, instead of exploring the ideas behind the Purge or the events that occur on the night of the Purge from different perspectives and situations. Instead the film settles for a typical home invasion story that although done well, is nothing we haven't seen done in many other films. The Purge in the end seems to only be the premise of this film to stop the age old question of "Why don't they just call the police?" in home invasion films. \n\nTo the films credit it is quite subtle, there's a running theme that the Purge is just an excuse for the upper classes to exterminate the poor, driven by all the attackers wearing prep school blazers and the person they are chasing wearing dog tags around his neck. The film also contains some strong performances, especially from Ethan Hawke (Training Day, Lord of War) and Lena Headey (Dredd, Game of Thrones) who carry the film throughout. The film also has a twist near the end which allows the audience to get inside the heads of the people during this night. \n\nThat cant be said for the leader of the Purger's played by Rhys Wakefield (Sanctum, Home and Away)whose performance is slightly cringe worthy, hes trying to be psychotic yet in control of the proceedings but it just comes across as a amateur dramatics' version of The Joker. He just never seems like a really threat and just a creepy next door neighbour. \n\nThe film also contains some bizarre and just plain weird set pieces, such as the families' son who builds a spy camera on a chard baby doll on the top of a rhino tank from Warhammer 40,000.

 --- Description: The Purge: Directed by James DeMonaco. With Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane. A wealthy family is held hostage for harboring the target of a murderous syndicate during the Purge, a 12-hour period in which any and all crime is legal." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt2184339/","name":"The Purge","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNTcwODEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM1MDI0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A wealthy family is held hostage for harboring the target of a murderous syndicate during the Purge, a 12-hour period in which any and all crime is legal.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt2184339/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"dannyobrien247","dateCreated":"2013-06-10","inLanguage":"English","name":"Wasted potential, just a generic home invasion film.","reviewBody":"From the producers of Paranormal Activity (as is all horror films these days) The Purge tells the story of a near future were crime is at an all time low and unemployment stands at under 1% of the US population, to compensate for one night a year all crime (including murder) is legal for 12 hours allowing society some kind of release. \n\nThe film revolves around the Sandin family who are confronted by a group of college students hunting a man on the night of the Purge who the family had allowed into their home after lockdown. The Purgers (lead by Rhys Wakefield) drastically try to break into the family's home causing James (Ethan Hawke) and Mary (Lena Headey) to protect their children from the invaders in order to survive the night. \n\nThe main problem with the film is the premise itself, whilst interesting is filled with flaws and holes that just make the whole idea ridiculous. Such as what happens to the serial killers and career criminals of this world? Do they just control their urges to kill or steal for the other 364 days until the next Purge, as well what if someone has a heart attack on the night of The Purge? Is it just a case of bad luck you chose the wrong night to need medical care?\n\nDespite the flaws of the premise, the film repeatedly ignores the possibilities of the premise, instead of exploring the ideas behind the Purge or the events that occur on the night of the Purge from different perspectives and situations. Instead the film settles for a typical home invasion story that although done well, is nothing we haven't seen done in many other films. The Purge in the end seems to only be the premise of this film to stop the age old question of "Why don't they just call the police?" in home invasion films. \n\nTo the films credit it is quite subtle, there's a running theme that the Purge is just an excuse for the upper classes to exterminate the poor, driven by all the attackers wearing prep school blazers and the person they are chasing wearing dog tags around his neck. The film also contains some strong performances, especially from Ethan Hawke (Training Day, Lord of War) and Lena Headey (Dredd, Game of Thrones) who carry the film throughout. The film also has a twist near the end which allows the audience to get inside the heads of the people during this night. \n\nThat cant be said for the leader of the Purger's played by Rhys Wakefield (Sanctum, Home and Away)whose performance is slightly cringe worthy, hes trying to be psychotic yet in control of the proceedings but it just comes across as a amateur dramatics' version of The Joker. He just never seems like a really threat and just a creepy next door neighbour. \n\nThe film also contains some bizarre and just plain weird set pieces, such as the families' son who builds a spy camera on a chard baby doll on the top of a rhino tank from Warhammer 40,000. The thing looks like a demented contraption from Sid's bedroom in Toy Story. \n\nOverall, The Purge is an OK home invasion film, there are moments of suspense and a couple of jump scares are effective. The wasted potential of the premise is the films main downfall which could have lead to a more effective and possible original film then what we got in the end.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":213943,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-26","keywords":"violence,killing spree,class differences,survival,suburb","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1893967385","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MTg1MDkwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE3MTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MTg1MDkwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE3MTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Given the country's overcrowded prisons, the U.S. government begins to allow 12-hour periods of time in which all illegal activity is legal.

Fortunately, I didn't get my hopes up, and therefore I wasn't disappointed. The movie has its fair share of flaws, don't get me wrong. However, the movie made this Saw fan happy because it maintained the spirit of the series. The movie's biggest flaw is that it is by far the most unrealistic of the series and relies too much on chance within the story. Too many events are contingent on others, which makes Jigsaw look almost clairvoyant. However, I was able to look past this and enjoy the fourth Saw film.\n\nJigsaw (Tobin Bell) is dead. Though he is gone, he vows that his work will continue. And it appears he is true to his word, for SWAT Lt. Rigg (from Saw 2 &amp; 3) is the latest member of the police force to be thrust into one of Jigsaw's deadly games. Meanwhile, Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is joined by a pair of FBI agents to help stop the Jigsaw killer once and for all...They'll start by looking into his past, beginning with his ex wife, Jill.\n\nThe acting is pretty good. Costas Mandylor, Tobin Bell, and Scott Patterson are the standouts. Bell brings so much more to the character this time around through flashbacks as we learn more about John Kramer. Showing that he has created one of the most memorable characters of recent memory, Bell makes us almost sympathize with him, despite the acts he has committed. Mandylor is really good as Detective Hoffman, even though he has limited screen time and dialog. I liked Patterson a lot because of the toughness and reality he brought to the character. Agent Strahm is a good character and definitely one of my favorites in the series. One big surprise was Lyric Bent as Rigg. He definitely showed a lot of range in this movie. He has a future.\n\nThe plot is probably the most complex, as there can be as many as 3 different subplots going on at the same time, all while the audience has questions from the first 3 movies answered. The ending also leaves a little to be desired, as it is the least impacting twist of the series (and most obvious). However, I really enjoyed the traps, which were definitely a step up from Saw 3. The random gore was kept to a minimum, but the beginning is absolutely horrifyingly gory. It also felt rushed, which means I can't wait to see the unrated DVD. Hopefully it'll have more extra footage than the others. Saw 4 has the weakest script of the series, but it's still better than I expected. At this point, it appears as if Darren Bousman is going through the motions, and that's what keeps the series spirit alive. As long as Bousman, Wan, or Whannell continue to be involved, the spirit should live on. I also have to give props to the editor for the smooth and catchy transitions, not to mention the production design is top notch. That and the lighting provide at least some horror realism, as the plot does border on absurd at times. The sound is better than ever, with the classic 'Hello, Zepp' tune that has become one of the most recognizable tracks in movie history making its dramatic appearance in the climax of the film. The ending also leaves us wanting more, so I'm expecting Saw 5 next Halloween.\n\n8/10 --spy","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":145953,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2007-11-21","keywords":"serial rapist,ex wife,tied to a chair,bound and gagged,brutality","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Saw IV Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3031499033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI4MjgzNjI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI4MjgzNjI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Saw IV Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068551/","name":"Tobin Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0666398/","name":"Scott Patterson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274371/","name":"Louis Ferreira"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1135423/","name":"Darren Lynn Bousman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0137447/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0184201/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0786360/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1733317/","name":"Patrick Melton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1729303/","name":"Marcus Dunstan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272090/","name":"Thomas Fenton"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

By S4 mid-point, its turned into the most dreadful, ham-acted, soap opera where the artifact mysteries are largely overwhelmed by the childish acting - especially Pete who appears to have gone from being slightly immature macho man to an emotional 7yrs old. He reminds me a lot of Seeley Booth in Bones on a bad acting day.\n\nEven Myky is suffering from the same affliction - she was the sensible one and now is hyper/silly girl which doesn't sit well. These two are meant to be top notch Secret Service agents in their late 20s for heaven's sake, not Buffy extras.\n\nI can only assume the writing team has changed, or the producers are aiming at a younger/less demanding demographic. Whatever is going on - I certainly won't be tuning in to see the rest of S4 if it carries on like this.\n\nWhat a pity.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50056,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-07-07","keywords":"occult detective,supernatural power,artifact,steampunk,shared universe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565858/","name":"Eddie McClintock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1162399/","name":"Joanne Kelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007210/","name":"Saul Rubinek"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242101/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0282285/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0260870/","name":"Jane Espenson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609315/","name":"D.

But why?","reviewBody":"Before renting "All the boys love Mandy Lane", I saw its trailer in the YouTube to check it out. Good cameras, interesting story and there were some good reviews in IMDb. Well, maybe I was in for a surprise. You never know. So I took the risk and rented the film. But in the first moments of the film, I noticed that this one was not different at all - it was just another brick in the wall.\n\nTo begin with, apart from the differences of sex and looks there's nothing to really differentiate the characters in this film. Other films are able to provide simple characters (even if one-dimensional ones) with whom we can identify with. This film gives us a very superficial glimpse of the characters, their relationships, conflicts.. What we see in "All the boys love Mandy Lane" is just a bunch of stereotyped American teenagers like we've seen so many times before.\n\nAnd how is Mandy Lane? Mandy Lane, as portrayed by Amber Heard, is just your typical high school girl. There are many girls like her - in any high school there are dozens of Mandy Lanes. Amber Heard has nothing really distinctive about her. She's pretty, that's all. Then, why do all the boys love Mandy Lane? This is a film, that's why.\n\nThat said, let's go to the film. As you well know, all the guys are mad about Mandy Lane. The boys (with the help of the girls) prepare a party. Mandy Lane is invited to this party. The party is to take place in an isolated ranch. No one had succeeded till now in scoring Mandy. The objective of this party is to ease things out. A girl in the group wants to make it with a guy, there are rivalries, frustrations, and last but not least, there's someone that loves Mandy so much that he/she is ready to kill for her. But make no mistake, anyone will guess from the beginning who the killer is, but prepare yourself for a wild twist that will put everything upside down.\n\nIf the script had managed to give us flesh and body characters and describe in more detail the relationship among the characters (their emotions, their conflicts...), this film could have been a memorable slasher teen flick. Had the film been done in the right way, there would be in it a growing sense of fear, of encirclement. Conflicts, fights, suspicion, and death advancing on and on.. outside just the empty fields... but the film is unable to build up the suspense. \n\n"All the boys love Mandy Lane" is just a passable entertainment and nothing more. If you want to see a film with more substance try "High Tension" (Haute Tension), a very good french slasher flick.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32321,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-10-15","keywords":"female nudity,teenage sexuality,mystery killer,cheerleader practice,serial killer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1243326745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1MTE4NTMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcyNzAxMDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1MTE4NTMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcyNzAxMDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A group of high-schoolers invite Mandy Lane, a good girl who became quite hot over the summer, to a weekend party on a secluded ranch.
