Boy, was I surprised. This is a wonderful film, not at all the low-level fluff film I expected. All the female actresses, young and old, are absolutely terrific, and Adam Sandler does a respectable job in a semi-serious role. The writing is very clever, and the film will elicit laughter as well as tears.

People wanted more out of Donnie Yen and Wilson Yip. They wanted more of the same: martial-arts action-laden sequences carefully woven around an old-fashioned moral lesson about martial arts. And that is exactly what Yen, Yip and company have made here: a sequel which is surprisingly as solid as the first.\n\nAs per the first film, Donnie Yen once again proves that he can act AND fight at the same time. He is perfect as the wise sifu Ip Man and he acts rationally without ever losing control of himself. Even when he gets angry. Now that is a true man. His fighting skills prove that in spades.\n\nThe supporting actors are a mixed bag. On one hand we have the Chinese actors giving their best, including Sammo Hung in a memorable role as a fellow martial-arts master. However, the British actors are the ones I'm complaining about, some of their acting is just overdone and hammy. But the action still overlays this flaw. One part I did like about this sequel though; a villain in the previous film now becomes a like-able friend in this one. The reason? He found a family and humbled down, realizing his foolish mistakes in the past. This is proof that this movie is not all-action, but it has a big heart as well.\n\nAgain, the story is nothing new to write home about; it's basically the Hong Kong version of "Rocky IV", with Donne Yen playing "Ip Man" which is equivalent to Stallone's iconic character, and a very buffed-up Darren Shahlavi playing a British boxer which is the equivalent of Dolph Lundgren's "Ivan Drago" character. However the direction and the fight scenes are executed so masterfully that it makes the story easy to relate to.\n\nOnce again, his fists move like a chain-gun firing without reloading. And as for Sammo Hung, if you think that a fat guy can't fight, think again. Sammo Hung moves at breathtaking speed and it's a marvel watching Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung duking it out on the big screen. The martial-arts action sequences reaches new heights of excitement, and the adrenaline level of anyone watching them will be spiked. Then again, it has it's fair share of realism in it as well. Donnie almost gets the crap beaten up of him at one point, making his character all but human just like the rest of us.\n\nOverall, it is a fine martial-arts movie, with good acting, a good ol' fashioned moral tale and lots of exceptional fight sequences that will leave you breathless. It's one Asian blockbuster not to be missed.

While there have been many other "Ip Man" movies produced by other film companies, other teams and directors, Peagasus Motion Pictures have declared that these have no relations to Donnie Yen's Ip Man trilogy. The other Ip Man movies have been mediocre at best, in terms of both critical and commercial success.\n\nThe truth is the Ip Man trilogy is like the Dark Knight trilogy. While Dark Knight(2008) was so good, people were thinking how Dark Knight Rises(2012) can surpass that, and expectations were Sky-High. Similarly, our expectations of Ip Man 3 is at an all time high, due to the hugely enjoyable Ip Man(2008) and Ip Man 2(2010).\n\nWas the Dark Knight Rises a good movie? Definitely. But when expectations are high, and compared to Dark Knight(2008), people left the cinema disappointed.\n\nThis is where the difference comes in, director Wilson Yip and Producer Raymond Wong took a risk. They decided to go for a different direction with Ip Man 3, a stark contrast from Ip Man 1 and 2. Instead of Nationalist Pride, the main focus of Ip Man 3 is human emotion and melodrama. Instead of just realistic fight scenes, Yuen Woo Ping(Iron Monkey, Matrix, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) was brought in to add "beauty" and "detail" into every fight scene? So what is the result? A beautiful film in its own right, which may spark differences in opinion between people who understood the film, and people who don't.\n\nFans who are not used to Yuen Woo Ping's style will find the action weaker than Ip Man 1 and 2. But fans who look at details, and understanding of Martial Arts will enjoy Yuen's style much more than Sammo Hung, be it water droplets fading upon reaching the ground, glass causing balloon string to snap, "One-inch punch" finish, we are looking at extreme details and incredible beauty of martial arts, which have NEVER been present in Ip Man 1 and 2.\n\nDirector Wilson Yip's way of expressing his ideas in Ip Man 3 is that much deeper than previous films. Be it hinting "Be like water", or the first scene of "Butterfly"(a Chinese mythology of a returning spirit of a love one, key hint to subsequent events in the film), there are many details which ordinary viewers might overlook, but observant viewers will fall in love with the film.\n\nNow, refocusing back on Donnie Yen. Many fans will be watching Ip Man 3 simply because Donnie is back as Ip Man, and to many people... "Donnie Yen IS Ip Man", and there have been voices of boycott of other unrelated Yip Mun films starring other actors.\n\nFor fans of Donnie Yen, his performance will not disappoint you. His performance as a grounded, highly-skilled martial artist continue to impress, but its his work as a father and as a husband that will stay in our hearts forever. Ip Man is willing to give up his cigarette addiction for his family, and to give up any prestige and reputation for his son(when he was kidnapped) and his wife(to spend more time with her).\n\nDonnie's performance in his movie alone, is capable of leaving audiences in tears in the cinema. His jokes in the films are excellent, while his emotional scenes touch the hearts of every audience.\n\nTo sum it all up, Ip Man 3 is the excellent and perhaps perfect ending to the Ip Man trilogy. But one needs to use his/her heart to understand, and use their eyes to observe.. not just the fight scenes, but every emotional scene.\n\nIp Man 3 has improved dramatically from the previous 2 installments, due to the additional of love stories and humour, besides incredible action by Yuen Woo Ping.\n\nWhile many is claiming that Ip Man 3 is the best of the trilogy, I will not go so far as that. I personally felt that Ip Man 3 is definitely better than Ip Man 2, and is definitely on par with Ip Man(2008).\n\nIp Man 3 and its previous 2 installments will definitely become classics, and Ip Man 3 will be a film we still talk about for decades to come, just like the Dark Knight Trilogy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52958,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-12-24","keywords":"wing chun,hong kong,bruce lee character,ip man character,martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ip Man 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3286219289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjM3ZTA4ZDUtNTQ1NS00OWQxLTg0YzUtZDc3N2JkN2NmZjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjM3ZTA4ZDUtNTQ1NS00OWQxLTg0YzUtZDc3N2JkN2NmZjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Ip Man 3"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0947447/","name":"Donnie Yen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3237713/","name":"Lynn Xiong"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1018221/","name":"Jin Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0948159/","name":"Wilson Yip"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015592/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0560592/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323668/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5335213/","name":"Tai-lee Chan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4183613/","name":"Lai-Yin Leung"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2774833/","name":"Edmond Wong"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While there have been many other "Ip Man" movies produced by other film companies, other teams and directors, Peagasus Motion Pictures have declared that these have no relations to Donnie Yen's Ip Man trilogy. The other Ip Man movies have been mediocre at best, in terms of both critical and commercial success.\n\nThe truth is the Ip Man trilogy is like the Dark Knight trilogy. While Dark Knight(2008) was so good, people were thinking how Dark Knight Rises(2012) can surpass that, and expectations were Sky-High. Similarly, our expectations of Ip Man 3 is at an all time high, due to the hugely enjoyable Ip Man(2008) and Ip Man 2(2010).\n\nWas the Dark Knight Rises a good movie? Definitely. But when expectations are high, and compared to Dark Knight(2008), people left the cinema disappointed.\n\nThis is where the difference comes in, director Wilson Yip and Producer Raymond Wong took a risk. They decided to go for a different direction with Ip Man 3, a stark contrast from Ip Man 1 and 2. Instead of Nationalist Pride, the main focus of Ip Man 3 is human emotion and melodrama. Instead of just realistic fight scenes, Yuen Woo Ping(Iron Monkey, Matrix, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) was brought in to add "beauty" and "detail" into every fight scene? So what is the result? A beautiful film in its own right, which may spark differences in opinion between people who understood the film, and people who don't.\n\nFans who are not used to Yuen Woo Ping's style will find the action weaker than Ip Man 1 and 2. But fans who look at details, and understanding of Martial Arts will enjoy Yuen's style much more than Sammo Hung, be it water droplets fading upon reaching the ground, glass causing balloon string to snap, "One-inch punch" finish, we are looking at extreme details and incredible beauty of martial arts, which have NEVER been present in Ip Man 1 and 2.\n\nDirector Wilson Yip's way of expressing his ideas in Ip Man 3 is that much deeper than previous films. Be it hinting "Be like water", or the first scene of "Butterfly"(a Chinese mythology of a returning spirit of a love one, key hint to subsequent events in the film), there are many details which ordinary viewers might overlook, but observant viewers will fall in love with the film.\n\nNow, refocusing back on Donnie Yen. Many fans will be watching Ip Man 3 simply because Donnie is back as Ip Man, and to many people... "Donnie Yen IS Ip Man", and there have been voices of boycott of other unrelated Yip Mun films starring other actors.\n\nFor fans of Donnie Yen, his performance will not disappoint you. His performance as a grounded, highly-skilled martial artist continue to impress, but its his work as a father and as a husband that will stay in our hearts forever. Ip Man is willing to give up his cigarette addiction for his family, and to give up any prestige and reputation for his son(when he was kidnapped) and his wife(to spend more time with her).\n\nDonnie's performance in his movie alone, is capable of leaving audiences in tears in the cinema. His jokes in the films are excellent, while his emotional scenes touch the hearts of every audience.\n\nTo sum it all up, Ip Man 3 is the excellent and perhaps perfect ending to the Ip Man trilogy. But one needs to use his/her heart to understand, and use their eyes to observe.. not just the fight scenes, but every emotional scene.\n\nIp Man 3 has improved dramatically from the previous 2 installments, due to the additional of love stories and humour, besides incredible action by Yuen Woo Ping.\n\nWhile many is claiming that Ip Man 3 is the best of the trilogy, I will not go so far as that. I personally felt that Ip Man 3 is definitely better than Ip Man 2, and is definitely on par with Ip Man(2008).\n\nIp Man 3 and its previous 2 installments will definitely become classics, and Ip Man 3 will be a film we still talk about for decades to come, just like the Dark Knight Trilogy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52958,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-12-24","keywords":"wing chun,hong kong,bruce lee character,ip man character,martial arts","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ip Man 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3286219289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjM3ZTA4ZDUtNTQ1NS00OWQxLTg0YzUtZDc3N2JkN2NmZjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjM3ZTA4ZDUtNTQ1NS00OWQxLTg0YzUtZDc3N2JkN2NmZjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Ip Man 3","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0947447/","name":"Donnie Yen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3237713/","name":"Lynn Xiong","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1018221/","name":"Jin Zhang"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0948159/","name":"Wilson Yip"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015592/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0560592/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323668/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5335213/","name":"Tai-lee Chan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4183613/","name":"Lai-Yin Leung","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2774833/","name":"Edmond Wong"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Why? After Daredevil, Blade, Elektra, Aeon Flux, League of extraordinary gentlemen, Spiderman (yes, i mean it), Spawn, etc etc there are many parallels you can draw between superhero films. And Hulk is the only thing that the others aren't: un-American! In a very rare exception we have a film here that doesn't have the arrogance and straight-forward story that we seem to have gotten used to too easily.\n\nSpiderman (in particular) follows the EXACT steps you can read in a tutorial for film making - that may be neat to watch but leaves no space for surprises or artistic inputs. Ang Lee seems to have taken especially this thought very seriously and created a piece of art that the average pop-corn-formula-film-liking movie-goer may find hard to digest. No doubt, this movie is not made for assembly-line-film-lovers - it is constructed very thoughtfully and goes beyond the interpretation of a superhero. It plays with the chaos that erupts out of the events rather than glorifying another world saviour.\n\nThere is no real good and evil, there only is an overcharge from both sides that don't know how to master the situation. The American movie-goer averagely wants black and white sides, a proud US-flag waving and a hero that saves the day (+nation and eventually the world, maybe even the universe). Nope, not in this one. While most of the other films establish superheroes as something that fits perfectly into our society, Hulk plays with the idea of what would happen if unknown uncontrolled untameable power surfaces - and that both sides act incredibly humane. At this point 80% of movie-consumers are out and 90% of movie-lovers come in (that number is small as we know).\n\nI appreciated the rather unconventional storytelling, I admire the cast, I treasure the artistic hybrid of comic and reality and I enjoyed the portrayal of energy. Now, anyone who has seen Asian action films will find many parallels - the question is, are YOU ready to adapt to some of those standards when they are being poured over a western story? I was...

Why? After Daredevil, Blade, Elektra, Aeon Flux, League of extraordinary gentlemen, Spiderman (yes, i mean it), Spawn, etc etc there are many parallels you can draw between superhero films. And Hulk is the only thing that the others aren't: un-American! In a very rare exception we have a film here that doesn't have the arrogance and straight-forward story that we seem to have gotten used to too easily.\n\nSpiderman (in particular) follows the EXACT steps you can read in a tutorial for film making - that may be neat to watch but leaves no space for surprises or artistic inputs. Ang Lee seems to have taken especially this thought very seriously and created a piece of art that the average pop-corn-formula-film-liking movie-goer may find hard to digest. No doubt, this movie is not made for assembly-line-film-lovers - it is constructed very thoughtfully and goes beyond the interpretation of a superhero. It plays with the chaos that erupts out of the events rather than glorifying another world saviour.\n\nThere is no real good and evil, there only is an overcharge from both sides that don't know how to master the situation. The American movie-goer averagely wants black and white sides, a proud US-flag waving and a hero that saves the day (+nation and eventually the world, maybe even the universe). Nope, not in this one. While most of the other films establish superheroes as something that fits perfectly into our society, Hulk plays with the idea of what would happen if unknown uncontrolled untameable power surfaces - and that both sides act incredibly humane. At this point 80% of movie-consumers are out and 90% of movie-lovers come in (that number is small as we know).\n\nI appreciated the rather unconventional storytelling, I admire the cast, I treasure the artistic hybrid of comic and reality and I enjoyed the portrayal of energy. Now, anyone who has seen Asian action films will find many parallels - the question is, are YOU ready to adapt to some of those standards when they are being poured over a western story? I was... And I was overwhelmed!\n\nAnyone calling this movie the worst film they've ever seen (and there are quite few stating this) should stay with Spiderman, Transformers and Blade and get the same product over and over again (because they keep buying it). For my part I was grateful to see that there are people out there who get the chance to put a very distinctive stamp on their work making it unique and deep.\n\nFive years later the audience won and an assembly line version was released, not as bad as some others but definitely not as creative and visionary as this one.

Only in space. In the distant, distant future, a ship has been sent from the Earth carrying a lot of people, headed to the only Earth-like planet ever found. Sometime during the journey, things go awry. We pick up the story as an astronaut named Bower (Ben Foster) awakens from hypersleep, abruptly; he's soon followed by his commanding officer, Payton (Dennis Quaid). The rest of the crew is gone, and the only door is locked from the outside. What's happened here? Making matters more difficult is the amnesia that each man suffers from, owing to their having been in hypersleep way longer than intended. Somehow, they must piece together what has happened and find out what lies behind that door - and throughout the rest of the gigantic ship.\n\nNot only does the movie recall Aliens and 2001, you can also see similarities to The Descent and The Abyss; really, any movie in which people are trapped in claustrophobic environs. And although the pacing is frenetic at times, the movie is really chillingly shot (by Wedigo von Schultzendorff). On the one hand, the plot flows linearly - Bower needs to get to the ship's reactor so he can reboot it and save everyone - meaning that the actors race from scene to scene, running out of time. On the other hand, they don't piece together what's happened as quickly as they might in other, lesser films; they seem to figure things out gradually, as if assembling a puzzle in their heads. Bowers and others - and there are others - discover right away, though, that they're not really alone on the ship and that their enemies are extremely strong and fast and vicious.\n\nInjected into this oh-my-goodness-what's-out-there madness is, well, madness. The movie's title is explained as being a sort of mental illness that affects astronauts from time to time, when they just plain go bonkers for seemingly no reason and kill everyone on board. Is that's what's happening here? Is Bower the crazy one? Or is it Payton? Are they, in fact, alone on the ship? Foster is excellent as the hero who remembers a little bit more of their mission as time elapses; Quaid, in turn, shows a few more layers than we're accustomed to seeing from him (he's usually more of a poor man's Harrison Ford). Both actors turn in convincing, full-throated performances that complement, rather than succumb to, the special effects and cinematic wizardry. Often, the effects are the entire show. Now, it's true that you won't see a lot of character development here, as you might in the most cerebral of sci-fi, but what works best here is the paucity of knowledge about the situation and the characters. By spinning the tale gradually, feeding the audience only a snippet at a time, director Christian Alvart dangles the mystery in front of his viewers without allowing them to settle back and solve the mystery on their own. When you're constantly kept on your toes with sudden lurches of unseen shapes and reverberating noises, you - like the befuddled characters - are concurrently kept off balance.

It's really unusual, as the novel is. It's generally difficult to convey something like a SMELL in a book or a movie, and it's also difficult to create a satisfying adaption of a novel. So my personal opinion is that The Parfume Movie is one of the few good adaptations, because it eagerly tries to convey the complicated world of smells and the world of Grenouille and also achieves it in many ways. There are of course some parts missing or changed if you compare novel and movie, but that is always the case with adaptations.\n\nI saw the movie one hour ago and have just read some comments.

It's really unusual, as the novel is. It's generally difficult to convey something like a SMELL in a book or a movie, and it's also difficult to create a satisfying adaption of a novel. So my personal opinion is that The Parfume Movie is one of the few good adaptations, because it eagerly tries to convey the complicated world of smells and the world of Grenouille and also achieves it in many ways. There are of course some parts missing or changed if you compare novel and movie, but that is always the case with adaptations.\n\nI saw the movie one hour ago and have just read some comments. Some of them are "disappointed" or "boooring", but most of these opinions are really not well founded, so I couldn't make out what EXACTLY was so boring and disappointing...

The story, about friendship and loneliness and also society as it was then, is good of course even if it is slightly modified. But I do not care if it is, for the actors are good and the filmmaking is too. I especially like William Takaku (Friday). He is very good and plays his role perfectly and he is of course in the best scenes of the movie, which actually doesn't start until Crusoe meets Friday. Before that meeting there are some scenes of lesser quality. But there are far more good or very good scenes, favourite scenes are: the burial, the readying of the boat, the last fight scene on the island, the last shot plus the afterwards inserted text and especially the DUEL at the end.\n\n 7 out of 10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12274,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1997-06-12","keywords":"female removes her clothes,striptease,female rear nudity,female nudity,stranded on an island","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Robinson Crusoe","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1037082137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzA1NGYyNTQtYzk3OC00NDY4LTg0MTEtZTM4ZTA1YjNjODQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzA1NGYyNTQtYzk3OC00NDY4LTg0MTEtZTM4ZTA1YjNjODQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0847261/","name":"William Takaku","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0908116/","name":"Polly Walker"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362738/","name":"Rod Hardy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004305/","name":"George Miller"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013824/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214518/","name":"Daniel Defoe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0517465/","name":"Christopher Lofton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0944003/","name":"Tracy Keenan Wynn"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It would have made this more than just a typical Dreamworks film, but it doesn't matter because the movie is definitely suppose to be delightful for the entire family. It still takes some clever points. It's also great to see a load of spectacular animation. It is indeed truly enjoyable and full of life. The Croods is far from classic but this is kind of film that would enjoy anytime.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":203577,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"caveman,journey,cavewoman,elderly woman,family character name as title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi126265113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The world's very first prehistoric family goes on a road trip to an uncharted and fantastical world.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000092/","name":"John Cleese"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I finished watching it and had very mixed feelings. First off, this film is not nearly as gory and disgusting as advertised. It is although, very graphic, and NOT for the squeamish, I just expected more out of it. The pop-up scares aren't effective and the first half of the movie is all soft-core porn. So what makes this movie a decent horror movie? The physiological scares. That is what got to me. The overwhelming feeling of being tied and up and tortured to death. Having no escape.

I finished watching it and had very mixed feelings. First off, this film is not nearly as gory and disgusting as advertised. It is although, very graphic, and NOT for the squeamish, I just expected more out of it. The pop-up scares aren't effective and the first half of the movie is all soft-core porn. So what makes this movie a decent horror movie? The physiological scares. That is what got to me. The overwhelming feeling of being tied and up and tortured to death. Having no escape. For that was very effective and stomach curdling. The sex and nudity was all not needed, but for people looking for that kind of stuff, it's all here. The acting was pretty good. No bad performances.

Hopefully this will be a good calling card for him to get more work, or for more of his comics to reach the screen. While he's usually known for his spin on Captain America, he also has a series of hard-hitting hard-boiled comics called 'Criminal' (at the moment, I think, there's three volumes in all). Angel of Death follows along on the heels of those latter comics, and what he delivers here with this script is like an updating of a pulpy story that might have been found back in the 1950s put to film - only, of course, far less violent and expletive or on occasion trippy. It's like a Sin City yarn if it took itself not quite as much as a parody. And it works, mostly.\n\nAnd another good thing about it, with its story about a hit-woman (Zoe Bell) who after getting a knife stabbed in her head and surviving- and becoming a loose cannon and seeing visions of a young girl she accidentally killed "telling her" to hit the entire mob organization around her- is that it leads on tough-movie dialog, kick-ass fight scenes and a really superb leading lady. Previously one could see Bell as a stunt-woman in Kill Bill or as herself, sorta, in Death Proof. But here she proves she can hold her own in dramatic scenes (maybe not quite her Uma Thurman counterpart but close enough) and seeing her fight is really extraordinary.\n\nIn fact, if you're just looking for a better-than-average direct-to-DVD action flick that chalks up a load of mob-movie/detective clichés, and don't know or care about Brubaker's name on the DVD, it's still worth watching. The fights are gritty and realistic, and the direction compliments these moments of torrid psycho-drama with Bell's knack for knocking someone's head in or any other kind of clever way of killing at a moment's notice. The film sometimes goes into a comic-book-panel kind of mis-en-scene, like if Zoe Bell's character is in a room walking around we'll see three different 'panels' of this. It's creative, if a little overused (and not so original if one's seen Ang Lee's Hulk). And, as a more obvious complaint, with the exception of Doug Jones and Lucy Lawless most of the cast is just 'meh', not terrible but nothing special.\n\nBut pick it up if you're roving around your video rental or if netflix gives the recommendation. You'll be surprised how much 78 minutes can go in delivering a hard-knock story of hard kills and harder consequences.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2276,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-07-07","keywords":"death in title,body lands on a car,knocked unconscious,assassin,mob","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Angel of Death","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1030208281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDM5NWQ5Y2MtNTI2Ny00YTRiLWFlNWMtMTYxM2I2YWY1MDA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDM5NWQ5Y2MtNTI2Ny00YTRiLWFlNWMtMTYxM2I2YWY1MDA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1057928/","name":"Zoë Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1831976/","name":"Jake Abel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2357552/","name":"Vail Bloom"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0262049/","name":"Paul Etheredge"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0178127/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3090268/","name":"Ed Brubaker"}],"duration":"PT1H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It has a lot less.\n\nIt's one of those movies that would have been great in 1998. But falls short in 2008. Its just the same gimmick that has been done by 'Happy Madison Productions'.\n\nReminds me of: Chuck and Larry, Strange Wilderness, The Benchwarmers, Dickie Roberts, 50 first dates, Etc.\n\nIt's just well.....for lack of a better word. Stupid. It might have you grabbing your sides in 98', but when you watch it, its somewhat like, "OK, let me guess, Rob Schneider is going to pop up and say something dumb with a 'pause for laughter' moment?"

Watched it on Netflix, just because I had nothing better to do. I didn't know anything about this beforehand - and that's the way this is meant to be watched. I was captivated, baffled, horrified and never did I guess what is going to happen next, not once. There are more or less subtle hints throughout the movie that not only shed some light on the bizarre ending but also keep building that disturbing mood that grows stronger and stronger as the movie progresses.\n\nWhy this is a hard film, for many, to watch:\n\n\n* It is extremely violent. This is not gore for gore's sake, this is brutal, dark and realistic violence that adds to the disturbing mood this movie sets. This is not enjoyable violence, this is gripping and shocking violence.\n\n\n\n* It gradually changes its tone from a crime story to something surreal, disturbing and mysterious. I loved that, the movie surprised me. The tonal shift won't please everyone.\n\n\n\n* The final act is bizarre and certainly does not clearly explain itself. While I was shocked and wanted to have more answers, I really thought that if a movie needs to have an ambiguous ending, this is the way you do it. There are hints along the way, but nothing is too clear or spoon-fed. For many, the ending is a dealbreaker or seals the deal. I loved this movie already before the final act, but there's no denying how powerful the ending is. Also, I'd like to say that there's so much quality in this movie that I really don't think the somewhat open ending is a product of lazy writing. I think it's the product of careful, genuinely good filmmaking. \n\n\nThe acting is phenomenal. Damn you Brits, you really sometimes surprise me. The characters feel like real people. Handling of music, cinematography, editing...you really can see how well this movie is crafted, seems like nothing is rushed or forced and many things are definitely missed on the first viewing. This might look like a cheap, unambitious film at first, but I really think it's quite the opposite. This is, in my mind, an intelligent film. Not a slasher, but an intelligent, shocking story.\n\nThis is a hard movie. Hard to watch because of the brutality, hard to totally comprehend because of the ambiguity. But it got me. I was thrilled all the way to the end. Possibly the most disturbing movie I've seen in years, and I've seen a lot of questionable stuff. I don't remember having such an emotional response to a movie for a long, long time. I don't know if I'm going to see it again, because it really disturbed me so much. But I know this: I was captivated, thoroughly at the mercy of this movie, and it didn't let me go.\n\nIf you like weird thrillers, check this one out.

Nothing more, nor less 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":143529,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"2003-09-24","keywords":"female police officer,swat team,police,crime boss,police sergeant","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"S.W.A.T.","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2894070041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDMzMGY1NGYtNWQ0Ni00NTU4LTlmNTYtMDZiNWJmMmI3NTk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDMzMGY1NGYtNWQ0Ni00NTU4LTlmNTYtMDZiNWJmMmI3NTk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Tristar","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

The L Word is back and it's not bad at all!","reviewBody":"The L Word changed my life. I was a very confused 14 year Colombian girl living in a very small city with my very Catholic family. I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show. Just don't watch it if you don't like it but you can't say it's not a great deal for our community and for us, lesbians.\n\nLesbian, from Lesbos. The origin of the L word is beautiful.

Stupid. It might have you grabbing your sides in 98', but when you watch it, its somewhat like, "OK, let me guess, Rob Schneider is going to pop up and say something dumb with a 'pause for laughter' moment?" Yup.\n\nIs Sandler going to do a stupid voice the whole movie and end on a 'touching theme'?. Yup.\n\nActing is good, I will give it that. However, if you have seen any Adam Sandler movie, then you won't be surprised with his acting choices. Same choices, different accent.\n\nNothing against Sandler, his movies were great.......in 98'\n\nI'd wait for DVD,...if that.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":196592,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-06-06","keywords":"hair stylist,palestinian,funny arab,arab israeli conflict,super strength","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"You Don't Mess with the Zohan","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1625489689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNjA5NjEwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEwODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNjA5NjEwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEwODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"You Don't Mess with the Zohan - 30 second spot"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001806/","name":"John Turturro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004825/","name":"Emmanuelle Chriqui"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0806912/","name":"Robert Smigel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It has a lot less.\n\nIt's one of those movies that would have been great in 1998. But falls short in 2008. Its just the same gimmick that has been done by 'Happy Madison Productions'.\n\nReminds me of: Chuck and Larry, Strange Wilderness, The Benchwarmers, Dickie Roberts, 50 first dates, Etc.\n\nIt's just well.....for lack of a better word. Stupid. It might have you grabbing your sides in 98', but when you watch it, its somewhat like, "OK, let me guess, Rob Schneider is going to pop up and say something dumb with a 'pause for laughter' moment?" Yup.\n\nIs Sandler going to do a stupid voice the whole movie and end on a 'touching theme'?. Yup.\n\nActing is good, I will give it that. However, if you have seen any Adam Sandler movie, then you won't be surprised with his acting choices. Same choices, different accent.\n\nNothing against Sandler, his movies were great.......in 98'\n\nI'd wait for DVD,...if that.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":196592,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-06-06","keywords":"hair stylist,palestinian,funny arab,arab israeli conflict,super strength","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"You Don't Mess with the Zohan","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1625489689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNjA5NjEwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEwODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNjA5NjEwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEwODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"You Don't Mess with the Zohan - 30 second spot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001806/","name":"John Turturro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004825/","name":"Emmanuelle Chriqui"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0806912/","name":"Robert Smigel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That movie took much (though not everything) of the best of the various Zorro films, serials, and series and then stole from other sources (such as Dumas 'Monte Cristo', etc) to concoct a sexy, swashbuckling action adventure that had great pacing and strengths, with high production values and actors. Mr. Campbell and those high standards at last return to the story begun, and we now follow our heroes and their son as California fights to join a struggling Union. Zorro's character is not quite so impulsive and cool as he once was, but simply comfortable and ultra-capable, while his wife Elena complains that the man behind the mask knows not who their son is growing up to be. None of these character 'upgrades' felt wrong to me; it was natural extensions of them from the first film, despite how adventurous Elena claims to still be (and for the most part isn't), but it does make the first act of this movie a bit tiresome after the initial (awesome) action sequence. This time, though, as the story and its many plot-points begin to move, the writers borrow heavily from Hitchcock to keep things interesting. It doesn't always work, as there's a lot going on but never QUITE coming perfectly, cohesively together, but ultimately it makes sense and spins a good yarn for the fighting to take over. Meanwhile the stunt coordinators take what has already been done in the best Zorro flicks and then go wild with it, giving us stunts and action of old-school-cool caliber, such as stage-coaches, leaps and horses jumping on to explosive-laden locomotives. Unfortunately there is not quite enough action, and while I do like the over-all story - with its subtle bits of murk and dirty grays underneath the battle of white and black hats - it doesn't actually pace perfectly, giving us bickering Vega family exploits and Zorro failures for a rather large portion of the picture. The sword fights are fewer and more far-between than I would have liked, sometimes degrading to fisticuffs instead of proper dicing, but then the explosions almost make up for it all. The humor is a bit silly, provided mostly by the horse(!!) and the sometimes-annoying kid, but the audience ate it up. The villains are good, if never entirely fleshed out, and the themes are handled well. It's the lag caused by the idea (which I never understood) that 'once a couple gets together they're not interesting anymore' that slows things. Regardless of my small issues, the movie DOES deliver as a Zorro film, (with a good ending, for certain) and while it doesn't completely live up to its predecessor, it is a worthy sequel - just not entirely the direction I would have gone.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98158,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-11-09","keywords":"abraham lincoln character,good versus evil,good man,good woman,four word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Legend of Zorro","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4092920089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMyZTUwNDMtZWQ2ZC00MjFhLWE5MzYtYTk3MDFlOTBiYTc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMyZTUwNDMtZWQ2ZC00MjFhLWE5MzYtYTk3MDFlOTBiYTc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001876/","name":"Catherine Zeta-Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001722/","name":"Rufus Sewell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0132709/","name":"Martin Campbell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132178/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0649460/","name":"Roberto Orci"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0476064/","name":"Alex Kurtzman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254645/","name":"Ted Elliott"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The animation was well done and the cat, Thunder carries the lead role well.\n\nIt does get a bit cliche with the villain, but then I guess we have to expect that.

Wahlberg also produced "Entourage" and the startling "In Treatment". He now produced "The Fighter" and his performance, interior and powerful, dominates the film allowing other members of the cast, to shine in truly showy roles, Christian Bale for instance - really good.

Starring Hilary Swank returns to the heights of a career that saw her win two Best Actress Oscars by the age of 30 . This is her most recent film , The Homesman in which she starred opposite Tommy Lee Jones , John Lithgow , Meryl Streep , James Spader , among others . Here Tommy Lee Jones's acting and direction are magnificent and remaining cast is pretty well , giving terrific performances . This above average film concerns about a pious , independent-minded woman called Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) is assigned by the village priest (John Lightow) to carry three women (Miranda Otto , Sonja Richter , and Grace Gummer , Meryl's Streep daughter) who have been driven mad by pioneer life . They have to be transported across the country by a covered wagon . The two-fisted woman obstinately carries out the dangerous assignment and in turn employs low-life drifter George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) to assist her . She forces the drifter for to a journey across the plains to locate the risked destination . Both of whom are determined to find the paths , through the prairies plagued by savage Indians , until the easy civilization . This journey will bring forward the stark contrast between the values of two ways of life and the landscape transversed is both geographical and emotional .\n\nThis enjoyable film is a touching and violent Western drama with elevated cinematographic values . The movie realizes an awesome actors reunion , showing the different characters and explores their apprehension , ambitions , fears and circumstances . The two protagonists result to be a pair ¨Quixotes¨ who obstinately undertake a trip whose objective looks to fulfill a pledge by whatever means . The main character George Briggs , superbly played by Tommy Lee Jones, seems to be living resolutely in the past and while the brave spinster wishes to marry him and create a family . Support cast is frankly excellent such as Barry Corbin , William Fichtner , Evan Jones , Jesse Plemons , Grace Gummer , Miranda Otto , and Tim Blake Nelson-James Spader, this duo previously appeared in ¨Lincoln¨ along with Tommy Lee and Hailee Steinfeld's second western after her Oscar-nominated , breakout role in ¨True Grit¨ . And , of course , the great Meryl Streep in her third collaboration with Tommy Lee Jones following "A Prairie Home Companion" and "Hope Springs . Intelligent and thoughtful screenplay by Kieran Fitzgerald , Wesley Oliver and the same Tommy Lee Jones , based on the novel by Glendon Swarthout that was published in 1988 ; in fact , Paul Newman owned the rights for a time, and wanted to direct the film himself , after a number of scripts, he gave up . Sensitive and evocative musical score by Marco Beltrani (Red eye , The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada) . Special mention for glimmer and fascinating cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto he splendidly reflects the impressive outdoors from the filming locations : Lumpkin , Georgia , San Miguel County , Santa Fe , Oikay Owinger Pueblo , New Mexico . Much of the movie was shot on Tommy Lee Jones's own ranch .\n\nThe film is a nice co-production , being produced , among others , by the great producer and director , the French Luc Besson . The picture was compellingly directed by Tommy Lee Jones , being his theatrical directing debut ¨The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada¨ that won a deserved prize in Cannes , this film bears a remarkable resemblance to ¨The Homesman¨ , dealing equally with a dangerous journey plenty of contrasts , attacks and many other things . His only other directing credits were the TV movies ¨Good old boys¨ (1995) and ¨The Sunset Limited¨ (2011) with Samuel L Jackson and all of them starred by Tommy Lee Jones . ¨Homesman¨ rating : Better than average , though overlong and slow-moving .

I really hope that Stefan Ruzowitzky will get the award, because his movie deserves it and it could help the Austrian film industry to finally get momentum again.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44766,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2007-03-22","keywords":"male full frontal nudity,male pubic hair,pubic hair,inmate,nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Counterfeiters","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2364539161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThmZDg1N2EtNmY5YS00NmNlLWFkZDAtNmRkM2E3MzIxYWFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThmZDg1N2EtNmY5YS00NmNlLWFkZDAtNmRkM2E3MzIxYWFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0548686/","name":"Karl Markovics","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0225944/","name":"August Diehl","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0834479/","name":"Devid Striesow"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0752328/","name":"Stefan Ruzowitzky"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0115545/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002528/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0128215/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2542195/","name":"Adolf Burger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0752328/","name":"Stefan Ruzowitzky"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A master of complex story telling his novels are often composed of characters standing around discussing complicated geo-political situations and the human condition . This means that his novels are fundamentally uncinematic , a fact reflected that so little of his work has been adapted to the silver screen . With this adaptation of his 1974 novel I doubt if anyone was expecting a James Bond thriller and I know I wasn't but even so you're struck as to how a Le Carre thriller doesn't lend itself to mainstream cinema \n\nYou can't fault the film for its production values . It contains a who's who of prestigious big hitting British character actors such as Oldman , Hurt and Firth alongside up and coming peers such as Hardy and Cumberbatch . We also get a host of under rated actors in Strong and Burke and at a casting level none of this can be faulted . The look of the film is fantastic with the brownish dull hues reflecting both Communist Eastern Europe and run down Britain in the early 1970s and a day after seeing the movie my abiding memory of the film is the cinematography \n\nThe problem is that - and I'm afraid to admit this - is that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time . A British agent is shot and caputured in Hungary and MI6 believes he was set up by a mole .

A master of complex story telling his novels are often composed of characters standing around discussing complicated geo-political situations and the human condition . This means that his novels are fundamentally uncinematic , a fact reflected that so little of his work has been adapted to the silver screen . With this adaptation of his 1974 novel I doubt if anyone was expecting a James Bond thriller and I know I wasn't but even so you're struck as to how a Le Carre thriller doesn't lend itself to mainstream cinema \n\nYou can't fault the film for its production values . It contains a who's who of prestigious big hitting British character actors such as Oldman , Hurt and Firth alongside up and coming peers such as Hardy and Cumberbatch . We also get a host of under rated actors in Strong and Burke and at a casting level none of this can be faulted . The look of the film is fantastic with the brownish dull hues reflecting both Communist Eastern Europe and run down Britain in the early 1970s and a day after seeing the movie my abiding memory of the film is the cinematography \n\nThe problem is that - and I'm afraid to admit this - is that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time . A British agent is shot and caputured in Hungary and MI6 believes he was set up by a mole . I understood this but then we cut to a character after character discussing who the mole might be , do we have a mole and we don't have a mole and very soon I was very lost . This film topped the film charts in Britain for a grand total of three weeks and one suspects by way of a backhanded compliment many people went to the cinema for a second and third time in order to unravel the plot .

I thought it would be just another well-acted period drama. What I didn't know was that Todd Haynes was behind it, and from the opening the film lets you know what kind of style it will be. It's not one of those stuffy period dramas. In fact, it's very much made in the style of actual 1950s films. It's apparently taking on the style of Douglas Sirks' films, and even though I have never seen one, the style is apparent. \n\nThis is the definition of a melodrama, but it serves the purpose completely and not the type of melodrama you would expect in this day and age. Everything is heightened in it's intensity. The incredible cinematography and use of colors is something to marvel at, and in terms of how the cinematography was constructed I don't think any other film could compare to. The beautiful music score is perfect and it only makes the atmosphere richer. All of this serves as a backdrop to a film that's really about contemporary issues in the 50s. That in itself has been the focus of many films in the last few years, but Far From Heaven stands apart from them all. The screenplay is brilliantly written, infusing rich backgrounds and characterization to all of the characters. In fact, the plot is pretty straight-forward and something you would see in classic films of that era, but now it feels fresh, alive with excitement. It's never depressing, and instead it tells its story until a satisfying conclusion. It's probably one of the best screenplays of its decade.\n\nThe performances are also perfect. But Julianne Moore tops off this perfection. I was surprised by how little "big" scenes she has. I would have expected this film to, but then again that's just another surprise. She embodies this character completely, and now that we have all of these flawed and unlikable leads, here we have one who we can easily call a "hero". Someone who others could look up to, we instantly connect with Moore. \n\nOverall, Far From Heaven is the 2nd Haynes film I have seen (the other being I'm Not There), and still his ambition is as apparent as ever. This feels as unique of a film as one could hope for."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45596,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-05-07","keywords":"gossip,homosexual,gay kiss,hate crime,domestic violence","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Far From Heaven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2359689497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEyMmEwOTUtOTk1Yi00YTU0LTg2YjktOTUzZTMwODJkOTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEyMmEwOTUtOTk1Yi00YTU0LTg2YjktOTUzZTMwODJkOTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Focus Features"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000598/","name":"Dennis Quaid"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0371660/","name":"Dennis Haysbert"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001331/","name":"Todd Haynes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042766/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030755/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001331/","name":"Todd Haynes"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A master of complex story telling his novels are often composed of characters standing around discussing complicated geo-political situations and the human condition . This means that his novels are fundamentally uncinematic , a fact reflected that so little of his work has been adapted to the silver screen . With this adaptation of his 1974 novel I doubt if anyone was expecting a James Bond thriller and I know I wasn't but even so you're struck as to how a Le Carre thriller doesn't lend itself to mainstream cinema \n\nYou can't fault the film for its production values . It contains a who's who of prestigious big hitting British character actors such as Oldman , Hurt and Firth alongside up and coming peers such as Hardy and Cumberbatch . We also get a host of under rated actors in Strong and Burke and at a casting level none of this can be faulted . The look of the film is fantastic with the brownish dull hues reflecting both Communist Eastern Europe and run down Britain in the early 1970s and a day after seeing the movie my abiding memory of the film is the cinematography \n\nThe problem is that - and I'm afraid to admit this - is that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time . A British agent is shot and caputured in Hungary and MI6 believes he was set up by a mole . I understood this but then we cut to a character after character discussing who the mole might be , do we have a mole and we don't have a mole and very soon I was very lost .

A master of complex story telling his novels are often composed of characters standing around discussing complicated geo-political situations and the human condition . This means that his novels are fundamentally uncinematic , a fact reflected that so little of his work has been adapted to the silver screen . With this adaptation of his 1974 novel I doubt if anyone was expecting a James Bond thriller and I know I wasn't but even so you're struck as to how a Le Carre thriller doesn't lend itself to mainstream cinema \n\nYou can't fault the film for its production values . It contains a who's who of prestigious big hitting British character actors such as Oldman , Hurt and Firth alongside up and coming peers such as Hardy and Cumberbatch . We also get a host of under rated actors in Strong and Burke and at a casting level none of this can be faulted . The look of the film is fantastic with the brownish dull hues reflecting both Communist Eastern Europe and run down Britain in the early 1970s and a day after seeing the movie my abiding memory of the film is the cinematography \n\nThe problem is that - and I'm afraid to admit this - is that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time . A British agent is shot and caputured in Hungary and MI6 believes he was set up by a mole . I understood this but then we cut to a character after character discussing who the mole might be , do we have a mole and we don't have a mole and very soon I was very lost . This film topped the film charts in Britain for a grand total of three weeks and one suspects by way of a backhanded compliment many people went to the cinema for a second and third time in order to unravel the plot . This is all well and good but illustrates the fact highly regarded novels often don't lend themselves to great cinema .

"The Danish Girl" is also in its way a film about torture, but more akin to the mental torture seen in films like "Buried" or "Flightpath". What must it be like to be trapped with a sexual orientation that you feel is not your own? To possess physical body parts you don't believe you should have? And all in a time (the 1920's) when an exposed ankle was considered slightly daring.\n\nBased on a true story, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne ("The Theory of Everything") and Alicia Vikander ("Ex Machina") play a bohemian married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, apparently happily married and trying for a child in 1920's Copenhagen. Einar is a renowned landscape artist with his wife a struggling portrait artist living in his shadow. After taking part in a cross-dressing modelling session, strong feelings are awakened in Einar. As a bit of a 'game' Gerda encourages him to explore the character of his alter-ego "Lili" further: a big mistake, as Einar is swept into a spiral of confusion and self-doubt.\n\nEddie Redmayne is surely up for another Oscar-nomination for his brave performance as Einar/Lili, using his expressive eyes to great effect and delivering a truly heart-rending performance. With all this said however, I never quite believed I was watching the character of Lili but more Redmayne acting the character. Perhaps this is unfair, as Einar/Lili is such a bizarrely multi-dimensional person no one could perhaps have played him/her to my satisfaction. But I suspect (particularly as Redmayne won last year) this won't bring Redmayne the Oscar double. \n\nFar more impressive for me was the delicious and delightful Alicia Vikander, once more turning in a fantastic performance as the increasingly desperate (both psychologically and sexually) Gerda. With Rooney Mara, Vikander must be one of the brightest actress talents in today's cinema. \n\nAlso turning in a strong performance, in what is a very limited cast list, is Matthias Schoenaerts ("Far from the Madding Crowd") as a Parisian art dealer with a link to Einar's past. The omni-present (sorry, that should read "hard-working") Ben Whishaw turns up again as a party guest with an unhealthy interest in Lili and Sebastian Koch (most recently seen in series 5 of "Homeland") plays Dr Warnekros who is a pioneer in the new and risky business of sexual reassignment surgery.\n\nAnother star of the film is the luscious Danish capital, filmed in vibrant colours, as if from the artists' palettes, by Danny Cohen, a Hooper favourite. Also a big surprise to me was the gloriously photographed Danish countryside, seen at the end of the film, with mountains and seascapes I never knew existed.\n\nAnother Hooper alumni, Alexandre Desplat, supplies the soupy but very fitting score.\n\nWhile the film features a compelling story and much impressive acting, I never personally felt as connected to the story as I was to "The King's Speech". This isn't helped by a rather stagy script by Lucinda Coxon that feels lightweight at times. Perhaps its because we are in Oscar- season but, to me, it all felt a tad pretentious and (no pun intended) could have done with a few snips in places to reduce the running time by 15 minutes or so. That being said, and as an alternative view, I should point out that my wife was in tears for a good proportion of the film and disagrees vehemently with my views. I say "my wife", but since watching the film she's started wearing braces and smoking cigars – so I'm rather confused as to WHAT exactly is going on. :-)\n\n(For the graphical version of this review, see bob-the-movie-man.com.

A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!---------------------------------\n\n************May Contain a Couple MINOR Spoilers************** The TV promo trailer for "The Weather Man" did nothing to capture my interest. It looked like another of those "Light" comedies, which usually just aren't that good. Via recommendations from a few of my students, I decided to check it out. Wow!..Sometimes Hollywood marketing teams are so utterly clueless! In this case, the trailer shown on TV and the film projected in the theater had absolutely nothing in common with one another!\n\nDirector Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Ring) has given us a film that at first glance seems simple enough, but which ends up being as absolutely unpredictable as the science of meteorology itself. David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced meteorologist who has attained considerable success on a professional level, but whose personal life, despite his perpetual fantasies to the contrary, is an explosive and unmitigated disaster.\n\nAs the perturbed and ever-reflexive protagonist, Nicolas Cage (National Treasure, Lord of War) positions himself in the eye of his own tormented life, and is likewise the title character of the film. Like almost every other human being, Spritz is unable to come to grips with the stark reality that the dark clouds constantly present in his life are creations of his own device. They are clearly the consequence of his own actions and his particularly obstinate way of being and not merely products of some uncontrollable, mystical fate.\n\nWhile growing up, young David always loomed in the shadow of his famous Pulitzer-Prize winning father, Robert Spritz, played masterfully by Michael Caine.

A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!---------------------------------\n\n************May Contain a Couple MINOR Spoilers************** The TV promo trailer for "The Weather Man" did nothing to capture my interest. It looked like another of those "Light" comedies, which usually just aren't that good. Via recommendations from a few of my students, I decided to check it out. Wow!..Sometimes Hollywood marketing teams are so utterly clueless! In this case, the trailer shown on TV and the film projected in the theater had absolutely nothing in common with one another!\n\nDirector Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Ring) has given us a film that at first glance seems simple enough, but which ends up being as absolutely unpredictable as the science of meteorology itself. David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced meteorologist who has attained considerable success on a professional level, but whose personal life, despite his perpetual fantasies to the contrary, is an explosive and unmitigated disaster.\n\nAs the perturbed and ever-reflexive protagonist, Nicolas Cage (National Treasure, Lord of War) positions himself in the eye of his own tormented life, and is likewise the title character of the film. Like almost every other human being, Spritz is unable to come to grips with the stark reality that the dark clouds constantly present in his life are creations of his own device. They are clearly the consequence of his own actions and his particularly obstinate way of being and not merely products of some uncontrollable, mystical fate.\n\nWhile growing up, young David always loomed in the shadow of his famous Pulitzer-Prize winning father, Robert Spritz, played masterfully by Michael Caine. It seems that communication between father and son was never really what it should have been. Similarly, David leaves a lot to be desired in the area of warm and communicative interaction with all the important people in his life: His son, daughter, and of course, his ex- wife. David's disconnect is that he fantasizes that love and affection from his loved ones is linked directly to his level of professional success and recognition.\n\nThe Weather Man, despite being a great European style film, suffers from some excesses.

After the superb images in Gravity or Interstellar, I was curious to see what 2019 brings. I wasn't disappointed, the movie is very well shot, the Space images are well made, deep sky, the Planets, the Moon, really nice.\n\nHowever, I think the movie was ruined by its screenplay which lacks of coherence. The story is really weak and undeveloped. There are many fractures in the reality of space travelling,\n\nYou almost have the feeling that the screenplay was written to have a support for the images, nothing more.\n\nSo yeah, I give this movie a 6 and I'm sad to see how a possible epic movie is ruined by a weak screenplay.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":217345,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-09-20","keywords":"astronaut,outer space,father son relationship,moon,missing father","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ad Astra","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3836788505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1550948/","name":"Ruth Negga"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0452101/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0719257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1342473/","name":"Ethan Gross"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Wow!..Sometimes Hollywood marketing teams are so utterly clueless! In this case, the trailer shown on TV and the film projected in the theater had absolutely nothing in common with one another!\n\nDirector Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Ring) has given us a film that at first glance seems simple enough, but which ends up being as absolutely unpredictable as the science of meteorology itself.

They are clearly the consequence of his own actions and his particularly obstinate way of being and not merely products of some uncontrollable, mystical fate.\n\nWhile growing up, young David always loomed in the shadow of his famous Pulitzer-Prize winning father, Robert Spritz, played masterfully by Michael Caine. It seems that communication between father and son was never really what it should have been. Similarly, David leaves a lot to be desired in the area of warm and communicative interaction with all the important people in his life: His son, daughter, and of course, his ex- wife. David's disconnect is that he fantasizes that love and affection from his loved ones is linked directly to his level of professional success and recognition.\n\nThe Weather Man, despite being a great European style film, suffers from some excesses.

Nakon što se čovječanstvo samo dovelo na rub izumiranja, jedan gorljivi preživjeli usamljenik probija se kanadskim bespućem u potrazi za znanjem i sredstvima s ciljem preoblikovanja čovječanstva. Deset godina poslije žena podiže desetero djece iste dobi te ih priprema na žrtve koje će morati podnijeti kako bi spasili ljudsku vrstu.</desc>

And I was kind of hoping he'd meet that kid somehow and give him the 20,000 bahts (it is a Roger Moore Bond movie, after all, so it's not like it would have been an unbelievable coincidence).\n\nOverall, it wasn't wonderful but not that bad either.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":101467,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1974-12-20","keywords":"secret agent,official james bond series,assassin,mission,female martial artist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2754854681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FkOGI3NTMtMWQ3Ny00ZjIyLWE1NzYtZDYyZjE2NDc3MDQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FkOGI3NTMtMWQ3Ny00ZjIyLWE1NzYtZDYyZjE2NDc3MDQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000549/","name":"Roger Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000489/","name":"Christopher Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001180/","name":"Britt Ekland"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542539/","name":"Tom Mankiewicz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Even though there are the odd (bordering on) romantic interludes the story line remains true to the theme of the title and they do not over-shadow the stories.\n\nSecond, I quite like viewing shows that depict times gone by and it is interesting to see how detectives'/police duties were (supposedly) undertaken in that time.\n\nThird, the acting and story telling - as noted in a previous post - equals that of Midsummer Murders, Poirot (another favourite of mine), Judge John Deed (again, another favourite).\n\nI like each character who has a distinct role and adds to the show as well as the enjoyment of watching the show.

Murchoch Mysteries is one of 4 particular shows that I watch regularly - and tape so that I do not miss them.\n\nThere are three main reasons that I like MM.\n\nFirst, it is such a pleasure to watch something that does not have swearing, sex scenes, and gratuitous violence. Even though there are the odd (bordering on) romantic interludes the story line remains true to the theme of the title and they do not over-shadow the stories.\n\nSecond, I quite like viewing shows that depict times gone by and it is interesting to see how detectives'/police duties were (supposedly) undertaken in that time.\n\nThird, the acting and story telling - as noted in a previous post - equals that of Midsummer Murders, Poirot (another favourite of mine), Judge John Deed (again, another favourite).\n\nI like each character who has a distinct role and adds to the show as well as the enjoyment of watching the show. I do hope that there are quite a few new series planned.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12369,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I have a vague knowledge of the Soviet invasions in the 1940s but that is about it so this cold war thriller is new territory.\n\nA slow burn series that drew me in bit by bit and with quite a number of unexpected twists.\n\nWho are the real heroes in this? That is perhaps the most difficult question of all.\n\nBut atmospheric design and music, quality acting, a script that seamlessly moves between Finnish, Russian, English and Swedish is a fine mix.\n\nRecommended for lovers of cold war spy thrillers.

No stunning secrets are revealed for the fans of Morse. There are the little clues for the over-involved, but to be honest it's best enjoyed for its own sake. The most interesting character in it is Fred Thursday, and his fatherly care for young Morse is quite touching. The last episode of season 1, "Home" illustrates this quite nicely. Roger Allam steals the show every time!

No stunning secrets are revealed for the fans of Morse. There are the little clues for the over-involved, but to be honest it's best enjoyed for its own sake. The most interesting character in it is Fred Thursday, and his fatherly care for young Morse is quite touching. The last episode of season 1, "Home" illustrates this quite nicely. Roger Allam steals the show every time! Otherwise it's pleasant to see that television is beginning to feel some nostalgia for the sixties, which are more realistically represented here than in "Heartbeat".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22385,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The premise about Dr. Lucien Blake, a police surgeon (kind of like an earlier era law enforcement medical examiner) who can't escape the shadow of his super successful father, also a doctor is intriguing. Blake (portrayed with a steady hand by Craig McLachlan) makes a few totally human assumptions along the way in each weeks mystery. This means he messes up and sometimes is lead down the wrong path before finding the right one. I like this because it means there aren't too many ridiculous jumps in logic when the sleuthing happens and the clues are followed. Sometimes the mysteries can be solved by the audience before the end but sometimes not. Again, I like something that makes me think a bit. Its also nice to watch a show from Australia that doesn't feature the tired stories about bubble heads hanging out on a beach or some forgettable vapid slapstick comedy thing. Great show, solid cast, nice tidy little, well-written under-an-hour whodunits. Grab a cup of tea or Java and have a sit-down and watch this show if you like mysteries.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4093,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2013-02-01","keywords":"doctor","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307739/","name":"Nadine Garner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572112/","name":"Craig McLachlan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0184083/","name":"Charlie Cousins"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0392993/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0010984/","name":"George Adams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131770/","name":"Tony Wright"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3801727257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc4MmFiZGUtZDllYy00ZjRkLWE5NDEtNTE2YTkzMGIwYjI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc4MmFiZGUtZDllYy00ZjRkLWE5NDEtNTE2YTkzMGIwYjI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The premise about Dr. Lucien Blake, a police surgeon (kind of like an earlier era law enforcement medical examiner) who can't escape the shadow of his super successful father, also a doctor is intriguing. Blake (portrayed with a steady hand by Craig McLachlan) makes a few totally human assumptions along the way in each weeks mystery. This means he messes up and sometimes is lead down the wrong path before finding the right one. I like this because it means there aren't too many ridiculous jumps in logic when the sleuthing happens and the clues are followed. Sometimes the mysteries can be solved by the audience before the end but sometimes not. Again, I like something that makes me think a bit. Its also nice to watch a show from Australia that doesn't feature the tired stories about bubble heads hanging out on a beach or some forgettable vapid slapstick comedy thing. Great show, solid cast, nice tidy little, well-written under-an-hour whodunits. Grab a cup of tea or Java and have a sit-down and watch this show if you like mysteries.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4093,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2013-02-01","keywords":"doctor","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307739/","name":"Nadine Garner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572112/","name":"Craig McLachlan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0184083/","name":"Charlie Cousins"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0392993/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0010984/","name":"George Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131770/","name":"Tony Wright"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3801727257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc4MmFiZGUtZDllYy00ZjRkLWE5NDEtNTE2YTkzMGIwYjI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc4MmFiZGUtZDllYy00ZjRkLWE5NDEtNTE2YTkzMGIwYjI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti.

Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

It is already here. FBI Special Agent Shea Salazar leads the cybercrime unit. She visits her hospitalized friend Richard Weiss who found a hidden computer code. Apparently, someone or something is attacking him with tech. He had left her a tape addressed to LeBlanc with a somewhat paranoid warning. Paul had been kicked out of his own company after shelving his AI program which his brother Ted as the new CEO has reactivated.\n\nThis show got the quick axe after two episodes. It probably deserves better but it never gained a good audience. It does have Slattery leading a good cast in a fun thriller. It runs into the foreseeable problem of an omnipotent enemy opposed by a ragtag team. It's an uneven fight unless the AI is brought down a few notches or some contrivances be introduced. This does both with varying degrees of success. My initial thought is that the show should explain why the AI doesn't simply multiple. It's an easy solution. The AI doesn't want competition and therefore it doesn't want other AIs. My other thought is that the ragtag group needs better camouflage. They should be found much more easily by all the security cameras. Either give them some fictional tech or have the AI hack the camera system later in the show.

It is already here. FBI Special Agent Shea Salazar leads the cybercrime unit. She visits her hospitalized friend Richard Weiss who found a hidden computer code. Apparently, someone or something is attacking him with tech. He had left her a tape addressed to LeBlanc with a somewhat paranoid warning. Paul had been kicked out of his own company after shelving his AI program which his brother Ted as the new CEO has reactivated.\n\nThis show got the quick axe after two episodes. It probably deserves better but it never gained a good audience. It does have Slattery leading a good cast in a fun thriller. It runs into the foreseeable problem of an omnipotent enemy opposed by a ragtag team. It's an uneven fight unless the AI is brought down a few notches or some contrivances be introduced. This does both with varying degrees of success. My initial thought is that the show should explain why the AI doesn't simply multiple. It's an easy solution. The AI doesn't want competition and therefore it doesn't want other AIs. My other thought is that the ragtag group needs better camouflage. They should be found much more easily by all the security cameras. Either give them some fictional tech or have the AI hack the camera system later in the show. There needs to be a clearer progression of the AI's abilities. The show gets a rushed conclusion. The characters do a bit too much handwringing about their tactics especially in the last few episodes. There is one character who is forced to do unlikely tasks for the sake of drama.

    <desc lang="hr">Nakon Charliejeve smrti, milijarder Walden useljava se u kuću na plaži s Alanom i Jakeom. Depresivan, Walden se oslanja na Alana koji će ga trenirati. "Dva i pol muškarca" prikazuje život dvojice braće, sina/nećaka i mnoštva žena koje ih okružuju. Točnije, Charlie Harper dobrostojeći je neženja s kućom na obali, Mercedesom u garaži i znanjem vještog ophođenja sa ženama. Ali njegov opušteni život u Malibuu ometaju njegov ukočeni i napeti brat Alan i Alanov sin Jake, koji već godinama žive kod njega. Unatoč kompleksnosti njihovih života i njihovim međusobnim napetim odnosima, Charlie i Alan jedno imaju zajedničko: obojica vole Jakea i žele mu samo najbolje. Zato uspijevaju stvoriti malu obiteljsku zajednicu u kojoj bi svatko od njih mogao postati bolji čovjek.</desc>

"The Whole Nine Yards" is a great movie to simply sit back and enjoy.\n\nNicholas "Oz" Ozeransky (Matthew Perry) is a mild-mannered dentist whose stuck with a wife who hates him (Rosanna Arquette in a hilariously over-the-top performance) and a huge debt that his partner (his father-in-law) left him when he kicked the bucket. Then his new neighbor moves in. This neighbor, much to Oz's horror, is none other than Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), the infamous hit-man for the Gogolak gang. Oz's wife tells him that they should rat Jimmy out to the Gogolaks to get a "finder's fee." Oz obviously refuses, but agrees to go when his wife agrees that if he does this, she'll give him a divorce. Thus begins a hilarious story of double crosses, new romances, and hamburgers with mayonnaise.\n\nThe cast is first rate. Matthew Perry is in full panic-mode, and his reactions to the situations he finds himself in (and their resulting consequences) are hilarious. Bruce Willis is perfectly cast as Jimmy. It's a typecast role, but Willis plays him with a slight tongue-in-cheek. It works wonderfully. While it allows for plenty of laughs, it also gives him an air of menace, which adds another layer to the humor. We are aware of Jimmy's capacity for violence, but the way Willis plays it results in moments of laughter mixed with suspense. Natasha Henstridge radiates a cool sexuality mixed with vulnerability as Jimmy's ex-wife who falls for Oz. Michael Clarke Duncan is also well-cast as Jimmy's fellow hit-man, Frankie. Kevin Pollack and Rosanna Arquette are so over-the-top that their performances must be seen to be believed.\n\nBut as good as this cast is, and it's great, the film is stolen from all of them by newcomer Amanda Peet. It takes a great performer to steal scenes with actors at the top of their game. But Peet didn't just steal her scenes, she walked away with the whole movie. Peet is positively delightful as Oz's ditzy receptionist, who has more of a part to play in this than anyone realizes. Peet is hysterical; her performance should have at least gotten her an Oscar nod, if not a win.\n\n"The Whole Nine Yards" is a mix of film-noir and screwball comedy. Director Jonathan Lynn has a lot of fun with the conventions of each genre, including mixing and matching the character traits of the femme-fatale and the "good girl" (you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie). What I really liked is that the humor of the movie is not over-the-top exaggeration humor (like The Farrelly Brothers). This is more about timing and dialogue; it's like a 1930's screwball comedy without the Hays Code. To be sure, the film does not leave out the trademark of the noir genre: the twisty plot. "The Whole Nine Yards" boasts plenty of surprises, and quite a bit of suspense. Just because this is a comedy doesn't mean you can tell where it's going.\n\nMixing these two genres would seem impossible because more often than not, one would dilute the other. But Lynn manages to walk the line between the two opposite genres and play them both equally well. The film is well-paced, and the timing on the jokes is perfect. There are no over-the-top visual effects, and that's a good thing.\n\n"The Whole Nine Yards" may not be classic film material, but it's highly entertaining. And with a movie like this, that's just about all that one could ask for.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":117170,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-02-18","keywords":"hitman,adultery,marriage problems,nudity,bare breasts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4278959641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001612/","name":"Matthew Perry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000275/","name":"Rosanna Arquette"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0528718/","name":"Jonathan Lynn"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043393/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026797/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0140758/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0438449/","name":"Mitchell Kapner"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And with a movie like this, that's just about all that one could ask for.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":117170,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2000-02-18","keywords":"hitman,adultery,marriage problems,nudity,bare breasts","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4278959641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001612/","name":"Matthew Perry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000275/","name":"Rosanna Arquette"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0528718/","name":"Jonathan Lynn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043393/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026797/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0140758/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0438449/","name":"Mitchell Kapner"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Vices make us complete human beings.  We can surpress them and deny them, but we can't quite run away from them.  Does it not strike you as a little humorous when someone looks at a menu, knows exactly what they want, but then decides not to get it for fear they will not only offend their God, but offend their own nature?  Lasse Hollstrom's latest film, Chocolat, knows all about that person.\n\nJuliette Binoche stars as Vianne Rosher, a chocolate shop owner who not only gets people to talk about their forbidden fruits, but also has the ability to make people happily indulge in them.  She, along with her daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), moves into a quiet French village during Lent and opens her chocolate shop. The townspeople look in the window, admire the confections for a moment, then walk on by.\n\n One diabetic woman, Amande (Judi Dench), decides to stay for a little while.  Vianne puts a colorful ceramic plate on the table and spins it around.  She asks what Amande sees in the image. Amande tells her and Vianne presumes to know exactly what kind of confection Amande would like the best. We could only dream of such customer service this time of year.\n\nAmande's young grandson, Luc, an aspiring artist, also can't seem to stay away from the chocolate store, in spite of the wishes of his churchgoing mother (Carrie-Anne Moss).  Actually, the whole town goes to the same church and it doesn't take long before the Mayor (Alfred Molena) has his say against the shop, since many of the chocolates have been carved into the shapes of naked women and have names such as Nipples of Venus.  The chocolates also seem to be changing people's behavior.  A sexless, joyless married couple all of a sudden can't keep their Butterfingers off each other.\n\nThe non-churchgoing Vianne eventually becomes the center of the town's controversy, but she soon has company after the arrival of the river rats, a group of Irish merchants who travel by boat to pawn off whatever they can, much to the dismay of the townspeople.  Here, Vianne meets Roux (Johnny Depp), and they become fast friends and, well, you know the rest.\n\nThe story of Chocolat could be described in one sentence-Footloose, only instead of dancing, it's chocolates.  However, in this film we have some magic realism to deal with.  Unfortunately, the film does not quite develop its own `magical' ideas.  It gets bogged down by the usual story elements an d sub-plots we often see with this kind of story.  We get the battered wife who finds solace in Vianne's shop and we get the burning of a particular place (here, a boat) to further drive home the point that outsiders will not be tolerated.  I would have liked a little more `magic.'\n\nOn the other hand, we do get some magic in the form of the performances. Juliette Binoche actually smiles and acts charming, as opposed to the sorrowful and pensive roles in which we usually see her.  What a relief to finally see her carrying a picture with warmth, confidence and wit, as well as beauty.  The guitar-twanging Johnny Depp (reuniting with his Gilbert Grape director), with a ponytail and an Irish accent, compliments her with a rugged look and easygoing charm that makes his fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants character a perfect soulmate for Binoche.\n\nI recommend stopping by the candy counter or sneaking in some Fannie May confections before the movie starts.  This film does for chocolate what Big Night did for Italian food. In spite of its flaws, Chocolat makes for a far more rewarding and satisfying film experience than Hollstrom's last feel-gooder, the over-rated Cider House Rules.  In the end, something about this film won me over.  It could have been the irrisistable theme of great food being as close to Godliness as one could get.  It could have been the sights of chocolates being created and turned into glorious, statuesque works of art.  It could have been the enjoyable cast, each member dealing with their hidden anguish and repression.  Or it could have been all of the above, combined with the captivating and alluring grace of Juliette Binoche.\n\nWe all have our vices."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":185021,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-24","keywords":"chocolate,france,village,food,magical realism","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Chocolat","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2733547033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRjNGI4MmYtY2U1ZS00N2UzLTk5MzgtMjIxYjlhMDI2NWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRjNGI4MmYtY2U1ZS00N2UzLTk5MzgtMjIxYjlhMDI2NWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000547/","name":"Alfred Molina"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002120/","name":"Lasse Hallström"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031919/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104130/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0364862/","name":"Joanne Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414608/","name":"Robert Nelson Jacobs"}],"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is basically a legal drama about a group of top graduates from the nations best law schools (half US attorneys/ half federal public defenders), battling each other in the highly influential Southern District of NY. Because the series is set in Federal Court- legal issues tend to be constitutional in nature... so the legal issues are a bit more academic than many other legal dramas.

It is basically a legal drama about a group of top graduates from the nations best law schools (half US attorneys/ half federal public defenders), battling each other in the highly influential Southern District of NY. Because the series is set in Federal Court- legal issues tend to be constitutional in nature... so the legal issues are a bit more academic than many other legal dramas. I think the characters have an array of personalities &amp; the legal issues hold your attention &amp; the show overall has a good pace. I definitely recommend checking it out.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5265,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-03-13","keywords":"work","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204706/","name":"Hope Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0791570/","name":"Ben Shenkman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5506401/","name":"Jasmin Savoy Brown"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0690533/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6045762/","name":"Paul William Davies"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For the People","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1317124377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFjZDBhZDctZmE3ZS00ZmI1LWIwZmQtYmQxZTEyZDEzNjI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk2ODc0MjY@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFjZDBhZDctZmE3ZS00ZmI1LWIwZmQtYmQxZTEyZDEzNjI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk2ODc0MjY@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A Vegas entertainer once, he got to know the local mob and was taken by the lifestyle to the point that he began his own crew. Unfortunately for him and everyone he knows, it has caught up with him and he now finds himself targeted by all sides and in the hands of the FBI, desperately trying to make a deal with them from the security of the penthouse floor of a luxury hotel. However the FBI pick up wind of a hit called in by Sparazza with a strict time limit, a $1,000,000 bounty and cut out Buddy's heart. It is not long before a handful of bounty hunters are heading towards the hotel with one aim  to be the first.\n\nOn a transatlantic flight during the day I had time for one more film before landing. As I was just trying to relax I was looking for undemanding stuff just to distract and entertain me. The film I watched first was Shooter and I mention this deliberately. Shooter was only an OK film but what it did was lay out its stall and make it very clear what it was going to do and how it was going to do it  not necessarily in terms of plotting but more in terms of style and approach. It wasn't great but it worked. I assumed that Smokin' Aces would do the same as the trailer made it look like a comic hit-man film  with hyper filming, lots of stars and lots of action.\n\nNow, if you're thinking that I shouldn't assume then you're right, but this is how the film starts and it is how it is at various stages across the film. However it goes from being a bit like Guy Richie (freeze frames, names on screen etc) to being an all out action fest, with guns everywhere and people surviving the way that they only do in action films. The suddenly in the final third it decides that it not going to be superficially comic or superficially action-packed and suddenly seemed to have an emotional side and expected me to care about the characters and their plights  like it had been a serious drama all along (although I'm not sure how I'm supposed to take the ADD kid with the erection in that context).\n\nIn doing this it does still do just about enough to keep a story going but to be honest I started to get bored as it changed tone based on whatever it want to do. Another problem I had with it was the violence  it was very brutal throughout, which I don't have a problem with but the mixed tone meant it was confused. With the comic feel the violent death of characters is really jarring, likewise with the action section  it just seemed too much and made it hard to enjoy. The final turn of tone actually makes the violence work because the extent of it works when you actually are expected to feel it  however by then it was too little too late.\n\nKeeping this in mind it is no surprise that nobody is really that good. Piven goes from ham to tragic figure; it is a nice try but the film doesn't go with him and he is left exposed. Reynolds is reasonably good on the level he works on, a good presence  I've never seen him in anything that good but I generally like him when I see him. Affleck, Berg, Garcia, Liotta and a few others are solid enough but not anything special. Keys is good-looking but she is helped by Henson who is sassy and cute at the same time. The real stand out for me was Common. He dropped out of a big tour to make this and I felt bad that he seemed to be going down the "rapper goes to Hollywood to be in action movie" path. However he is actually one of the few who impressed me; not throughout the film perhaps but in the one scene he has with Piven in the bathroom I did think that he showed potential to do more than just be in this sort of thing. Time will tell if he can move away form just being a good looking guy with a deep voice, but he did seem in touch with his character here.\n\nOverall though, the film is nothing to write home about. With an inconsistent approach that sees approach markedly changed abruptly not once but twice, the film is hard to stick with. It probably offers enough noise and narrative to please those looking for noise and violence but personally I was disappointed and found it hard to care that much about."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142150,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2007-03-14","keywords":"mafia,casino,mob hit,sniper,apostrophe in title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17612313","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ5ZmFlYTEtNzVjMy00ZGY1LTk5YTctODJjYTA2OTI2MGI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ5ZmFlYTEtNzVjMy00ZGY1LTk5YTctODJjYTA2OTI2MGI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005315/","name":"Jeremy Piven"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000501/","name":"Ray Liotta"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0138620/","name":"Joe Carnahan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0138620/","name":"Joe Carnahan"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A Vegas entertainer once, he got to know the local mob and was taken by the lifestyle to the point that he began his own crew. Unfortunately for him and everyone he knows, it has caught up with him and he now finds himself targeted by all sides and in the hands of the FBI, desperately trying to make a deal with them from the security of the penthouse floor of a luxury hotel. However the FBI pick up wind of a hit called in by Sparazza with a strict time limit, a $1,000,000 bounty and cut out Buddy's heart. It is not long before a handful of bounty hunters are heading towards the hotel with one aim  to be the first.\n\nOn a transatlantic flight during the day I had time for one more film before landing. As I was just trying to relax I was looking for undemanding stuff just to distract and entertain me. The film I watched first was Shooter and I mention this deliberately. Shooter was only an OK film but what it did was lay out its stall and make it very clear what it was going to do and how it was going to do it  not necessarily in terms of plotting but more in terms of style and approach. It wasn't great but it worked. I assumed that Smokin' Aces would do the same as the trailer made it look like a comic hit-man film  with hyper filming, lots of stars and lots of action.\n\nNow, if you're thinking that I shouldn't assume then you're right, but this is how the film starts and it is how it is at various stages across the film. However it goes from being a bit like Guy Richie (freeze frames, names on screen etc) to being an all out action fest, with guns everywhere and people surviving the way that they only do in action films. The suddenly in the final third it decides that it not going to be superficially comic or superficially action-packed and suddenly seemed to have an emotional side and expected me to care about the characters and their plights  like it had been a serious drama all along (although I'm not sure how I'm supposed to take the ADD kid with the erection in that context).\n\nIn doing this it does still do just about enough to keep a story going but to be honest I started to get bored as it changed tone based on whatever it want to do.

Blade Runner (either version) stands the test of time as an epic story which transcends a disparity of genres, as well as the seminal "dark" sci-fi film which has been mimicked so frequently (to varying degrees of success) since its original release. The interplay of film noir, sci-fi, and what is one of the most philosophically symbolic and academically analyzed narratives of the modern era holds its ground on both visual and cerebral levels even in the face of today's CGI laden blockbusters. The new director's cut, contrary to many cinematic re-hashings, actually serves to clarify many of the more nebulous aspects of the plot and makes a great film even better, arguably allowing it to be modernized and polished for a new generation of viewers who are more picky and yet simultaneously less idealistic. All while sustaining the feeling and flavor of the original. Call it restorative work if you will. The tinny and meandering score by Vangelis is pure 1980s at its most brooding and fits the texture and mood of the film beautifully.

Blade Runner (either version) stands the test of time as an epic story which transcends a disparity of genres, as well as the seminal "dark" sci-fi film which has been mimicked so frequently (to varying degrees of success) since its original release. The interplay of film noir, sci-fi, and what is one of the most philosophically symbolic and academically analyzed narratives of the modern era holds its ground on both visual and cerebral levels even in the face of today's CGI laden blockbusters. The new director's cut, contrary to many cinematic re-hashings, actually serves to clarify many of the more nebulous aspects of the plot and makes a great film even better, arguably allowing it to be modernized and polished for a new generation of viewers who are more picky and yet simultaneously less idealistic. All while sustaining the feeling and flavor of the original. Call it restorative work if you will. The tinny and meandering score by Vangelis is pure 1980s at its most brooding and fits the texture and mood of the film beautifully. Indeed, for many reasons, finding this film in someone's DVD collection makes a true statement about their discriminating and refined taste in movies, and equally their appreciation of film as an artistic medium.

Now, I rented the DVD. I can't say I got as many laughs as the first time, though, and I started to notice more flaws.  At first I thought this movie was better than the original.  Now I'm not sure.  They both have great redeeming qualities that pretty much balance the scale.\n\nThe two films movie at a similar rhythm.  In the original, we opened with Jim's Dad walking in on him while masturbating.  In the sequel, he walks in on him while he's having sex, only it's taken to the next level with the girlfriend's parents walking in as well.  And we have the keg party, with a Steadicam shot following Stiffler around, who yet again gets into a mishap with bodily fluids.  And of course, in homage of the famous Nadia scene from the original, we have the guys walking in on two lesbians.\n\n The laughs are still there, and there are some genuinely funny moments.  I don't want to give them away, though the previews and some of the other reviewers probably already did.\n\nThe cast still got it.  Eugene Levy steals the show yet again as Jim's Dad. I do have to say, Stiffler's character got a little too obnoxious at times. It's often funny to hear his foul-mouthed insults, but by the hundredth time you hear him use the word "f**kface" it gets kinda old.\n\n I'm always going to hold the "American Pie" movies several notches above the standard gross-out teen comedies, because they have zest and originality. Not to mention they're done in a professional manner.  The gags are as intelligent as they are crude, and delivered with exquisite timing.  And to top it off, it's a heartfelt film that is not literally all about getting laid.  I thought the original had more heart to it, but the sequel also has its heart in the right place.\n\nThe music is great.  The soundtrack is full of really cool songs, including "Smooth Criminal" by Alien Ant Farm.  And be sure to check out the unrated DVD special edition.  The commentary is cool and--unlike with the first "American Pie" unrated edition--there is some bonus footage worth checking out.  The lesbian scene is extended significantly.  In the theatrical version, there was only a brief nudity, but you get to see much more in this version.\n\nI'm still not sure if I would consider this movie better than the first, but it is one sequel that lives up to the original--and that's saying a lot!\n\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":248085,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2001-08-10","keywords":"coitus,female nudity,college student,reference to safe sex,female removes her clothes","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"American Pie 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4043966233","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJlNzYzY2YtOWM5MS00M2U1LWE4OTItZTQwYjVkNDY0MWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJlNzYzY2YtOWM5MS00M2U1LWE4OTItZTQwYjVkNDY0MWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Teaser trailer for this comedy follow up"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004755/","name":"Jason Biggs"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005405/","name":"Seann William Scott"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002436/","name":"Shannon Elizabeth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736930/","name":"J.B.

Now, I rented the DVD. I can't say I got as many laughs as the first time, though, and I started to notice more flaws.  At first I thought this movie was better than the original.  Now I'm not sure.  They both have great redeeming qualities that pretty much balance the scale.\n\nThe two films movie at a similar rhythm.  In the original, we opened with Jim's Dad walking in on him while masturbating.  In the sequel, he walks in on him while he's having sex, only it's taken to the next level with the girlfriend's parents walking in as well.  And we have the keg party, with a Steadicam shot following Stiffler around, who yet again gets into a mishap with bodily fluids.  And of course, in homage of the famous Nadia scene from the original, we have the guys walking in on two lesbians.\n\n The laughs are still there, and there are some genuinely funny moments.  I don't want to give them away, though the previews and some of the other reviewers probably already did.\n\nThe cast still got it.  Eugene Levy steals the show yet again as Jim's Dad. I do have to say, Stiffler's character got a little too obnoxious at times. It's often funny to hear his foul-mouthed insults, but by the hundredth time you hear him use the word "f**kface" it gets kinda old.\n\n I'm always going to hold the "American Pie" movies several notches above the standard gross-out teen comedies, because they have zest and originality. Not to mention they're done in a professional manner.  The gags are as intelligent as they are crude, and delivered with exquisite timing.  And to top it off, it's a heartfelt film that is not literally all about getting laid.  I thought the original had more heart to it, but the sequel also has its heart in the right place.\n\nThe music is great.  The soundtrack is full of really cool songs, including "Smooth Criminal" by Alien Ant Farm.  And be sure to check out the unrated DVD special edition.  The commentary is cool and--unlike with the first "American Pie" unrated edition--there is some bonus footage worth checking out.  The lesbian scene is extended significantly.  In the theatrical version, there was only a brief nudity, but you get to see much more in this version.\n\nI'm still not sure if I would consider this movie better than the first, but it is one sequel that lives up to the original--and that's saying a lot!\n\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":248085,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2001-08-10","keywords":"coitus,female nudity,college student,reference to safe sex,female removes her clothes","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"American Pie 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4043966233","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJlNzYzY2YtOWM5MS00M2U1LWE4OTItZTQwYjVkNDY0MWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJlNzYzY2YtOWM5MS00M2U1LWE4OTItZTQwYjVkNDY0MWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Teaser trailer for this comedy follow up","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004755/","name":"Jason Biggs","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005405/","name":"Seann William Scott","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002436/","name":"Shannon Elizabeth"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736930/","name":"J.B.

To me, this was an espionage-thriller so the added bonus of some comedy made the movie move right along at a good pace. \n\nIt was engaging for me, I enjoyed it, but the entire time I couldn't help but wonder why Disney/Pixar chose to tell this story through a kids movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":173686,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-06-24","keywords":"car race,car,best friend,spy,conspiracy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Â“Tokyo PartyÂ”","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1822465049","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MjE0MDk4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk3OTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MjE0MDk4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk3OTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A clip from Cars 2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1249256/","name":"Larry the Cable Guy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000323/","name":"Michael Caine"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506977/","name":"Bradford Lewis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506977/","name":"Bradford Lewis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1557594/","name":"Dan Fogelman"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The build up and anticipation for it was great. I had high expectations. With Clive Owen and Nicole Kidman leading the charge, it was Kaufman's to screw up, and screw it up he did.\n\nThe characters were shallow, but they fit right in with the ankle deep script. I thought the historic film gimmick was overplayed and laughable at times. Clive Owen tried his hardest to bring life to Stahl and Turner's straw-man. Hemingway never had any real motive and when it appeared that he might, it was abandoned. Nicole Kidman did a fine job as well, but it had to be long days and frustrating nights with the stiff dialogue. The supporting cast was lifeless, filled with assumptions, and caricatures of an era.

The build up and anticipation for it was great. I had high expectations. With Clive Owen and Nicole Kidman leading the charge, it was Kaufman's to screw up, and screw it up he did.\n\nThe characters were shallow, but they fit right in with the ankle deep script. I thought the historic film gimmick was overplayed and laughable at times. Clive Owen tried his hardest to bring life to Stahl and Turner's straw-man. Hemingway never had any real motive and when it appeared that he might, it was abandoned. Nicole Kidman did a fine job as well, but it had to be long days and frustrating nights with the stiff dialogue. The supporting cast was lifeless, filled with assumptions, and caricatures of an era. Watching this film was like watching an artist that promised to paint you a masterpiece then he pulled out a mop.

I would say I had pretty low knowledge in films before I first saw Inside Out (not to say that I'm highly intelligent on films now). I only saw about 200 films prior. I hadn't seen a lot of classic films or even know that film can be an art form just through its camera work among other aspects. So you could say that I can't speak for everyone on my views of this film. And you may be right because opinions are subjective anyway.\n\nThis is my favourite film ever.\n\nLike I said above, I didn't see a lot of films that were deemed as masterpieces at that time. While I still have a lot more to see, I can say that I have caught up with many notable ones now. I've seen The Godfather. I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen Casablanca. I've seen The Shawshank Redemption. I've seen Pulp Fiction. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nYet this is still my favourite film of all-time.\n\n80 years from now, this won't change. I felt something extraordinary that will never be felt again. This to me, was a revelation. In honest words I've never experienced something like this before. Only because of Inside Out I was able to kick myself off of a serious depression I had for years, understand the meaning of feeling, feel sympathy to why people act the way they do, be interested in films. In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.\n\nEver since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).\n\nInside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.\n\nIn the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.\n\nYou can vote "not helpful" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here.... I wonder why...) but it's not going to matter anyway. This is a beautiful film that will resonate in me always.\n\nI will never forget Inside Out.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":660021,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-17","keywords":"joy,sadness,anger,memory,running away","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Theaters: June 19","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi203730969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inside Out is in theaters on June 19!"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688132/","name":"Amy Poehler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352778/","name":"Bill Hader"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085400/","name":"Lewis Black"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498834/","name":"Meg LeFauve"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While I still have a lot more to see, I can say that I have caught up with many notable ones now. I've seen The Godfather. I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen Casablanca. I've seen The Shawshank Redemption. I've seen Pulp Fiction. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nYet this is still my favourite film of all-time.\n\n80 years from now, this won't change. I felt something extraordinary that will never be felt again. This to me, was a revelation. In honest words I've never experienced something like this before. Only because of Inside Out I was able to kick myself off of a serious depression I had for years, understand the meaning of feeling, feel sympathy to why people act the way they do, be interested in films. In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.\n\nEver since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).\n\nInside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.\n\nIn the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.\n\nYou can vote "not helpful" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here.... I wonder why...) but it's not going to matter anyway. This is a beautiful film that will resonate in me always.\n\nI will never forget Inside Out.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":660021,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-17","keywords":"joy,sadness,anger,memory,running away","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Theaters: June 19","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi203730969","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inside Out is in theaters on June 19!","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688132/","name":"Amy Poehler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352778/","name":"Bill Hader","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085400/","name":"Lewis Black"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498834/","name":"Meg LeFauve"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Australia has all of this, but also a little bit of corn, a thin plot, weak characters and flaws that are even more noticeable in a super-production like this.\n\nThe script is uneven and Manichean (with angels and demons) and mixes several movie genres (romantic comedy, romantic drama, war movie, western movie, and Aboriginal movie) with different degrees of success. The characters are descriptive and without emotional depth, and that affects the acting. However, I loved the depiction of the magic and wisdom of Aboriginal Australians, which is really well presented, with its magic beliefs and philosophical and environmental approach to the world. I think that part is truly genuine and real and reaches the viewer. I also loved that Lady Ashley's character is the one of a true modern woman, as she is a strong-willed free woman, a boss, the boss of her man, a woman who always leads, never submissive or afraid of being alone if she doesn't get what she wants. That's a post-modern woman, so rare to see in cinema nowadays.\n\nThe acting is unconvincing on the part of the leading actors. Hugh Jackman's performance is just OK in his role, while Nicole Kidman disappoints in the comic part of the movie, as she seems not to relax when she does so, but she warms up to her usual self when the story becomes more dramatic; she looks beautiful in this movie, like a 50s movie star, although those inflated siliconed lips were a distraction... Jackman and Kidman make a great couple, but their chemistry on camera was nothing memorable and you see yourself seeing two actors playing a couple, not a real couple on screen.\n\nMost supporting actors are good in their roles, especially the Aboriginal ones, who really shine in this film. David Gulpilil is simply terrific, completely believable and inspired in his role of the Aboriginal Elder King George. Brandon Walters, despite his youth, offers a memorable performance, and his face really lights up the screen. Also great is the actor who plays Drove's Aboriginal pal, who also offers a solid performance. They are the ones who really give soul to the movie.\n\nDespite what you might expect, the cinematography is poor. I was expecting the rare beauty of the Northern Territory to be captured by the always stylish and colorful Luhrmann. However, the part of the movie that happens during the dry season is completely opaque and colorless, ugly to watch, while the scenes happening during the rainy season are again limited in colors.To my disenchantment, many of the most colorful and beautiful scenes are digitally created or enhanced, while others seem to have been shot in big studios. Just the Mission island seems to convey that luxurious real feeling of the NT vegetation. Some of the most beautiful bits of the real land, the aerial vistas, look like if they had been taken for a documentary for National Geographic. Where is the emotional connection of the story with the land? In other words, the viewer doesn't go beyond what the eyes see. So, one wonders, why the movie was called Australia and why it was sold as a movie that captured the spirit of this country. To be honest, I thought that most scenes in the movie could have been shot anywhere in the world not in Australia.\n\nThe movie is a little too long. Most of the first half an hour could have been removed , condensed or presented in another way to give the non-Aboriginal characters more emotional background and depth. For example, we barely know why Neil Fletcher wants so badly Sarah's farm, and why he's so wicked in general but he loves a lovable sweet good- hearted woman. He is just an archetypal bad-guy, period.\n\nDespite its flaws, I enjoyed the movie, especially the second hour and a half, and that heaven of a man that is Hugh Jackman. God Bless him and his holy body.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":122133,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When you're down and out, the best shot is, simply, to   Go for it!","reviewBody":"When a doctor or a family member tells you that the only life you have ever know is over, that can be a pretty bitter pill too swallow. In Rocky V, Rocky Balboa is faced with such a scenario. This movie proves to me that you need to have more than one string to your arrow, as you never know when it might come in handy one day. Rocky V also points out that money and possession are not the important things in life, but family and (true) friends are!\n\nLosing it all does not mean a thing unless you've got something to lose  And Rocky Balboa had it all. Times have changed, though, for former Heavyweight champion of the world. A lifetime of fighting has taken its toll, mentally and physically, and the maneuverings of an scrupulous accountant have left him financially strapped. But resiliency and the ability to come back have been trademarks of the Rocky legend. Just when it looks like the champ is down for the count, he discovers the raw talent of a young fighter named Tommy Gunn, who just might be Rocky's last chance for glory. In a world where achievement is marked by dollars and cents, and in a profession where success is measured in wins and losses, Rocky Balboa knows that, whatever the struggle, your only hope is to give it your best shot.\n\n This film is probably the weakest of the five films in the Rocky series. Yet there are some very good parts to it. The way we see Rocky get over bankruptcy was very good, as is the way he eventually makes his family the most important thing in his life. Again I found this story to be good, though I guess it lacked that real Rocky feel to it, mainly because the champ was unwilling or unable to get into the ring. Stallone has done a grand job in being the writer of all the Rocky films. \n\nThe cast make a final appearance, that is reasonably good. Stallone is good as Rocky once again. His character is still trying to make a contribution to fighting, after being told that he can no longer professionally fight in the ring. So he helps out fresh talent, Tommy Machine' Gunn, who is acted by real life boxer Tommy Morrison. I found this character to be just far to arrogant and stubborn, which in a way did not suit being a part of the Balboa corner. Tommy has had an interesting life, not only fighting wise, but in a personal way. He has been caught in drug rackets, drink driving and admitted to the world that he has contracted the fatal HIV virus. I am not so sure he is the greatest of actors though.\n\nThe normal cast members were good. Talia Shire's character Adrian, lets the world know that her husband is finished boxing and has nothing else to prove in the boxing ring. Making a special appearance was star from the first three films, that of Burgess Meredith. Just seeing him onscreen was really satisfying. Mickey was a favourite character of mine. I must mention that I liked seeing Stallone's very own son Sage, in Rocky as Rocky's son, Rocky Jnr. He was pretty good as the son that felt left out in the cold. He also has a mean punch like the old man as well. \n\nI found that all the Rocky films had terrific soundtracks. This is due to the great work by composer, Bill Conti. Bill has done a wonderful job in organising the music to go with all the fighting scenes and the poignant scenes which require that tune to set them off just nicely. Rocky five had probably the best song on any of the soundtracks, that being the Elton John hit Measure of a man'. I think it is a wonderful song, with some terrific lyrics. I have loved most of the music that the Rocky movies have given us.\n\nRocky V might not be the best movie ever made, but it certainly had some sort of impact on me. I believe if a movie only makes a slight impression on you, then it has achieved in a small way what it was meant to do.

When you're down and out, the best shot is, simply, to   Go for it!","reviewBody":"When a doctor or a family member tells you that the only life you have ever know is over, that can be a pretty bitter pill too swallow. In Rocky V, Rocky Balboa is faced with such a scenario. This movie proves to me that you need to have more than one string to your arrow, as you never know when it might come in handy one day. Rocky V also points out that money and possession are not the important things in life, but family and (true) friends are!\n\nLosing it all does not mean a thing unless you've got something to lose  And Rocky Balboa had it all. Times have changed, though, for former Heavyweight champion of the world. A lifetime of fighting has taken its toll, mentally and physically, and the maneuverings of an scrupulous accountant have left him financially strapped. But resiliency and the ability to come back have been trademarks of the Rocky legend. Just when it looks like the champ is down for the count, he discovers the raw talent of a young fighter named Tommy Gunn, who just might be Rocky's last chance for glory. In a world where achievement is marked by dollars and cents, and in a profession where success is measured in wins and losses, Rocky Balboa knows that, whatever the struggle, your only hope is to give it your best shot.\n\n This film is probably the weakest of the five films in the Rocky series. Yet there are some very good parts to it. The way we see Rocky get over bankruptcy was very good, as is the way he eventually makes his family the most important thing in his life. Again I found this story to be good, though I guess it lacked that real Rocky feel to it, mainly because the champ was unwilling or unable to get into the ring. Stallone has done a grand job in being the writer of all the Rocky films. \n\nThe cast make a final appearance, that is reasonably good. Stallone is good as Rocky once again. His character is still trying to make a contribution to fighting, after being told that he can no longer professionally fight in the ring. So he helps out fresh talent, Tommy Machine' Gunn, who is acted by real life boxer Tommy Morrison. I found this character to be just far to arrogant and stubborn, which in a way did not suit being a part of the Balboa corner. Tommy has had an interesting life, not only fighting wise, but in a personal way. He has been caught in drug rackets, drink driving and admitted to the world that he has contracted the fatal HIV virus. I am not so sure he is the greatest of actors though.\n\nThe normal cast members were good. Talia Shire's character Adrian, lets the world know that her husband is finished boxing and has nothing else to prove in the boxing ring. Making a special appearance was star from the first three films, that of Burgess Meredith. Just seeing him onscreen was really satisfying. Mickey was a favourite character of mine. I must mention that I liked seeing Stallone's very own son Sage, in Rocky as Rocky's son, Rocky Jnr. He was pretty good as the son that felt left out in the cold. He also has a mean punch like the old man as well. \n\nI found that all the Rocky films had terrific soundtracks. This is due to the great work by composer, Bill Conti. Bill has done a wonderful job in organising the music to go with all the fighting scenes and the poignant scenes which require that tune to set them off just nicely. Rocky five had probably the best song on any of the soundtracks, that being the Elton John hit Measure of a man'. I think it is a wonderful song, with some terrific lyrics. I have loved most of the music that the Rocky movies have given us.\n\nRocky V might not be the best movie ever made, but it certainly had some sort of impact on me. I believe if a movie only makes a slight impression on you, then it has achieved in a small way what it was meant to do. I heard that plans for Rocky VI were being made, with a script finished by Stallone just a few years ago. Personally, I feel that if it was to be made it would not be that great a film, because Balboa can no longer make a comeback in the ring, and if he does, he could well become  as his wife said disabled'. All things being said, these films are a terrific avenue of motivation and can help any person get the spark back to turn their luck around in any venture they pursue.\n\nRating 3 Stars or 6.5/10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":132607,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1990-11-16","keywords":"rocky balboa jr character,rocky balboa character,adrian character,paulie character,mickey goldmill character","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

Also unlike a lot of people in here I am really glad they did not change the story from the original. Since it is a remake I don't expect a whole new story that would totally ruin the original. Besides, with the money Disney has made, a 2nd one is definitely coming, you'll get your different story. The visuals were OK but could have been better especially Belle's village.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":290795,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-03-17","keywords":"beast,fairy tale,heroine,beast's heart,remake of oscar winner","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For Your Consideration Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179222553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As punishment for his actions, a young prince is transformed into a monstrous beast by a mysterious enchantress.

It stands alone in its appeal to people of all ages and in its presentation of comedy, romance, and creative story line.  Shrek is a delightful comedy about a crude ogre, an energetic princess, a witty donkey and an uptight ruler.    The movie has a brilliant story line, following the path of an initially moody ogre as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy.  The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages.  One clever tool Shrek uses to humor the audience is its spoof on other fairy tales.  In one scene, Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode.  And in another scene, the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White is "She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled, she's not easy."

It stands alone in its appeal to people of all ages and in its presentation of comedy, romance, and creative story line.  Shrek is a delightful comedy about a crude ogre, an energetic princess, a witty donkey and an uptight ruler.    The movie has a brilliant story line, following the path of an initially moody ogre as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy.  The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages.  One clever tool Shrek uses to humor the audience is its spoof on other fairy tales.  In one scene, Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode.  And in another scene, the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White is "She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled, she's not easy."  While these subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the movie opening with the ogre sitting in a swamp "farting," that amuses children.  The amazing cast of Shrek, including Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers does a great job of living up to their comedic expectations.

The days of her famed discoveries behind her, she now hunts for common fossils to sell to rich tourists to support herself and her ailing widowed mother. When one such tourist, Roderick Murchison, arrives in Lyme on the first leg of a European tour, he entrusts Mary with the care of his young wife Charlotte, who is recuperating from a personal tragedy. Mary, whose life is a daily struggle on the poverty line, cannot afford to turn him down but, proud and relentlessly passionate about her work, she clashes with her unwanted guest. They are two women from utterly different worlds. Yet despite the chasm between their social spheres and personalities, Mary and Charlotte discover they can each offer what the other has been searching for: the realisation that they are not alone. It is the beginning of a passionate and all-consuming love affair that will defy all social bounds and alter the course of both lives irrevocably."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519680/","name":"Saoirse Ronan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0428121/","name":"Gemma Jones"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0497274/","name":"Francis Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037450/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605911/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0497274/","name":"Francis Lee"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The days of her famed discoveries behind her, she now hunts for common fossils to sell to rich tourists to support herself and her ailing widowed mother. When one such tourist, Roderick Murchison, arrives in Lyme on the first leg of a European tour, he entrusts Mary with the care of his young wife Charlotte, who is recuperating from a personal tragedy. Mary, whose life is a daily struggle on the poverty line, cannot afford to turn him down but, proud and relentlessly passionate about her work, she clashes with her unwanted guest. They are two women from utterly different worlds. Yet despite the chasm between their social spheres and personalities, Mary and Charlotte discover they can each offer what the other has been searching for: the realisation that they are not alone. It is the beginning of a passionate and all-consuming love affair that will defy all social bounds and alter the course of both lives irrevocably.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519680/","name":"Saoirse Ronan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0428121/","name":"Gemma Jones"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0497274/","name":"Francis Lee"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037450/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605911/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0497274/","name":"Francis Lee"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is a bizarre film, unnecessarily complicated, that assembles a top-notch cast, puts them into a tense situation with all the players in place, and then has nothing to do with them. It's like the writer forgot that you needed a third act; it's all rising action with no denouement.\n\nWashington plays Det. Frazier, a hostage negotiator who acts, literally, as if this is his first case. He has the obligatory younger partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor, "Serenity") who exists so Frazier can explain his theories and the obligatory ESU commander who wants to go in and shoot everyone (Willem Dafoe, sadly underused). Owen plays the bank robber, about whom frustratingly nothing is known except what he said into the camera in the trailer. Finally, Foster plays some sort of player amongst the Powers That Be who walks into the mayor's office, demands an update, and is given "every possible courtesy", etc. She serves no purpose whatsoever, not even in a clichéd action movie type of way like Dafoe and Ejiofor. The performances are the only good part of the movie, but there are times when you can tell that the actors wished they were in a better film. They're giving it their all, and they're getting no help from anyone else involved.\n\nSpike Lee is up to his usual tricks here, which, in this type of movie, is a very bad thing. The details of the heist itself I won't disclose. I can't. The action is, at best, vague - extremely brief scenes of vaults opening, hole-digging, hostage roughing up, and the usual bank-robber stuff are all the details we really get. It is also inter cut with scenes of the hostages recalling the heist; their recollections serve no purpose except to confuse the audience further. "Inside Man" is curiously racist: the white crooks rough up the black bank customers, the white Foster and the mayor order around Washington, the white cops mistake a Sikh for an Arab and beat him, and even a Jewish hostage was not only a lawyer, but has a nephew who is a jeweler. Washington and Ejiofor are given no flaws whatsoever and are seen mostly being pushed around by everyone else in the movie. The action repeatedly grinds to a halt so Lee can insert quirky little subplots involving video games, Washington's much younger girlfriend and random Albanian women. They're at best unnecessary, at worst, disastrous. If we had been given a director with more focus, there is the feeling that this could have been a lean, mean thriller. But it drags and drags and drags and when we get to the end, we understand why the film stalled for so long: the ending is about as climatic as erectile dysfunction.\n\n"Inside Man" looked like it had it all - great cast, good concept, reputable director, but the end result is a near-disaster. It's like someone threw "Dog Day Afternoon" into a blender, drank it, and vomited it back onto the screen. As I stumbled out of the theater, deprived of my money and time, I cursed the screen gods who thought to tease me with such an improbably bad movie.

This ill conceived, miscast, puerile piece of garbage has very little to do with the late Mr. Porter's actual life and even less to do with his music. The movie even admits on a certain level that it's a fake by using footage from another horribly miscast biopic about Cole Porter, starring Cary Grant and Alexis Smith! \n\nAnother review I've read mentions that: "At the first night parties there seemed a disproportionately high number of black people as guests, and also in other scenes." Historical documentation supports that Cole Porter's life, especially while in New York, was more integrated than a casual observer might think. On the contrary, there were many black people who attended the late Mr. Porter's, shall we say..."Night Parties". Primarily Black male prostitutes whom he patronized at the Harlem brothels he frequented. A few, even served as inspiration for some of his more popular songs. This subject, which is a key part of Cole Porter's life, is conveniently leeched out of the story.\n\nThis isn't the only bone of contention I have with this movie. Much of the movie's music is taken out of context, not only chronologically, but also stylistically and logistically. He wrote songs for key reasons at key times. For instance, the very woman who was supposed to have inspired this movie, Cole Porter's wife Linda, also was reported to have given the song "De-lovely", its name. This is referenced in many notable biographies of Cole Porter.\n\nIf you actually want to know about his real life and his REAL music, go to the library and read for yourself about the actual person. Then, start by listening to his music. Ella Fitzgerald's Cole porter songbook serves as an excellent introduction. And if you're still intrigued, there are actual recordings of the late Mr. Porter playing and singing his own music. If you're reading this, you've obviously got online access, so do yourself a huge favor, start by visiting some of the online multi-media, book and music outlets and enter his name in a search. For the time investment of a few simple key-strokes and mouse clicks, you'll be able to learn and truly appreciate more about Cole Porter, his life, his music and his genius, than this blanched, consumptive Kevin Kline vehicle could ever hope to provide."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11229,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2004-08-06","keywords":"jukebox musical,horseback riding,cole porter character,monty woolley character,louis b. mayer character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4233871641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000177/","name":"Kevin Kline"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000171/","name":"Ashley Judd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098170/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049390/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168379/","name":"Jay Cocks"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Inspecting a magical biographical stage musical, composer Cole Porter reviews his life and career with his wife, Linda." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0352277/","name":"De-Lovely","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyODgwODIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTkzMTczMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspecting a magical biographical stage musical, composer Cole Porter reviews his life and career with his wife, Linda.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0352277/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"mcpsy","dateCreated":"2004-12-08","inLanguage":"English","name":"Delirious: Hollywood gets it wrong again!","reviewBody":"I say "Delirious", because evidently, the people involved in this mess must've been just that. This ill conceived, miscast, puerile piece of garbage has very little to do with the late Mr. Porter's actual life and even less to do with his music. The movie even admits on a certain level that it's a fake by using footage from another horribly miscast biopic about Cole Porter, starring Cary Grant and Alexis Smith! \n\nAnother review I've read mentions that: "At the first night parties there seemed a disproportionately high number of black people as guests, and also in other scenes." Historical documentation supports that Cole Porter's life, especially while in New York, was more integrated than a casual observer might think. On the contrary, there were many black people who attended the late Mr. Porter's, shall we say..."Night Parties". Primarily Black male prostitutes whom he patronized at the Harlem brothels he frequented. A few, even served as inspiration for some of his more popular songs. This subject, which is a key part of Cole Porter's life, is conveniently leeched out of the story.\n\nThis isn't the only bone of contention I have with this movie. Much of the movie's music is taken out of context, not only chronologically, but also stylistically and logistically. He wrote songs for key reasons at key times. For instance, the very woman who was supposed to have inspired this movie, Cole Porter's wife Linda, also was reported to have given the song "De-lovely", its name. This is referenced in many notable biographies of Cole Porter.\n\nIf you actually want to know about his real life and his REAL music, go to the library and read for yourself about the actual person. Then, start by listening to his music. Ella Fitzgerald's Cole porter songbook serves as an excellent introduction. And if you're still intrigued, there are actual recordings of the late Mr. Porter playing and singing his own music. If you're reading this, you've obviously got online access, so do yourself a huge favor, start by visiting some of the online multi-media, book and music outlets and enter his name in a search. For the time investment of a few simple key-strokes and mouse clicks, you'll be able to learn and truly appreciate more about Cole Porter, his life, his music and his genius, than this blanched, consumptive Kevin Kline vehicle could ever hope to provide.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11229,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2004-08-06","keywords":"jukebox musical,horseback riding,cole porter character,monty woolley character,louis b. mayer character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4233871641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000177/","name":"Kevin Kline","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000171/","name":"Ashley Judd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098170/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049390/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168379/","name":"Jay Cocks"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over. Google it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":795708,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,despair","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over. Google it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":795708,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,despair","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I love to watch a good chic-flick. However, I was so disappointed. This movie has little to offer except constantly changing 'bizarre' costuming presented as high fashion and thoroughly embarrassing 'ugly American' scenes of over-indulged, entitled and rudely written characters. I went to the theater to enjoy a fun movie. I came away shaking my head. The movie was disrespectful to me as an American woman. Who acts like Samantha when in a foreign country, the Middle East or otherwise? As I watched the characters make total asses of themselves I was embarrassed for them simply sitting in the theater.

This movie has little to offer except constantly changing 'bizarre' costuming presented as high fashion and thoroughly embarrassing 'ugly American' scenes of over-indulged, entitled and rudely written characters. I went to the theater to enjoy a fun movie. I came away shaking my head. The movie was disrespectful to me as an American woman. Who acts like Samantha when in a foreign country, the Middle East or otherwise? As I watched the characters make total asses of themselves I was embarrassed for them simply sitting in the theater.

But, like "The Phantom Menace," I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was "How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?" rather than "How entertaining is this film overall?" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.\n\nCritics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like "The Wizard of Oz" and "Mary Poppins," are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.\n\nAs a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, "Adventures in Babysitting"), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.\n\nI had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like "Home Alone" and "Mrs. Doubtfire." Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.\n\nBut much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--"Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers"--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.\n\nNot that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.\n\nThe problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary "muggle" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.\n\nAlthough the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.\n\nThe answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.\n\nWhat we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":707053,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-01-16","keywords":"magic,wizard,school of magic,based on novel,orphan","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter Franchise Retrospective","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3286287129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDRlYzU0YWMtYTU3My00ZmEyLWE1NzEtZTk1MDNmMzE2N2RhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1pYnJ5YW50._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDRlYzU0YWMtYTU3My00ZmEyLWE1NzEtZTk1MDNmMzE2N2RhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1pYnJ5YW50._V1_.jpg","description":""That's why you're famous, Harry, that's why everybody knows your name.

Indeed, many classic children's movies, like "The Wizard of Oz" and "Mary Poppins," are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.\n\nAs a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, "Adventures in Babysitting"), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.\n\nI had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like "Home Alone" and "Mrs. Doubtfire." Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.\n\nBut much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--"Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers"--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.\n\nNot that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.\n\nThe problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary "muggle" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.\n\nAlthough the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.\n\nThe answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.\n\nWhat we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":707053,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-01-16","keywords":"magic,wizard,school of magic,based on novel,orphan","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter Franchise Retrospective","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3286287129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDRlYzU0YWMtYTU3My00ZmEyLWE1NzEtZTk1MDNmMzE2N2RhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1pYnJ5YW50._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDRlYzU0YWMtYTU3My00ZmEyLWE1NzEtZTk1MDNmMzE2N2RhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1pYnJ5YW50._V1_.jpg","description":""That's why you're famous, Harry, that's why everybody knows your name.

In 'Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban', the trio are now thirteen and beginning their Third Year at Hogwarts, under the fear of an escaped criminal who played a part in the deaths of Harry's parents and seems to be stalking the school, preying on Harry.\n\nThe child acting in this film has improved slightly with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint probably faring the best in comparison to their young co-stars. Although he is lumbered with a Ron who has once again been reduced to a comic character, it's a sign of Grint's abilities that he does well without looking embarrassed or too clownish. Dan Radcliffe was still very poor, obviously struggling to portray Harry's darker emotions in a manner that isn't wooden and awkward and and this was very apparent in the scene where he makes an atrocious effort to cry when he finds out his godfather had betrayed his parents to their deaths. while Tom Felton was let down by poor scripting of Draco.\n\nThe adult cast were excellent. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black were perfectly cast. Lupin was soft yet stern when needed and you could feel there was a parental rapport between him and Harry, and I couldn't imagine anyone other than David Thewlis in the role. And Gary Oldman was great in depicting Black's determination, mingled with an hysterical madness due to his incarceration in the hellish wizarding prison Azkaban. As for Michael Gambon, who was recast in the role of Dumbledore, I felt he was an improvement. Richard Harris was a gifted actor but his Dumbledore had a cold, aloofness to him whereas Gambon was able to portray the warm, eccentricity of the character without diminishing the power and wisdom of Dumbledore. And the rest of the regular cast, such as Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith, were perfect although we expect no better from them now!\n\nOne of the best aspects of this film is how it no longer pandered to kiddies like the previous two films did. There was a darker, moodier edge to the story and the characters. The wizarding world no longer seemed like a perfect haven and the characters had grown beyond being innocent children; this reflected the book itself since many feel PoA was a turning point in the series where it finally felt like Harry Potter- boy and book- were growing up. The Hogwarts' setting differed from the previous films yet not only was it definitely more faithful to the books but finally it felt as if the castle was in Scotland rather than perpetually sunny Disney Land and this enhanced the mood being set in the film. The clock was a nice touch, linking to the theme of time in the actual storyline, as was the bridge in being a place for Harry to mull over his problems. Also, in many ways, this film could have ended up a muddled mess in regards to the ending but Cuaron handled the Time Turner scenes well.\n\nHowever, there were flaws to the film, which let it down. The characters of Hermione and Draco were poorly scripted so they seemed like two completely different characters from the ones we know and love in the books. Although Watson as an actress has improved since CoS, the main problem with the script is that Hermione is being portrayed as being too cool and cocky compared to the bookworm who has no interest in fashion that we know Hermione to be in the books. Steve Kloves, the scriptwriter who admits he's responsible for the change, really needs to learn heroines don't need to be cool Buffy types to be admired; part of why Hermione is so popular as a character in the books is that she appeals to girls who are bookish themselves and easily identify with her. And as for Draco, he comes across as too much of a cowardly, weak girlie-boy rather than an insidious, vicious brat who can be a threat to Harry when he chooses to. \n\nAlso, there was no telling of what Black did to Snape in school that left him so bitter in his hatred and I wished they'd included the scene where he let slip what Lupin was, especially as this animosity between him, Black and Lupin plays a larger role as the books go on. And speaking of Lupin, the werewolf CGI was atrocious. He looked like an emaciated rat rather than the wolf-like creature who leaves even the more powerful wizards quivering in fear. I wished there was more in the ending too as I would have loved to see Vernon's face when he found out who Black was. Kloves needs to learn how to round the Harry Potter films off properly as this was also a sticking point in CoS.\n\nAt the end of the day, there were scenes left out, some of which we didn't mind skipping but others (an explanation to Harry of James Potter's friendship to Black and Lupin) were sorely missed. It was a great film but it could have done with being made longer or skipping on non-essential scenes (less of the Knight Bus and Hermione punching Malfoy in a manner that makes her out to be a thug) to make way for scenes which are more important. I think I was disappointed because I was expecting something along the lines of RotK but it's still great viewing. I'd give it a seven-and-a-half out of ten with the hopes Cuaron will return to the helm again although preferably not with Kloves as the scriptwriter. I think Cuaron would be excellent working with a script produced by someone who has a better handle on the darker aspects of the books and a deeper understanding of the HP characters.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":585447,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-06-03","keywords":"magic,wizard,werewolf,rat,school of magic","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2007761177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

In 'Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban', the trio are now thirteen and beginning their Third Year at Hogwarts, under the fear of an escaped criminal who played a part in the deaths of Harry's parents and seems to be stalking the school, preying on Harry.\n\nThe child acting in this film has improved slightly with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint probably faring the best in comparison to their young co-stars. Although he is lumbered with a Ron who has once again been reduced to a comic character, it's a sign of Grint's abilities that he does well without looking embarrassed or too clownish. Dan Radcliffe was still very poor, obviously struggling to portray Harry's darker emotions in a manner that isn't wooden and awkward and and this was very apparent in the scene where he makes an atrocious effort to cry when he finds out his godfather had betrayed his parents to their deaths. while Tom Felton was let down by poor scripting of Draco.\n\nThe adult cast were excellent. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black were perfectly cast. Lupin was soft yet stern when needed and you could feel there was a parental rapport between him and Harry, and I couldn't imagine anyone other than David Thewlis in the role. And Gary Oldman was great in depicting Black's determination, mingled with an hysterical madness due to his incarceration in the hellish wizarding prison Azkaban. As for Michael Gambon, who was recast in the role of Dumbledore, I felt he was an improvement. Richard Harris was a gifted actor but his Dumbledore had a cold, aloofness to him whereas Gambon was able to portray the warm, eccentricity of the character without diminishing the power and wisdom of Dumbledore. And the rest of the regular cast, such as Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith, were perfect although we expect no better from them now!\n\nOne of the best aspects of this film is how it no longer pandered to kiddies like the previous two films did. There was a darker, moodier edge to the story and the characters. The wizarding world no longer seemed like a perfect haven and the characters had grown beyond being innocent children; this reflected the book itself since many feel PoA was a turning point in the series where it finally felt like Harry Potter- boy and book- were growing up. The Hogwarts' setting differed from the previous films yet not only was it definitely more faithful to the books but finally it felt as if the castle was in Scotland rather than perpetually sunny Disney Land and this enhanced the mood being set in the film. The clock was a nice touch, linking to the theme of time in the actual storyline, as was the bridge in being a place for Harry to mull over his problems. Also, in many ways, this film could have ended up a muddled mess in regards to the ending but Cuaron handled the Time Turner scenes well.\n\nHowever, there were flaws to the film, which let it down. The characters of Hermione and Draco were poorly scripted so they seemed like two completely different characters from the ones we know and love in the books. Although Watson as an actress has improved since CoS, the main problem with the script is that Hermione is being portrayed as being too cool and cocky compared to the bookworm who has no interest in fashion that we know Hermione to be in the books. Steve Kloves, the scriptwriter who admits he's responsible for the change, really needs to learn heroines don't need to be cool Buffy types to be admired; part of why Hermione is so popular as a character in the books is that she appeals to girls who are bookish themselves and easily identify with her. And as for Draco, he comes across as too much of a cowardly, weak girlie-boy rather than an insidious, vicious brat who can be a threat to Harry when he chooses to. \n\nAlso, there was no telling of what Black did to Snape in school that left him so bitter in his hatred and I wished they'd included the scene where he let slip what Lupin was, especially as this animosity between him, Black and Lupin plays a larger role as the books go on. And speaking of Lupin, the werewolf CGI was atrocious. He looked like an emaciated rat rather than the wolf-like creature who leaves even the more powerful wizards quivering in fear. I wished there was more in the ending too as I would have loved to see Vernon's face when he found out who Black was. Kloves needs to learn how to round the Harry Potter films off properly as this was also a sticking point in CoS.\n\nAt the end of the day, there were scenes left out, some of which we didn't mind skipping but others (an explanation to Harry of James Potter's friendship to Black and Lupin) were sorely missed. It was a great film but it could have done with being made longer or skipping on non-essential scenes (less of the Knight Bus and Hermione punching Malfoy in a manner that makes her out to be a thug) to make way for scenes which are more important. I think I was disappointed because I was expecting something along the lines of RotK but it's still great viewing. I'd give it a seven-and-a-half out of ten with the hopes Cuaron will return to the helm again although preferably not with Kloves as the scriptwriter. I think Cuaron would be excellent working with a script produced by someone who has a better handle on the darker aspects of the books and a deeper understanding of the HP characters.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":585447,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-06-03","keywords":"magic,wizard,werewolf,rat,school of magic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2007761177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

HBO donosi premijeru nove sezone "Emmyjem" nagrađene humoristične serije autora Armanda Iannuccija koja na oštar i satiričan način promatra zatvoreni politički svijet Washingtona. U seriji pratimo vrtoglavu svakodnevicu potpredsjednice Seline Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus u ulozi koja joj je donijela "Emmy") dok balansira sa svojim pretrpanim javnim rasporedom, gasi političke požare i brani predsjednikove interese, te istodobno pokušava popraviti svoj disfunkcionalni odnos s njime. Priča se nastavlja usred izbora u sredini mandata, a u 2. sezoni Selina kotira malo iznad prosjeka na nekoliko anketa o popularnosti, što iskorištava kako bi povećala svoj utjecaj i ulagivala se predsjedniku i njegovu novom glavnom strategu Kentu Davisonu (Gary Cole).</desc>

Now i love a good coming-of-age story, so when one is done right and is new and interesting it will probably be something i choose to watch more than once. Unfortunately this will not be one i am eager to re-watch but it is still a good, strong attempt at one of these films but it seems to get lost a few times along the way in terms of its storytelling. I'll start with the characters and performances, because i feel they were definitely the best parts of the film and added so much to making the film pretty enjoyable. Nat Wolff was great at playing Quentin, a shy awkward guy who had a signs of a lot of personality but needed the right people to bring it out. You really get to connect with his character as they made him come across as very real and not like a character per se. I may say that often but there are so many young actors really showing off their best stuff in these smaller personal films. Cara Delevingne was also great as Margo who was also quite odd and mysterious but was also very out there and confident at the same time, a great contrast to Nat's character. The rest of the supporting cast were also well acted, their distinct personalities were at times used for some cheap comedic relief but also had a greater purpose in adding to the complexity of our main character.\n\nThe first act of this film is really where the film gets to shine. You get the introduction to these characters (Quentin and Margo) and get to see their relationship and how it has changed and affected both these characters in the lead up to the events in the film. Watching them interact and bond was fascinating and charming at times and was a really good lead up into the events of the second act and understanding their actions. It was fun, light-hearted and was setting itself up for something great. All of the events so far had a fluid lead in to the second act which became more of a mysterious adventure whilst still trying to maintain that fun element somewhat unsuccessfully. The events of the first act are what get you through the very long second act that could have been cut down like 20 minutes. The second act was more focused on building up Quentin's character and having him face some tough and new decisions in his life. Although it was interesting and you do want to see where his character goes it was a noticeable step down from the fun light-hearted enjoyment in the beginning. There was this great interesting relationship set up and you are eager to find out how the film ties everything together, then you reach the third act and all of the storytelling falls apart. \n\nFor certain characters, their actions and reactions seem somewhat justified but for some others they just felt like another character entirely. There was nothing in the second act that really explained how or why these characters made such a drastic change in reasoning or personality. They try to explain it in the dying minutes but it was very rushed and didn't fit with the rest of the film. The problem was that there was no real progression from the events of the beginning to the events in the end for some characters and that led me to believe that the writers/directors knew how to approach certain sections but were completely lost for others. I believe, they knew how they wanted the film to begin and how to introduce these characters, and they also knew how they wanted it to end and what themes they wanted to explore. But what they didn't know was how to show that transition, and when a film has the beginning, and has the end it can be hard to fill in the guts of the film afterwards and show a distinct character progression. That's just my theory but whatever happened the storytelling was a bit of a mess. \n\nThat being said, it was still a good enjoyable film that tried too hard to be different or maybe not hard enough.

Now i love a good coming-of-age story, so when one is done right and is new and interesting it will probably be something i choose to watch more than once. Unfortunately this will not be one i am eager to re-watch but it is still a good, strong attempt at one of these films but it seems to get lost a few times along the way in terms of its storytelling. I'll start with the characters and performances, because i feel they were definitely the best parts of the film and added so much to making the film pretty enjoyable. Nat Wolff was great at playing Quentin, a shy awkward guy who had a signs of a lot of personality but needed the right people to bring it out. You really get to connect with his character as they made him come across as very real and not like a character per se. I may say that often but there are so many young actors really showing off their best stuff in these smaller personal films. Cara Delevingne was also great as Margo who was also quite odd and mysterious but was also very out there and confident at the same time, a great contrast to Nat's character. The rest of the supporting cast were also well acted, their distinct personalities were at times used for some cheap comedic relief but also had a greater purpose in adding to the complexity of our main character.\n\nThe first act of this film is really where the film gets to shine. You get the introduction to these characters (Quentin and Margo) and get to see their relationship and how it has changed and affected both these characters in the lead up to the events in the film. Watching them interact and bond was fascinating and charming at times and was a really good lead up into the events of the second act and understanding their actions. It was fun, light-hearted and was setting itself up for something great. All of the events so far had a fluid lead in to the second act which became more of a mysterious adventure whilst still trying to maintain that fun element somewhat unsuccessfully. The events of the first act are what get you through the very long second act that could have been cut down like 20 minutes. The second act was more focused on building up Quentin's character and having him face some tough and new decisions in his life. Although it was interesting and you do want to see where his character goes it was a noticeable step down from the fun light-hearted enjoyment in the beginning. There was this great interesting relationship set up and you are eager to find out how the film ties everything together, then you reach the third act and all of the storytelling falls apart. \n\nFor certain characters, their actions and reactions seem somewhat justified but for some others they just felt like another character entirely. There was nothing in the second act that really explained how or why these characters made such a drastic change in reasoning or personality. They try to explain it in the dying minutes but it was very rushed and didn't fit with the rest of the film. The problem was that there was no real progression from the events of the beginning to the events in the end for some characters and that led me to believe that the writers/directors knew how to approach certain sections but were completely lost for others. I believe, they knew how they wanted the film to begin and how to introduce these characters, and they also knew how they wanted it to end and what themes they wanted to explore. But what they didn't know was how to show that transition, and when a film has the beginning, and has the end it can be hard to fill in the guts of the film afterwards and show a distinct character progression. That's just my theory but whatever happened the storytelling was a bit of a mess. \n\nThat being said, it was still a good enjoyable film that tried too hard to be different or maybe not hard enough. It had great characters and performances, a fantastic first act, an interesting second act and a third act that didn't live up to what the rest of the film was building up to. Humour didn't really work that often but kept the film from becoming too dark, and there were signs of emotion but nothing that really affects you. In the end, it's enjoyable but there are better coming-of-age films out there (Boyhood / Me and Earl and the Dying Girl). - 6.3","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99680,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

"Pravi detektiv" vraća se s trećom sezonom koja se usredotočuje na novi slučaj i predstavlja impresivnu novu glumačku postavu. Mahershala Ali igra glavnu ulogu Waynea Haysa, umirovljenog detektiva kojeg 35 godina muči slučaj nestanka 12-godišnjeg dječaka i njegove 10-godišnje sestre u gradu West Finger u Arkansasu. Dok ostarjeli Hays kontemplira o svojoj istrazi s producentom dokumentarca o stvarnim zločinima, saznajemo više o slučaju i Haysovoj prošlosti prateći priče iz 1980., kad se zločin dogodio, i 1990., kad je šokantno otkriće ponovno probudilo interes za slučaj. Kroz ove flashbackove upoznajemo ključne likove poput Rolanda Westa, Wayneova partnera u vrijeme ubojstva; Amelije Reardon, učiteljice kao i okružne dužnosnike, FBI-eve agente, članove obitelji i osumnjičene.</desc>

For the most part it's a miss, we RARELY have a funny or original romantic comedy. It's been over a year since we've had a good romantic comedy and this year seems to be pushing the horrible movies of this genre. For example, we had The Proposal that was released this year and it was just awful and so simple. The Ugly Truth seemed to be heading the same way when I first saw the trailer, but when I learned that it was Rated R, I decided to try to give it a chance. Honestly, this movie was a lot better than I had expected, it actually had some really great laughs and is a heck a lot better than The Proposal. But once again The Ugly Truth fell back into the ugly formula of clichés that are just annoying and there were quite a few things that I would have done differently with the story, I'll first explain the plot.\n\nAbby, a TV producer, is coming home from another disastrous date one night, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, "The Ugly Truth," run by Mike Chadway, whose cynicism of relationships prompts Abby to call into the show to argue with him on-air. The next day, she discovers that the station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings, and the station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show to bring them back up. At first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds Abby to be a control freak. However she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin living next to her, and Mike persuades her to follow his lead. She agrees to his helpful advice and if he can get her the man she wants, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to quit; he successfully guides Abby to be exactly what Colin would want. But being a romantic comedy, Abby and Mike instead fall for each other as usual, you know how the story goes.\n\nNow things I would've done different, if you don't want spoilers then don't read on: there is a child that comes into Mike's apartment, he and Mike get along great, I'm thinking that's his son; instead it's his nephew. I think this would have added substance to his character and made him more likable and would have had a better story on why he was so bitter on women, maybe like the mother left him or something. Second: I honestly would have had Abby chosen the doctor over Mike. Katherine and Gerad are great on screen together, but their chemistry for this film I felt was more of a great friendship than falling in love with each other. Her choosing Mike over the doctor was so typical, I would have had the doctor find out about what was going on and then take her back realizing that he still liked her very much and then Mike ends up with some slutty girl as usual happy with his shallow life, but still enjoying it. Third: no tired formulas, no girl best friend supporting everything the lead female does, no big kiss in front of an audience, no dramatic of finding out what a kiss meant. Fourth: why do we have gorgeous people claiming they have a hard time finding love or supposedly not having sex for a year? I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm finding it hard to believe that girls who look like Katherine Heigl are having the hardest time finding love.\n\nBut there are some positives in the film, honestly I did have a good time watching this film over all, it was just the ending that killed the movie. But even the little rip off of When Harry Met Sally where Abby is wearing vibrating panties at a company dinner and someone saying what was in her food to have the same effect, it's an old joke but it never gets old. I loved that this was a Rated R rom-com because the reason MOST of these movies don't work are due to the fact that they're too family friendly and very much unrealistic. Not to say that The Ugly Truth is completely realistic, but more so than most films. We have some sick jokes but get a great laugh, Abby is going to a baseball game with Colin, her crush, and she accidentally spills her drink on his lap and starts rubbing his pants to clean them and the kiss cam lowers in on them with a bad angle looking like she's just having fun with his hot dog. Honestly I think most of the theater had a hard time catching their breath on that joke, no one could stop laughing. Katherine and Gerad do have great chemistry on screen, I just think it would have worked better as a friendship. So I would say this is better suited as a rental vs. a theater view. It's a lot better than I expected but had more potential as it falls back into the same old tired formula.\n\n6/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":211867,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-09-23","keywords":"bad date,tv show,nudity,wrapped in a towel,blonde","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Ugly Truth - Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3848143641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNTAyNTk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNTAyNTk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A macho morning TV show correspondent (Butler) makes a bet with his love-challenged producer (Heigl): If his tips on how to land and keep a guy don't work, he'll quit the business."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001337/","name":"Katherine Heigl"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0877430/","name":"Bree Turner"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525659/","name":"Robert Luketic"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2946831/","name":"Nicole Eastman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527581/","name":"Karen McCullah"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0809006/","name":"Kirsten Smith"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now i love a good coming-of-age story, so when one is done right and is new and interesting it will probably be something i choose to watch more than once. Unfortunately this will not be one i am eager to re-watch but it is still a good, strong attempt at one of these films but it seems to get lost a few times along the way in terms of its storytelling. I'll start with the characters and performances, because i feel they were definitely the best parts of the film and added so much to making the film pretty enjoyable. Nat Wolff was great at playing Quentin, a shy awkward guy who had a signs of a lot of personality but needed the right people to bring it out. You really get to connect with his character as they made him come across as very real and not like a character per se. I may say that often but there are so many young actors really showing off their best stuff in these smaller personal films. Cara Delevingne was also great as Margo who was also quite odd and mysterious but was also very out there and confident at the same time, a great contrast to Nat's character. The rest of the supporting cast were also well acted, their distinct personalities were at times used for some cheap comedic relief but also had a greater purpose in adding to the complexity of our main character.\n\nThe first act of this film is really where the film gets to shine. You get the introduction to these characters (Quentin and Margo) and get to see their relationship and how it has changed and affected both these characters in the lead up to the events in the film. Watching them interact and bond was fascinating and charming at times and was a really good lead up into the events of the second act and understanding their actions. It was fun, light-hearted and was setting itself up for something great. All of the events so far had a fluid lead in to the second act which became more of a mysterious adventure whilst still trying to maintain that fun element somewhat unsuccessfully. The events of the first act are what get you through the very long second act that could have been cut down like 20 minutes. The second act was more focused on building up Quentin's character and having him face some tough and new decisions in his life. Although it was interesting and you do want to see where his character goes it was a noticeable step down from the fun light-hearted enjoyment in the beginning. There was this great interesting relationship set up and you are eager to find out how the film ties everything together, then you reach the third act and all of the storytelling falls apart. \n\nFor certain characters, their actions and reactions seem somewhat justified but for some others they just felt like another character entirely. There was nothing in the second act that really explained how or why these characters made such a drastic change in reasoning or personality. They try to explain it in the dying minutes but it was very rushed and didn't fit with the rest of the film. The problem was that there was no real progression from the events of the beginning to the events in the end for some characters and that led me to believe that the writers/directors knew how to approach certain sections but were completely lost for others. I believe, they knew how they wanted the film to begin and how to introduce these characters, and they also knew how they wanted it to end and what themes they wanted to explore. But what they didn't know was how to show that transition, and when a film has the beginning, and has the end it can be hard to fill in the guts of the film afterwards and show a distinct character progression. That's just my theory but whatever happened the storytelling was a bit of a mess. \n\nThat being said, it was still a good enjoyable film that tried too hard to be different or maybe not hard enough. It had great characters and performances, a fantastic first act, an interesting second act and a third act that didn't live up to what the rest of the film was building up to. Humour didn't really work that often but kept the film from becoming too dark, and there were signs of emotion but nothing that really affects you. In the end, it's enjoyable but there are better coming-of-age films out there (Boyhood / Me and Earl and the Dying Girl). - 6.3","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99680,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

A wonderful actor.\n\nWhat struck me right away was the extremely good, scored intro, the music throughout Dystopia is of I am a genuine fan of classic horror, so I was a bit suspicious when I heard VIAPLAY was doing Dystopia but boy was I surprised for a number of reasons.\n\nThe first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that it truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is. The Director of Dystopia is Richard Jarnhed and I need to keep an eye out for his future endeavors as he is madly talented.\n\nAnd secondly this was directed by just one director. Richard directed all 8 episodes and that's not normal in Scandinavia.\n\nAnd lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.\n\nThe acting is wonderful and directing is amazing. I was totally blown away by the music!\n\nIt is always nice to see a TV-series with some twists, and also those that give you some food for thought.\n\nI am a bit blown away by the rather week reviews in Swedish press. One outlet even writes that it's outside the box and that they love the box. I am sure Dystopia will do very well internationally!\n\nIf you like Horror tension and at the same time mystery tension you should see Dystopia.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2300,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2021-06-13","keywords":"lesbian kiss,lesbian sex,topless female nudity,larp,larpers","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11198177/","name":"Lola Zackow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4477198/","name":"Madeleine Martin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7154476/","name":"Johan Hafezi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004517/"}]}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A wonderful actor.\n\nWhat struck me right away was the extremely good, scored intro, the music throughout Dystopia is of I am a genuine fan of classic horror, so I was a bit suspicious when I heard VIAPLAY was doing Dystopia but boy was I surprised for a number of reasons.\n\nThe first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that it truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is. The Director of Dystopia is Richard Jarnhed and I need to keep an eye out for his future endeavors as he is madly talented.\n\nAnd secondly this was directed by just one director. Richard directed all 8 episodes and that's not normal in Scandinavia.\n\nAnd lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.\n\nThe acting is wonderful and directing is amazing. I was totally blown away by the music!\n\nIt is always nice to see a TV-series with some twists, and also those that give you some food for thought.\n\nI am a bit blown away by the rather week reviews in Swedish press. One outlet even writes that it's outside the box and that they love the box. I am sure Dystopia will do very well internationally!\n\nIf you like Horror tension and at the same time mystery tension you should see Dystopia.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2300,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2021-06-13","keywords":"lesbian kiss,lesbian sex,topless female nudity,larp,larpers","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11198177/","name":"Lola Zackow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4477198/","name":"Madeleine Martin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7154476/","name":"Johan Hafezi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004517/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Day after day, night after night he takes the 2 am train to hell, where unsuspecting passengers are massacred and then hung up like dead meat.\n\nLeon (Bradley Cooper) is an up and coming photograph, who is trying to make it critically, but so far his work has been unable to break it. His biggest fan and believer is his beautiful fiancée Maya (Leslie Bibb). One chance session in the subway changes the direction of his life. First he photographs a model being harassed by some thugs and after saving her from them takes a picture of her entering the 2 am train...\n\nClive Barker has really been prolific with all the horror he has caused come to life on the big screen. It is enough to mention that his stories was the backbone of such classics as Hellraiser or Candyman. That said he has also been raped as a horror writer with atrocities such as Rawhead Rex.\n\nThis movie doesn't hit the highs or the lows, but I must say it was pretty decent and definitely one of the best genre movies I have seen lately. No matter has essentially idiotic the plot I have to say it did cut loose of the copycat phase in horror cinema we are currently at. It had a certain freshness to it not only in the way it was told, but also in subject matter itself. I won't go as far as to say it was breakthrough original, but it was darn intriguing all the way through.\n\nI normally rate a good horror movie based on gut feeling. The moment you can't wait to know what will happen at the end of the movie or in the next scene for that matter and at the same time you have to fight with yourself to continue watching - that lets you know this horror flick is actually pretty good.\n\nDefinitely full of flaws and the graphic gore isn't my kind of horror meal. Acting was great and tech credits all round were superb. Ryûhei Kitamura deserves accolades for this horror movie. Maybe not a classic, but given the far fetched material he had to work with it is a triumph.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":63002,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Horror"],"datePublished":"2008-10-31","keywords":"photographer,subway,butcher,dismemberment,art gallery","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Midnight Meat Train","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2259812633","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMjczNjY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcyNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMjczNjY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcyNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Midnight Meat Train - Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005068/","name":"Vinnie Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004753/","name":"Leslie Bibb"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457565/","name":"Ryûhei Kitamura"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165062/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1161528/","name":"Jeff Buhler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000850/","name":"Clive Barker"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Acting was great and tech credits all round were superb. Ryûhei Kitamura deserves accolades for this horror movie. Maybe not a classic, but given the far fetched material he had to work with it is a triumph.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":63002,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Horror"],"datePublished":"2008-10-31","keywords":"photographer,subway,butcher,dismemberment,art gallery","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Midnight Meat Train","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2259812633","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMjczNjY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcyNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMjczNjY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcyNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Midnight Meat Train - Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005068/","name":"Vinnie Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004753/","name":"Leslie Bibb"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457565/","name":"Ryûhei Kitamura"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165062/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1161528/","name":"Jeff Buhler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000850/","name":"Clive Barker"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
