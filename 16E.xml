It was a very good film and led to two sequels. However, the films are flawed in one way--they ignored the musicals of rival studios, such as RKO, MGM and Twentieth Century-Fox. So, for that reason alone, "Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical History" is a better film for someone wanting to learn about the history of this genre. Now I am not saying it's perfect--but it is darn good because its clips are not restricted to a single studio.\n\nSo what are the film's deficits and assets? Well, on the plus side, it not only talks about ALL the studio's musicals but it also extends to today, since it's a new film. Also, the interviews are quite nice and there are tons of clips. On the negative side, the clips were occasionally fuzzy (especially the earlier ones) and the film is NOT completely comprehensive. Many important films are omitted and you'd get the impression that Busby Berkeley did EVERY musical from the 30s (he actually did far less than most people think). But this can be forgiven, you the film was not intended as a mini-series (which it really needed for so much material). Unless you absolutely hate musicals, this film is for you and well worth seeing.\n\nBy the way, I really wished the film had talked about some of the flops of the genre--such as "Camelot", "Paint Your Wagon", "Can't Stop the Music" or "Xanadu" (among others). Now THAT would make for an interesting film!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":101,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"genre":["Documentary","Musical"],"datePublished":"2008-10-14","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0044762/","name":"Obba Babatundé"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000824/","name":"John Badham"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083306/","name":"Robert S.

It was a very good film and led to two sequels. However, the films are flawed in one way--they ignored the musicals of rival studios, such as RKO, MGM and Twentieth Century-Fox. So, for that reason alone, "Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical History" is a better film for someone wanting to learn about the history of this genre. Now I am not saying it's perfect--but it is darn good because its clips are not restricted to a single studio.\n\nSo what are the film's deficits and assets? Well, on the plus side, it not only talks about ALL the studio's musicals but it also extends to today, since it's a new film. Also, the interviews are quite nice and there are tons of clips. On the negative side, the clips were occasionally fuzzy (especially the earlier ones) and the film is NOT completely comprehensive. Many important films are omitted and you'd get the impression that Busby Berkeley did EVERY musical from the 30s (he actually did far less than most people think). But this can be forgiven, you the film was not intended as a mini-series (which it really needed for so much material). Unless you absolutely hate musicals, this film is for you and well worth seeing.\n\nBy the way, I really wished the film had talked about some of the flops of the genre--such as "Camelot", "Paint Your Wagon", "Can't Stop the Music" or "Xanadu" (among others). Now THAT would make for an interesting film!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":101,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"genre":["Documentary","Musical"],"datePublished":"2008-10-14","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0044762/","name":"Obba Babatundé","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000824/","name":"John Badham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083306/","name":"Robert S.

Sure, this is probably not gonna be a film for the ages, but it could be entertaining for ninety minutes.\n\nBut it's just horrible. Oh so horrible. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen, if I account for the fact that they did indeed use professional actors.

An unusual film, at least for its time. A stylish film full of cool dialog, cinematography, editing and music. The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creating a sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told. The pace is perfect. I wasn't bored for a second, nor did I ever really want it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent, and incredibly well-integrated. Pans, dolly trips and, lest we forget, the stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The acting is top-notch all-round. With most of the cast being name actors, this is no surprise, but they really do shine. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel, Roth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well, let's be honest, it had rather awful acting. I'm speaking, of course, of Tarantino's character. Now, don't get me wrong; in From Dusk Till Dawn, this man did great. But just about any other time I've seen him act, he just doesn't seem to have the first clue. Being a film-maker myself(albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin), I can relate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes, you just need to face up to the facts, and admit it if you can't act. Still, that is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at least two fairly big characters that seem completely and entirely expendable... they had no real role in the action and could very, very easily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won't name them here, but anyone who's seen the film will know who I'm talking about. All the characters, however, are well-written and their actions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing... something that also shows in the dialog, which, although somewhat drawn-out at times, is exceptional. Well-delivered, too. When it comes to direction, he shows how talented he is, as well. The film is very well put together. The editing is great, with the non-linear time-line telling the story far better than a "regular" film ever could. One of the many Tarantino-fans, in fact, the very person who originally talked me into watching this film, once told me that he had heard of someone editing films with such time-lines - this, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc. - so that their time-lines were perfectly linear. I'm sorry, I entirely respect their right to do such a thing... and I won't claim that their doing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way... but I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so well-told lies in the time-line. Also, I'm a firm believer of watching something the way the makers intended it. Don't edit, don't censor, don't make your own version and pass it off as anything but just that... your own version, and not the original. Sorry, rant over. Finally, I just need to comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great. Tarantino collected so many amazing 70's tunes for this film and used them great. All in all, just a really, really good film. Very little keeps this from being a perfect ten, most of which I've covered here.

It was a very good film and led to two sequels. However, the films are flawed in one way--they ignored the musicals of rival studios, such as RKO, MGM and Twentieth Century-Fox. So, for that reason alone, "Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical History" is a better film for someone wanting to learn about the history of this genre. Now I am not saying it's perfect--but it is darn good because its clips are not restricted to a single studio.\n\nSo what are the film's deficits and assets? Well, on the plus side, it not only talks about ALL the studio's musicals but it also extends to today, since it's a new film. Also, the interviews are quite nice and there are tons of clips. On the negative side, the clips were occasionally fuzzy (especially the earlier ones) and the film is NOT completely comprehensive. Many important films are omitted and you'd get the impression that Busby Berkeley did EVERY musical from the 30s (he actually did far less than most people think). But this can be forgiven, you the film was not intended as a mini-series (which it really needed for so much material). Unless you absolutely hate musicals, this film is for you and well worth seeing.\n\nBy the way, I really wished the film had talked about some of the flops of the genre--such as "Camelot", "Paint Your Wagon", "Can't Stop the Music" or "Xanadu" (among others). Now THAT would make for an interesting film!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":101,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"genre":["Documentary","Musical"],"datePublished":"2008-10-14","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0044762/","name":"Obba Babatundé"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000824/","name":"John Badham"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083306/","name":"Robert S.

It was a very good film and led to two sequels. However, the films are flawed in one way--they ignored the musicals of rival studios, such as RKO, MGM and Twentieth Century-Fox. So, for that reason alone, "Hollywood Singing and Dancing: A Musical History" is a better film for someone wanting to learn about the history of this genre. Now I am not saying it's perfect--but it is darn good because its clips are not restricted to a single studio.\n\nSo what are the film's deficits and assets? Well, on the plus side, it not only talks about ALL the studio's musicals but it also extends to today, since it's a new film. Also, the interviews are quite nice and there are tons of clips. On the negative side, the clips were occasionally fuzzy (especially the earlier ones) and the film is NOT completely comprehensive. Many important films are omitted and you'd get the impression that Busby Berkeley did EVERY musical from the 30s (he actually did far less than most people think). But this can be forgiven, you the film was not intended as a mini-series (which it really needed for so much material). Unless you absolutely hate musicals, this film is for you and well worth seeing.\n\nBy the way, I really wished the film had talked about some of the flops of the genre--such as "Camelot", "Paint Your Wagon", "Can't Stop the Music" or "Xanadu" (among others). Now THAT would make for an interesting film!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":101,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"genre":["Documentary","Musical"],"datePublished":"2008-10-14","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0044762/","name":"Obba Babatundé","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000824/","name":"John Badham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083306/","name":"Robert S.

    <desc lang="hr">Nordijska legenda koja je inspirisala J.R.R. Tokina da napiše trilogiju "Gospodar Prstenova". U vremenu koje je istorija izbrisala iz sjecanja... poslali su nam ratnika. Ali, snage mraka ugrožavaju... Nordijska legenda koja je inspirisala J.R.R. Tokina da napiše trilogiju "Gospodar Prstenova". U vremenu koje je istorija izbrisala iz sjecanja... poslali su nam ratnika. Ali, snage mraka ugrožavaju njegovu sudbinu i prijete da unište mocno kraljevstvo. Evropa-doba tame. Kada zli kraljevi blizanci ubiju svoga oca, kralja Ksantina, mladi princ Zigfrid pokušava da se spase bjekstvom. Spasava ga dobrocudni kovac Ejvind koji spletom okolnosti stice pravo na tron. Bogovi mu šalju znak sudbine, znak koji ce ga voditi do oružja i žene koja ce biti njegova ljubav, Brunhilde, kraljice Valkir ratnika. Dužnosti su ih rastavile i oni se zapravo nikada nisu voljeli. Zigfrid dolazi u kraljevstvo Burbunda gdje zadobija poštovanje kralja Gintera i ljubav princeze Krinhilde. Ali, mocni zmaj teroriše zemlju. Zigfrid pokušava da ubije zmaja Fafnira, otme mu zlato i obogati se. Kada ovo blago dodje u ruke pravog vladara, misticni Nibelunzi i Ginterov savjetnik Hagen pokušavaju da ga otmu. U želji da se obogati Hagen koristi crnomagijske sposobnosti da zacara Zigfrida ne bi li ovaj zavolio Krinhildu i zaboravio Brunhildu. Ovo je epska filmska prica gdje dobro pokušava da sprijeci dolazak Kraljevstva Tame.</desc>

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":318968,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance.

Some have a weak excuse for a husband to emphasise their strength, many others are independent single mothers who struggle with a demanding job and raising their kids. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the genre. Nothing against strong and independent women, au contraire. I just prefer decent detective work above being sucked into the personal life of a fictional character. If I wanted to see family drama I'd go watch a sitcom. It's beyond me why the detective genre has to be muddled with sitcom-esque fluff like this. (I wouldn't buy it, but it's programmed on TV *instead* of a proper detective). I can accept a modest degree of family life. After all, Beck and Wallander have families too. However, they are primarily detectives, and every episode is about solving the case. \n\n"Candice Renoir" is more sitcom than detectives. And it's just as tacky and kitschy as the name already suggests. A fifty-something big mama, who seems to think she's Brigitte Bardot in the seventies, miraculously becomes the team leader of a small town detective team. She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes. She's supposed to portray the strong and independent older woman who can do it all, kids and playing the boss- detective, but it's way to contrived to be the least bit believable. Her character, the rainbow team, the younger cutesy neighbour - who has stamped "love interest" in all caps across his handsome forehead - it's all a stylised light version of a concept we've seen many, many times before. And now it's here again, only worse. Yay. \n\nTo be fair, the acting of the team and other characters varies from passable to decent, but the lead actress is really milking the diva character, and as such, overacting horribly in just about every scene.\n\nIt might just about do as daytime TV, on a rainy afternoon, but that's probably me being generous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1069,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"france,female police officer,police","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092291/","name":"Cécile Bois"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501845/","name":"Raphaël Lenglet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6511436/","name":"Clara Antoons"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053077/","name":"Robin Barataud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043904/","name":"Brigitte Peskine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2784794/","name":"Solen Roy-Pagenault"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2892283161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's beyond me why the detective genre has to be muddled with sitcom-esque fluff like this. (I wouldn't buy it, but it's programmed on TV *instead* of a proper detective). I can accept a modest degree of family life. After all, Beck and Wallander have families too. However, they are primarily detectives, and every episode is about solving the case. \n\n"Candice Renoir" is more sitcom than detectives. And it's just as tacky and kitschy as the name already suggests. A fifty-something big mama, who seems to think she's Brigitte Bardot in the seventies, miraculously becomes the team leader of a small town detective team. She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes. She's supposed to portray the strong and independent older woman who can do it all, kids and playing the boss- detective, but it's way to contrived to be the least bit believable. Her character, the rainbow team, the younger cutesy neighbour - who has stamped "love interest" in all caps across his handsome forehead - it's all a stylised light version of a concept we've seen many, many times before. And now it's here again, only worse. Yay. \n\nTo be fair, the acting of the team and other characters varies from passable to decent, but the lead actress is really milking the diva character, and as such, overacting horribly in just about every scene.\n\nIt might just about do as daytime TV, on a rainy afternoon, but that's probably me being generous.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1069,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"france,female police officer,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092291/","name":"Cécile Bois","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501845/","name":"Raphaël Lenglet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6511436/","name":"Clara Antoons"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053077/","name":"Robin Barataud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043904/","name":"Brigitte Peskine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2784794/","name":"Solen Roy-Pagenault"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2892283161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I have seen a few guest characters that would work better and create good relationships and open more story lines... this character ain't one of them...I find myself forwarding her scenes to avoid the irritation her character brings...I have only found myself being irritated by one other character during the shows seasons and that is the Coast Guard Agent Borin she was terrible...so OTT at trying to be something she clearly couldn't be .... like some sort of female Gibbs character... she was really irritating both as a character and as the actress trying to play that role ... maybe a different actress would have made that work but certainly not Diane Neal...\n\nI hope the makers of the show do change this new character..I can see myself drifting away from this show if they don't...\n\nBut then maybe the other side of the coin is that the show is not putting out the same level of episodes and story lines that it used to... and my dislike of that new character is more about the overall than just the that..?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130580,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-09-23","keywords":"goth girl,babe scientist,special agent,naval criminal investigative service,police procedural","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001319/","name":"Mark Harmon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564724/","name":"David McCallum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0615266/","name":"Sean Murray"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0114905/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066107/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069074/","name":"Donald P.

Cowboys are based on a hit theater show that was seen by well over 100.000 viewers (some say even 150.000), proving that an art experiment need not necessarily be abstract, hermetic and addressed to narrow elitist circles. However, one need not see the theater show to enjoy the movie. In fact, it might be quite refreshing to see it without preconceptions. A gloomy middle-aged theater director Sasha (Sasa Anocic) returns to his home town, even gloomier industrial province, where an old friend, the local mayor (Niksa Butijer) convinces him to put on a theater show with a group of amateurs. A group of weirdoes and bizarre looking types arrives for the audition, none of them having any acting or theater experience whatsoever, and the disillusioned director ends up taking them all. From the first shots we are aware of all the fullmonthy and other underdog clichés, but instead of seeing them as a potential flaw, surprisingly they turn out to be one of the best qualities of this movie. Considering that everything has already been said in film (and music) and it is not easy to be original, especially on such slippery ground as with popular comedy, I have to point out the work of the director and scriptwriter Tomislav Mrsic, acclaimed documentarist, who has managed to use all the character, situational and dramatic clichés in such a way that the viewer doesn't feel annoyed by the fact that they have all been seen. Which is a good feeling! The movie Cowboys is an ensemble comedy, and it's all about the roles they play – even if there were only two or three great actors, it would be a success. Mrsic was lucky in that regard, mostly thanks to the fact that he used the same cast as in the theater show. There is the dumb Domagoj (the incredible Zivko Anocic), who remains a mystery until the end: is he a complete idiot, mentally challenged, or both, or is he just pretending? Then, the friendly gypsy Miodrag (played by the equally great Rakan Rushaidat); the postman Javor, an annoying wannabe actor, busy bee and mama's boy played by Hrvoje Barisic, a pleasant surprise. I can only imagine how irritable he could get if directed by such masters of annoyance like Gervais, Merchant or Larry David, but Mrsic manages to keep him likable. That is the main forte and the charm of this movie – a feel good atmosphere, light humor, discreet pathos, free of any presumptuousness. Not to mention the grand finale. Comedy is a tricky business, especially when it aims to appeal to the masses. Anybody can make some drunken friends laugh, but big audiences are tough, and critics even tougher. Mrsic and Cowboys did it, and the fact that they reached their goal without over psychologizing the characters or overdramatizing and by using a bunch of commonplace devices, makes their triumph even greater","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1053,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-10-10","keywords":"theater","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Cowboys","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4153917209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2YxNTA1ZjQtYzc1OC00NjNhLTkzOTMtNDJkMjgzNzJjZTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2YxNTA1ZjQtYzc1OC00NjNhLTkzOTMtNDJkMjgzNzJjZTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1088988/","name":"Sasa Anocic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1927205/","name":"Zivko Anocic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5888746/","name":"Matija Antolic"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2283941/","name":"Tomislav Mrsic"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0433957/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1088988/","name":"Sasa Anocic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2283941/","name":"Tomislav Mrsic"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The Devil's Double is based on the true story of Latif Yahia, an Iraqi soldier chosen by the regime to be the body-double of the dictator's infamous son Uday, with both roles played by Dominic Cooper.\n\nThe perks of the job are acceptable: enough designer clothing and willing women to make the average Premiership footballer looking like a trappist monk. However, the downsides are considerable too: torture, being shot at – and the fact that the penalty for seeking alternative employment is the death of Latif's entire family.\n\nDominic Cooper stars in Devil's Double with Ludivine Sagnier.\n\nDominic Cooper stars in Devil's Double with Ludivine Sagnier.\n\nIt is easy to see why The Devil's Double has been compared to a gangster film. All the whirring, terrifying madness of Uday's world is depicted with the brutal verve one finds in Scarface and other films of its ilk. Instigating nightclub orgies while American bombs are exploding and shooting at loyal companions in psychotic rages are all part of Uday's regular routine.\n\nThe direction, intermingling footage of Operation Desert Storm with debauchery, captures the craziness of Uday and Latif's world with a lurid style.\n\nAgain, like a great underworld film, Cooper's performance as the central villain is masterful, capturing Uday's menacing madness and chewing the scenery in between sucking breasts or shovelling cocaine up his nose. His performance as Latif is equally striking, but in a more nuanced way. We are never in doubt which one Cooper is portraying; his sickened desperate body language showing through even when Latif is Uday.\n\nYet this film is not Scarface, and Uday is not Tony Montana. Tony Montana, like most anti-heroes found in films depicting criminals, had a form of morality. It may have been a twisted, cocaine-fuelled morality but it was one none the less. Uday has no morality; worse than that, he's evil even by the standards of his father, a man who thought nothing of gassing entire ethnic groups. This gives the film a heart of darkness. Uday is possibly one of the most horrifying characters ever to grace a cinema screen, proving it at regular harrowing intervals with crimes of a scarcely believable depravity.\n\nThis leads me to the film's central flaw. Despite Cooper's performance, Latif's story never quite feels as compelling as it should be. The script at times makes a good man's forced descent into hell on Earth seem more like a mob underling's troubled conscience upon witnessing his boss go too far. One scene, which directly juxtaposes his actions in saving others from Uday's horrors, doesn't have anywhere near the emotional resonance it should. One gets a sense that in trying to show us a world in which a moral compass is more likely to be thrust into the genitals of an innocent than providing any sort of guidance, the film has lost some of its humanity along with its protagonists.\n\nDespite these flaws, though, The Devil's Double is still an excellent film. It is a brave attempt to portray a difficult and scarcely believable story. Even its failure to completely emote is understandable given the skill with which it presents its harrowing world.

The Devil's Double is based on the true story of Latif Yahia, an Iraqi soldier chosen by the regime to be the body-double of the dictator's infamous son Uday, with both roles played by Dominic Cooper.\n\nThe perks of the job are acceptable: enough designer clothing and willing women to make the average Premiership footballer looking like a trappist monk. However, the downsides are considerable too: torture, being shot at – and the fact that the penalty for seeking alternative employment is the death of Latif's entire family.\n\nDominic Cooper stars in Devil's Double with Ludivine Sagnier.\n\nDominic Cooper stars in Devil's Double with Ludivine Sagnier.\n\nIt is easy to see why The Devil's Double has been compared to a gangster film. All the whirring, terrifying madness of Uday's world is depicted with the brutal verve one finds in Scarface and other films of its ilk. Instigating nightclub orgies while American bombs are exploding and shooting at loyal companions in psychotic rages are all part of Uday's regular routine.\n\nThe direction, intermingling footage of Operation Desert Storm with debauchery, captures the craziness of Uday and Latif's world with a lurid style.\n\nAgain, like a great underworld film, Cooper's performance as the central villain is masterful, capturing Uday's menacing madness and chewing the scenery in between sucking breasts or shovelling cocaine up his nose. His performance as Latif is equally striking, but in a more nuanced way. We are never in doubt which one Cooper is portraying; his sickened desperate body language showing through even when Latif is Uday.\n\nYet this film is not Scarface, and Uday is not Tony Montana. Tony Montana, like most anti-heroes found in films depicting criminals, had a form of morality. It may have been a twisted, cocaine-fuelled morality but it was one none the less. Uday has no morality; worse than that, he's evil even by the standards of his father, a man who thought nothing of gassing entire ethnic groups. This gives the film a heart of darkness. Uday is possibly one of the most horrifying characters ever to grace a cinema screen, proving it at regular harrowing intervals with crimes of a scarcely believable depravity.\n\nThis leads me to the film's central flaw. Despite Cooper's performance, Latif's story never quite feels as compelling as it should be. The script at times makes a good man's forced descent into hell on Earth seem more like a mob underling's troubled conscience upon witnessing his boss go too far. One scene, which directly juxtaposes his actions in saving others from Uday's horrors, doesn't have anywhere near the emotional resonance it should. One gets a sense that in trying to show us a world in which a moral compass is more likely to be thrust into the genitals of an innocent than providing any sort of guidance, the film has lost some of its humanity along with its protagonists.\n\nDespite these flaws, though, The Devil's Double is still an excellent film. It is a brave attempt to portray a difficult and scarcely believable story. Even its failure to completely emote is understandable given the skill with which it presents its harrowing world. Due to this, and possibly the performance of the year from Dominic Cooper, its flaws are eminently forgivable.\n\nVerdict: ●●●● A must-watch for Cooper's performance alone, but expect to be troubled as well as thrilled throughout.\n\nRead more reviews on www.theupcoming.co.uk","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":61403,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-09-08","keywords":"debauchery,rape,psychopath,nudity,stripping","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Devil's Double","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4213939481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMzk5MTcxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA5NjcwNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMzk5MTcxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA5NjcwNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Forced to become the body double of Uday Hussein, Latif Ahmed (Cooper) bears witness to daily life under Saddam Hussein's reign, from lavish extravagances to sadistic acts of brutality.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1002641/","name":"Dominic Cooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0756203/","name":"Ludivine Sagnier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712562/","name":"Raad Rawi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848414/","name":"Lee Tamahori"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106821/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027006/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0859241/","name":"Michael Thomas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2205151/","name":"Latif Yahia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714460/","name":"Emjay Rechsteiner"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is one of the few performances I've seen where I would say someone is a lock for the Oscar. But this is not only a tour-de-force of acting.

But hey, up against most of the Hollywood fare, this one trounces them.\n\n7/10\n\nQuality: 4/10 (confusing storyline) Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 10/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11481,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-02-22","keywords":"france,paris france,police officer,turkish woman,hallucination","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000606/","name":"Jean Reno","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431332/","name":"Arly Jover","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0704474/","name":"Jocelyn Quivrin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619599/","name":"Chris Nahon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172053/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142430/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0335096/","name":"Jean-Christophe Grangé","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619599/","name":"Chris Nahon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002010/","name":"Christian Clavier"],"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If we look at their first Asterix movie we see a good story with nice actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardeu)but very lame special effect. In a fantasy story like Asterix Special Effects are really important. Well.. they did it right this time! It looks terrific. I personaly think Mission Cleopatra is the best Asterix story ever written. In the movie there's not one moment you're bored. Go and watch this! One thing! they didnt go exactly by the script which I think is a little bit pittyful. For example, In the comic Obelix breaks the nose of the Sphinx, immediatly all the little storekeepers start breaking of the nose of their miniature Sphinx. (really funny to see)..Well they didnt put it in the movie, instead they burried the nose under the Sphinx. Asterix: "They will never look for it here" (guess again). Was funny but not as good as the original. Another thing i disliked about the movie was their choice for music. It maked the film to childies. But never the less...

If we look at their first Asterix movie we see a good story with nice actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardeu)but very lame special effect. In a fantasy story like Asterix Special Effects are really important. Well.. they did it right this time! It looks terrific. I personaly think Mission Cleopatra is the best Asterix story ever written. In the movie there's not one moment you're bored. Go and watch this! One thing! they didnt go exactly by the script which I think is a little bit pittyful. For example, In the comic Obelix breaks the nose of the Sphinx, immediatly all the little storekeepers start breaking of the nose of their miniature Sphinx. (really funny to see)..Well they didnt put it in the movie, instead they burried the nose under the Sphinx. Asterix: "They will never look for it here" (guess again). Was funny but not as good as the original. Another thing i disliked about the movie was their choice for music. It maked the film to childies. But never the less... It's a must C!\n\nGrz Da Jean Holland","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50999,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2002-01-30","keywords":"architect,based on comic book,egypt,druid,cleopatra","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1979890201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2YyNTIxYzAtYzg2Yi00YzAyLThmYWEtOGQwYWJmZWU4MjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2YyNTIxYzAtYzg2Yi00YzAyLThmYWEtOGQwYWJmZWU4MjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000367/","name":"Gérard Depardieu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002010/","name":"Christian Clavier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0213354/","name":"Jamel Debbouze"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149260/","name":"Alain Chabat"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049807/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0331453/","name":"René Goscinny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0879853/","name":"Albert Uderzo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149260/","name":"Alain Chabat"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

At least, that's what 'Grace of Monaco' suggests. It's probably not quite true, but the film doesn't pretend to be historically accurate. It says so at the beginning: it's a fictional drama, based on true events. \n\nThe film shows a relatively small part of Kelly's remarkable life. After having been married for six years to Prince Rainier of Monaco, she is visited by Alfred Hitchcock who offers her the lead in his film project 'Marnie'. She wants to do it, but reviving her acting career turns out to be impossible because of a crisis in Monaco, caused by French president Charles De Gaulle's political manoeuvrings. \n\nWe see Kelly as a somewhat naive Princess, who against her will becomes involved in political power-play. When a French diplomat suggests that Europe should become a third pillar of world power, next to the Soviet Union and the US, the American-born Kelly quips that this wouldn't be necessary if Europe wouldn't have invented communism and fascism. It's one of the best one-liners in the film. \n\nThe story switches nicely from Rainier's political problems to Kelly's own personal doubts. She is not happy as a Princess, and has trouble with the rigid conventions of life at the palace. The film even suggests that her outspoken opinions help solving the problems with France in the end. This may not be historically correct, but it makes for a nice script. \n\nMuch has been said about casting Nicole Kidman. I think there are very few actresses on the globe who would have done a better job. I'm not exactly a big fan of Kidman, but in this case she shows exactly the right mix of a strong will, a fearless non-conformist attitude and a superb elegance. She fits in perfectly with the cinematography, full of warm colours and lush images. \n\nI liked the way the script works towards an apotheosis: a speech by Kelly at a high-profile philanthropic event in Monaco. The speech is truly great; either it's very good script writing, or Kelly employed a very talented speech writer. It's the highlight of the film: Kidman delivers her text in a truly heartfelt way, with the camera extremely close, so only a part of her face is visible. \n\nThe film has weak points. The dialogue sometimes feels clumsy and pompous, there are too many subplots and intrigues, and the director indulges a bit too much in the glamorous palace life. But at least this film doesn't make the mistake of cramming too much biographical information into a 100-minute movie. It's an enjoyable movie about one of the most interesting women in film history.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-05-14","keywords":"monaco,1960s,betrayal,charles de gaulle character,alfred hitchcock character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3188107801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A snapshot of a year in the life of Grace Kelly as she strived to reconcile her past and her present, a yearning for a return to the big screen with her newfound role as a mother of two, monarch of a European principality and wife to Prince Ranier III.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672422/","name":"André Penvern"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196860/","name":"Olivier Dahan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0374957/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362130/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305542/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3885069/","name":"Arash Amel"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's an enjoyable movie about one of the most interesting women in film history.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-05-14","keywords":"monaco,1960s,betrayal,charles de gaulle character,alfred hitchcock character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3188107801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A snapshot of a year in the life of Grace Kelly as she strived to reconcile her past and her present, a yearning for a return to the big screen with her newfound role as a mother of two, monarch of a European principality and wife to Prince Ranier III.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672422/","name":"André Penvern"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196860/","name":"Olivier Dahan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0374957/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362130/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305542/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3885069/","name":"Arash Amel"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Phil Morrison, the director, is clearly a new voice in the cinema to be reckoned with. His immensely satisfying "Junebug" has the power to make the viewer gets absorbed into the drama he presents to his audience. Based on a screen play by Angus MacLachlan, the film is a pleasant surprise.\n\nIf you haven't seen the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.\n\nAt the start of the film, we are taken to Madeleine's gallery in Chicago where an art auction is taking place. The lovely Madeleine is seen behind the scenes, when she suddenly happens to catch sight of George, who happens to be at the event. We are aware of Madeleine's lust for the handsome George, and as fate would have it, they get married.\n\nWhen Madeleine decides to go to visit one eccentric painter in North Carolina, a visit to George's family is in order. The contrast between the worldly Madeleine and her new in-laws is something we realize right away. The mother, Peg, is a controlling woman who presides over the big household. She is weary of strangers, as she perceives Madeleine to be. The father, Eugene, is a taciturn man who clearly wants to stay away from his wife, hiding in the basement, where he carves animal figures that we never get to see. Johnny, the other son, seems to be resentful of his brother for having left home. His wife Ashley, is the only person who seems to be happy, or at least, adjusted to her situation and surroundings.\n\nThe basic trouble with this family is that they don't communicate. Nothing is ever heard about what has made them grow apart. There is no warmth whatsoever from Peg toward anyone at all. In fact, for being this a Christian family, they exhibit no kindness toward Madeleine, who tries to connect with them, to no avail. Johnny misreads his new sister-in-law's kindness with sexuality, which is clearly not the case. It's only Ashley, the simple girl with a heart of gold who seems to be having some semblance being well adjusted in spite of the coldness of her new home.\n\nAmy Adams and Embeth Davidtz, who play Amy and Madeleine, respectively, give amazing portrayals of these two opposite women. Ms. Adams is one of the best things in the film because she hasn't been touched by whatever is making the rest of the family so miserable. Embeth Davidtz, one of the best young actresses working in film and in the theater these days gives a graceful account of Madeleine, a woman of a different background who is accepting and wants to be accepted by her new family.\n\nThe rest of the cast is well balanced. Benjamin McKenzie is seen as the frustrated Johnny, who is clearly an unhappy man living with his family. Alessandro Nivola has a great moment when he is asked to sing a hymn at a church gathering. Celia Weston makes Peg, into a mystery, as we can't conceive her reaction toward the woman who married George and can't accept her. Scott Wilson is the father.\n\n"Junebug" is a film that will stay with the viewer for quite a long time after it's finished. Mr. Morrison makes us get involved in the situation he is presenting for us. Clearly, not a film for the great masses, but it will gratify fans of this type of indie that shows a director who clearly has things under control and is not afraid to get the viewer involved in the story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22642,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-09-16","keywords":"incommunicability,favorite child,dysfunctional family,mother son relationship,soda","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Junebug","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2173894937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjdkYTMxMGQtYmJjZC00Y2M1LThjNmYtMzIyNzdhYTI4MzRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjdkYTMxMGQtYmJjZC00Y2M1LThjNmYtMzIyNzdhYTI4MzRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001110/","name":"Embeth Davidtz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005273/","name":"Alessandro Nivola"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9165472/","name":"David Kuhn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0607275/","name":"Phil Morrison"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0307988/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0130058/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533666/","name":"Angus MacLachlan"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"Jokes" that simply don't work or are tired ("jailbroken" iPhones in 2019?), coupled with wooden acting. However, I don't think the actors are to blame a lot given the weak script and plot they had to work with.\n\n\n\n* The special effects are not much better than in the first movie, where did the budget (around 3X the amount of the first movie, 20+ million versus 7-8 million Euro!) end up? For example, the director asked for extra crowdfunding money for some additional "Vril" kill scenes that add next to nothing in the final version.\n\n\n\n* Weak communication with funders, credibility is broken or lost. "Normal" moviegoers get to see the sequel weeks or months in advance - and since the movie leaked out to the usual Internet sites, there was and is no sound logic in NOT providing a digital copy (or at least a stream) to backers who funded this in good faith many years ago.\n\n\n(The movie ended up in development hell because of legal troubles with the FX team from the first movie concerning intellectual property, I will spare you the boring details. This results in more of the jokes and puns that COULD have worked a few years ago now being outdated as of 2019.).\n\nRecommendation for a third Iron Sky movie (which is at least hinted at when the credits roll): Get a better scriptwriter, get a better scriptwriter. Did I mention to get a better scriptwriter? And maybe a new director as well.\n\nUpdate: It looks like the production company behind IS went bankrupt (no wonder given the box office flop), therefore a third movie to end the trilogy on Mars looks very unlikely at the moment.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9746,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5},"genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-01-16","keywords":"reference to adolf hitler,gay character,moon,muscleman,german","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2720119833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2Nzk5MTAtYTFiZS00MjczLWEyYTUtYWJiZDM5MDdlNWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2Nzk5MTAtYTFiZS00MjczLWEyYTUtYWJiZDM5MDdlNWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Following the devastating aftermath of nuclear war on Earth, a former Nazi Moonbase has become the last refuge for mankind.

"Jokes" that simply don't work or are tired ("jailbroken" iPhones in 2019?), coupled with wooden acting. However, I don't think the actors are to blame a lot given the weak script and plot they had to work with.\n\n\n\n* The special effects are not much better than in the first movie, where did the budget (around 3X the amount of the first movie, 20+ million versus 7-8 million Euro!) end up? For example, the director asked for extra crowdfunding money for some additional "Vril" kill scenes that add next to nothing in the final version.\n\n\n\n* Weak communication with funders, credibility is broken or lost. "Normal" moviegoers get to see the sequel weeks or months in advance - and since the movie leaked out to the usual Internet sites, there was and is no sound logic in NOT providing a digital copy (or at least a stream) to backers who funded this in good faith many years ago.\n\n\n(The movie ended up in development hell because of legal troubles with the FX team from the first movie concerning intellectual property, I will spare you the boring details. This results in more of the jokes and puns that COULD have worked a few years ago now being outdated as of 2019.).\n\nRecommendation for a third Iron Sky movie (which is at least hinted at when the credits roll): Get a better scriptwriter, get a better scriptwriter. Did I mention to get a better scriptwriter? And maybe a new director as well.\n\nUpdate: It looks like the production company behind IS went bankrupt (no wonder given the box office flop), therefore a third movie to end the trilogy on Mars looks very unlikely at the moment.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9746,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-01-16","keywords":"reference to adolf hitler,gay character,moon,muscleman,german","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2720119833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2Nzk5MTAtYTFiZS00MjczLWEyYTUtYWJiZDM5MDdlNWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2Nzk5MTAtYTFiZS00MjczLWEyYTUtYWJiZDM5MDdlNWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Following the devastating aftermath of nuclear war on Earth, a former Nazi Moonbase has become the last refuge for mankind.

He's not so successful in his professional as well as personal life. He has quite a relationship with cats. Doesn't have enough money to sustain his daily days. Doesn't have a home and is a wanderer. The people he loves despises him and he despises other people. The film shows you the ups &amp; downs or more like downs &amp; downs of llewyn's life. Towards the end of the film the character's depression was quite visible. The story progression of the film is really interesting. The cinematography is quite basic and yet pretty. The tonality &amp; ambience of the film is very unique, very soft, dreamy &amp; quite soluble. You'll doubt whether you're sleepy or it is the film which is like that. Oscar Isaac played Llewyn very well. An underappreciated &amp; great musical film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":146701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2013-11-06","keywords":"false promise of the american dream,folk singer,new york city,musician,couchsurfing","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1645979673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2MzM0NDQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEyNTkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2MzM0NDQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEyNTkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A week in the life of a young singer as he navigates the Greenwich Village folk scene of 1961.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659547/","name":"Carey Mulligan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000422/","name":"John Goodman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047306/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0413801/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The answer is yes but 'The Fighter' still manages to maintain a unique quality. First of all, the four principle characters: Micky, Dicky, Charlene and Alice are unlike anyone one has seen in this kind of film.\n\nThey are wonderfully defined and the actors who portray them are cast against type and turn in their finest performance. Both Melissa Leo and Amy Adams are like you've never seen them before and they appear very natural on screen. Mark Wahlberg is superly restrained and Christian Bale does one of his best works of his entire career. They are supported by a host of impressive actors.\n\nIn addition to the marvelous performances, the makeup department has done a remarkable job, especially by making Leo look old enough to play Bale and Wahlberg's mother. Bale actually does look years older than Wahlberg (when in reality he's a year younger) and that just adds more to the authenticity.\n\nFrom the opening sequence, I was under the impression that 'The Fighter' was going to be a documentary-type movie but O.

His execution is subtle unlike the loud approach which other directors commonly follow.\n\nFor me 'The Fighter', is more about the human connection than the sports itself. Boxing is clearly a metaphor as is the title which has multiple meanings. Even though he's been constantly let down by his family, Micky chose to give them a second chance and have them by his side. Even though Charlene disapproves Alice and Dicky's involvement in Micky's career, Dicky attempts to persuade her because he knows that Micky won't stand a chance without her by his side. Even though Alice and Charlene don't see eye to eye, there's a silent acceptance between them as they know that Micky needs them both.\n\nI am really beginning to have more respect for Mark Wahlberg for producing gems like this (in addition to some amazing TV-series like 'In Treatment', 'Boardwalk Empire' and 'Entourage') and his growth as an actor is obviously apparent (he just needs to avoid tripe like 'The Happening' at all costs).\n\n'The Fighter' is a winner on various levels."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":352164,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2010-12-17","keywords":"boxing,boxer,scantily clad female,panties,nipples visible through clothing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Fighter: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2330986777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk5ODc4ODk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA2NDk4Mw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk5ODc4ODk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA2NDk4Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A look at the early years of boxer "Irish" Micky Ward and his brother who helped train him before going pro in the mid 1980s."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0010736/","name":"Amy Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751102/","name":"David O.

Go ahead and call it "Aaron Brockovich." But director Todd Haynes still makes it entirely engaging and painfully true that death is a number compared to liability and that is how you can sustain cold hearted industry. Made more gut wrenching is how they believed the ends justified the means. Mark Ruffalo tackles the lawyer with the conscience wonderfully. Suffering under the weight of what he must do and what then envelops his small world. It's heroic in how much he does sacrifice and let's face it, these stories don't end well. What director Haynes does is put a face to the not-on-the-books crime. And though, it only is a civil case somehow you sense the frustration of the town. Not played as rubes but believing that a massive corporation who funded and gave perks to sustain the village wouldn't willingly destroy it. As we know now versus 1998, they knew...if not for simple morbid curiosity. Then sat on the information as it fed the machine decades later, we are now more informed and much more paranoid. Everything we eat or touch or...breathe we are closer to death. I was in that area in 1998...and the news then spent less time on it then I recall. As a college bound student, I heard murmurs of DuPont and jokes were made of this. Now...it seems bitterly grim. How many lives were destroyed because of shady dealings. When you peel the onion, you do weep. I love this flick. The flavor of that era is pitch perfect. The backroads of an industrial town, built under poor chemistry just sweats disease. And you walk out angered by it. The fight continues to this day.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2019-12-06","keywords":"environmental pollution,water pollution,lawyer as protagonist,chemical pollution,chemical contamination","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3717512985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTM3ZDdmMGMtN2I4ZC00NDFiLTlkNWUtY2YxM2MzNjU0NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTM3ZDdmMGMtN2I4ZC00NDFiLTlkNWUtY2YxM2MzNjU0NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the true story of Robert Bilott, an attorney who took on the DuPont company in an environmental suit exposing a decades-long history of chemical pollution in drinking water."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749263/","name":"Mark Ruffalo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000209/","name":"Tim Robbins"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001331/","name":"Todd Haynes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0783031/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0484360/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10164264/","name":"Nathaniel Rich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3918350/","name":"Mario Correa"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1996352/","name":"Matthew Michael Carnahan"}],"duration":"PT2H6M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Go ahead and call it "Aaron Brockovich." But director Todd Haynes still makes it entirely engaging and painfully true that death is a number compared to liability and that is how you can sustain cold hearted industry. Made more gut wrenching is how they believed the ends justified the means. Mark Ruffalo tackles the lawyer with the conscience wonderfully. Suffering under the weight of what he must do and what then envelops his small world. It's heroic in how much he does sacrifice and let's face it, these stories don't end well. What director Haynes does is put a face to the not-on-the-books crime. And though, it only is a civil case somehow you sense the frustration of the town. Not played as rubes but believing that a massive corporation who funded and gave perks to sustain the village wouldn't willingly destroy it. As we know now versus 1998, they knew...if not for simple morbid curiosity. Then sat on the information as it fed the machine decades later, we are now more informed and much more paranoid. Everything we eat or touch or...breathe we are closer to death. I was in that area in 1998...and the news then spent less time on it then I recall. As a college bound student, I heard murmurs of DuPont and jokes were made of this. Now...it seems bitterly grim. How many lives were destroyed because of shady dealings. When you peel the onion, you do weep. I love this flick. The flavor of that era is pitch perfect. The backroads of an industrial town, built under poor chemistry just sweats disease. And you walk out angered by it. The fight continues to this day.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2019-12-06","keywords":"environmental pollution,water pollution,lawyer as protagonist,chemical pollution,chemical contamination","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3717512985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTM3ZDdmMGMtN2I4ZC00NDFiLTlkNWUtY2YxM2MzNjU0NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTM3ZDdmMGMtN2I4ZC00NDFiLTlkNWUtY2YxM2MzNjU0NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the true story of Robert Bilott, an attorney who took on the DuPont company in an environmental suit exposing a decades-long history of chemical pollution in drinking water.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749263/","name":"Mark Ruffalo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000209/","name":"Tim Robbins"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001331/","name":"Todd Haynes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0783031/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0484360/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10164264/","name":"Nathaniel Rich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3918350/","name":"Mario Correa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1996352/","name":"Matthew Michael Carnahan"],"duration":"PT2H6M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Just when you thought the story line couldn't get any crazier something stupider happened and by the end it was hard to keep everything that was going on straight. It had endearing and sweet family moments that were really it's only saving grace. If you had cut out half the random story lines and the random awkward sexual parts that...for the record did not add to the plot line, it would have been a great movie but as usual a potentially good film is ruined with crude comedy. That being said some of the story lines that had been supplemented by crude comedy were amusing story lines but were sort of ruined.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48573,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-04-26","keywords":"wedding,divorce,family relationships,farce,adoption","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2079761945","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDc2Mzk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk0MzEzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDc2Mzk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk0MzEzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"To the amusement of their adult children and friends, long divorced couple Don and Ellie Griffin are once again forced to play the happy couple for the sake of their adopted son's wedding after his ultra conservative biological mother unexpectedly decides to fly halfway across the world to attend.

Jacob Lofland is great as Neckbone (Ellis's best friend) Reese Witherspoon doesn't have a ton of screen time as you may think, but her character Juniper plays a pivotal part. Reese nails the part, and is gorgeous to boot. Sam Shepard adds great support as a longtime friend to Mud, as the grumpy assassin. \n\nFinal Thoughts: Its films like this, that restore my faith in Hollywood.

A streak of "Heathers" is mixed in as well, with trenchant satirical observations of high-school life in the late '80s (story set in Oct. 1988), involving a priggish teacher, a self-help guru (Patrick Swayze!), and a put-upon fat girl at the fringes of the herd.  Finally, a whiff of "Back to the Future," in the form of a local eccentric who just may have discovered the secret of time travel, but a secret that has more to do with spirituality than technology.\n\n   A lot goes on here.  There's a meditation on the possible overlap between madness and the ability to perceive the divine.  There's a demonstration of why, in the Bible, angelic messengers (if that's what "Frank" can be taken to be) are often so terrifying that they have to start by saying "Fear not." There's an enlistment of what martial artists refer to as the "ki" (or personal energy, emanating from a person's midsection) in the type of time travel depicted here (the term "ki" is never used in the flick, but the term "path," another word for Tao or "Way," is).  Quantum physics theory about wormholes is tied to the Fortean phenomenon of things falling unexplained from the sky, in a way that's more pivotal, and therefore more interesting, than the gratuitous rain of frogs in "Magnolia."  \n\n   Time travel paradoxes and ironies enter the picture as well.  One character (no spoiler!), whose life is saved by Donnie's ultimate trip back in time, wouldn't have died in the first place if he hadn't dragged her along to the opening of the wormhole.  Another character (again, no spoiler!), whose truly terrible secret comes to light in the wake of an arson investigation, must go unexposed as a result of that same time reversal, since the arson now won't happen.  Surely that's no oversight on the part of the screenwriter; it must be an acknowledgment of the choices and trade-offs in life, as well as of a confidence that no such terrible secret can remain hidden forever.  \n\n   Somehow this pastiche works, largely on the strength of good performances.  Jake Gyllenhaal is appropriately moody and, also appropriately, not always likeable in the title role.  Drew Barrymore, who executive produced, appears as a frustrated first-year teacher.  The movie's often dreamlike atmosphere is enhanced by the cinematography, the subdued but effective special effects, and the choice of the music on the soundtrack, which includes '80's pop tunes, of course, and a haunting original song (over the end credits) titled "Mad World."\n\n   Not for all tastes, but better, stranger, and more complex than I expected."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":765525,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2001-01-19","keywords":"surrealism,mental illness,cult film,cult classic,schizophrenic","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Donnie Darko: 15th Anniversary","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1835513369","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhiOWQ2NTItOTMxMy00NTNlLWFhOWYtMjFiNzdjYjg4NjY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhiOWQ2NTItOTMxMy00NTNlLWFhOWYtMjFiNzdjYjg4NjY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Donnie Darko: 15th Anniversary"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0540441/","name":"Jena Malone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001521/","name":"Mary McDonnell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0446819/","name":"Richard Kelly"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008059/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148520/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064962/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0446819/","name":"Richard Kelly"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Kinsey: Directed by Bill Condon. With Liam Neeson, Laura Linney, Chris O'Donnell, Peter Sarsgaard. A look at the life of Alfred Kinsey, a pioneer in the area of human sexuality research, whose 1948 publication "Sexual Behavior in the Human Male" was one of the first recorded works that saw science address sexual behavior." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0362269/","name":"Kinsey","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA0MjA1MjA4MDNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQxMDQ2MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A look at the life of Alfred Kinsey, a pioneer in the area of human sexuality research, whose 1948 publication "Sexual Behavior in the Human Male" was one of the first recorded works that saw science address sexual behavior.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0362269/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"jotix100"},"dateCreated":"2004-11-28","inLanguage":"English","name":"Before Dr. Ruth and the others, there was Dr. Kinsey...","reviewBody":"Bill Condon, working with his own material has come out with a movie that serves to illustrate how the work of Dr. Kinsey awoke the American public to a better understanding of their sexuality in ways no one, up to that point, had ever dared to show. As he proved with his other film, "Gods and Monsters", Mr. Condon shows he doesn't mind tackling adult themes, so scarce in the present cinema.\n\nThe film is documentary in style, as we are shown the life of Kinsey at different times of his life. He had an unhappy childhood. His father was a tyrant who never really showed love toward him. There are moments when the young Kinsey is shown as boy scout and there is an element of homosexuality that maybe, for fear, never came to the surface, but it's there, nonetheless.\n\nDr. Kinsey's life takes a turn when he meets, Clara McMillen, who he calls "Mac". It's with her that he begins a life of discovery in the field of human sexuality that was taboo in American colleges and universities at the time. Albert Kinsey was the first one that spoke about the things that were never said in polite company, or in the classroom, up to that moment. His life was dedicated to understand what made human beings act the way they did, never being judgmental, but with a tremendous insight to interpret the data and present it in a comprehensible way.\n\nA puritanical American society reacted strongly against the findings of Dr. Kinsey. He was a man ahead of his times when he decided to gather information about the sex lives of Americans and to publish the results in a best selling book.\n\nAs Dr. Kinsey, Liam Neeson, showing an uncanny resemblance to the man, himself, does a wonderful job. He shows a complicated character who was not easily understood by his associates and students. As "Mac", his wife, Laura Linney with a dark wig, gives an articulate performance of Mrs. Kinsey. Both actors are wonderful together, as they have already shown in the New York stage. \n\nPeter Sargaard, as Clyde, Dr. Kinsey's first assistant, shows he is an actor that will amaze from picture to picture. This actor has the ability to get under each of his character's skins to make them real, as is the case with his Clyde. Also, almost unrecognizable, Chris O'Donnell, who plays Wardell, one of the interviewers working with the doctor. Timothy Hutton is Gebhard, the other associate who was instrumental in gathering the information to help complete Dr. Kinsey's report. John Lithgow, as Kinsey Sr. has a fantastic moment with Mr. Neeson, as he agrees to be interviewed, revealing a horrible secret. It's a wonderful moment done with panache by both actors working under exceptional direction.\n\nThere is a moment toward the end of the film where we see Lynn Redgrave speaking directly to the camera. It is one of the most effective moments in the film when this woman tells Dr. Kinsey about her life as a lesbian.\n\nMr. Condon's film clarifies a lot about the genius of Kinsey and his contribution to society.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48493,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-01-07","keywords":"sexuality,character name as title,surname as title,lgbt plus,sex","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Kinsey","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2224292121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001473/","name":"Laura Linney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000563/","name":"Chris O'Donnell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102795/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0107069/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Nakon što se čovječanstvo samo dovelo na rub izumiranja, jedan gorljivi preživjeli usamljenik probija se kanadskim bespućem u potrazi za znanjem i sredstvima s ciljem preoblikovanja čovječanstva. Deset godina poslije žena podiže desetero djece iste dobi te ih priprema na žrtve koje će morati podnijeti kako bi spasili ljudsku vrstu.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Underwater: Directed by William Eubank. With Kristen Stewart, Vincent Cassel, Mamoudou Athie, T.J. Miller.

Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.\n\nAt an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors - Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Henwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.\n\nWritten by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, and directed by William Eubank, Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Alien (1979) and The Abyss (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as Leviathan (1989), Event Horizon (1997), Sphere (1998), and Sunshine (2007). I even detected a slight nod to The Descent (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic "group of isolated people getting picked off one by one". When someone as talented as Danny Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.\n\nSure, it isn't really about much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled "too deep" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And Underwater is both.\n\nKicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. Alien takes its time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the Nostromo, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, Underwater is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.\n\nAesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.\n\nElsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, Abner Marín's creature design is suitably creepy and grotesque. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was Wayne Lemmer's sound design. The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.\n\nIn terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995). There's also next to no characterisation. We learn bits and pieces about Norah and Lucien's backstories, but apart from that, the film is peopled by perfunctory cardboard cut-outs with no sense of interiority. Eubank also seems somewhat confused as to whether he's making a disaster movie or a monster movie, with certain scenes and elements suggesting one or the other. However, he never really finds a middle-ground, giving the film a slightly schizophrenic tone.\n\nAlthough Underwater never manages to rise anywhere near the heights of films such as Alien and Sunshine, it deserved better treatment than it received from Fox and Disney. Given the January release, the clichéd setup, the two-year limbo, and the bland title, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-01-10","keywords":"sea monster,lovecraftian,ocean,group of survivors,monster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1414249497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A crew of underwater researchers must scramble to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6974206/","name":"Mamoudou Athie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827931/","name":"William Eubank"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3929259/","name":"Brian Duffield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092414/","name":"Adam Cozad"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-01-10","keywords":"sea monster,lovecraftian,ocean,group of survivors,monster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1414249497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A crew of underwater researchers must scramble to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6974206/","name":"Mamoudou Athie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827931/","name":"William Eubank"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3929259/","name":"Brian Duffield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092414/","name":"Adam Cozad"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Nothing particularly original or interesting about it, but for some reason it withstands repeated viewings and still seems like fun. It's one of those movies that unintentionally became a cult flick just by being so straightforward. \n\nThe plot, the acting, the characters, the one-liners . . . everything about the production is reasonably serviceable for the era, but certainly not GOOD either. The whole thing feels sorta like a cheesy 80's sitcom doing its big 2-hour episode for sweeps week, and the network gave it some money for a real location shoot &amp; some extra cuss words.\n\nThe bicycle stuntwork in "Rad" is stellar. Yes, of course it's outdated now, and modern X-games riders like Dave Mirra can demonstrate a lot more technical skill on multi-directional spins &amp; stuff, but ultimately that's beside the point. In real life the average 13-year-old spends weeks teaching himself to do a decent bunny hop. And for that 13-year-old, it's plenty of fun watching a character in "Rad" just trying to learn an (outdated) backflip move in the schoolyard using a hockey helmet &amp; some old bed mattresses. (Think: "Jackass" but not so intentional. And it's too bad this movie was made before the era of "goof reels" during the end credits, because they probably got some real whoppers on film during this production.)\n\nI can quote every line of this movie, but I still can't put my finger on what aspect of it makes it hold up so well. It's got that same sort of odd quality that a "Duck Tales" or a "Saved by the Bell" episode has: You can't explain why on earth you're still watching &amp; enjoying it as an intelligent adult . . . but you are. (And so is everyone else you've shown it to.) Either way you'd better get your insider-status and enjoy this movie now.

    <title lang="hr">Lizina priča</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Historia Lizy: Directed by Alexander Zhovna. With Mykola Perestiuk, Dasha Tvoronovich. The world today is an uncomfortable place, cynic surroundings. Besides two of our characters are people suffering from Down syndrome, known as sunny kids. However, is this world sunny enough for them? Therefore, they got unique opportunity to get into the world of old black and white cinema with help of unusual screen in the magic cinema theatre. Existing in the world of favorite films they are forgetting about horrible reality.

Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.\n\nAt an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors - Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Henwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.\n\nWritten by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, and directed by William Eubank, Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Alien (1979) and The Abyss (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as Leviathan (1989), Event Horizon (1997), Sphere (1998), and Sunshine (2007). I even detected a slight nod to The Descent (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic "group of isolated people getting picked off one by one". When someone as talented as Danny Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.\n\nSure, it isn't really about much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled "too deep" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And Underwater is both.\n\nKicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. Alien takes its time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the Nostromo, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, Underwater is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.\n\nAesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.\n\nElsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, Abner Marín's creature design is suitably creepy and grotesque. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was Wayne Lemmer's sound design. The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.\n\nIn terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995). There's also next to no characterisation. We learn bits and pieces about Norah and Lucien's backstories, but apart from that, the film is peopled by perfunctory cardboard cut-outs with no sense of interiority. Eubank also seems somewhat confused as to whether he's making a disaster movie or a monster movie, with certain scenes and elements suggesting one or the other. However, he never really finds a middle-ground, giving the film a slightly schizophrenic tone.\n\nAlthough Underwater never manages to rise anywhere near the heights of films such as Alien and Sunshine, it deserved better treatment than it received from Fox and Disney. Given the January release, the clichéd setup, the two-year limbo, and the bland title, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-01-10","keywords":"sea monster,lovecraftian,ocean,group of survivors,monster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1414249497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A crew of underwater researchers must scramble to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6974206/","name":"Mamoudou Athie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827931/","name":"William Eubank"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3929259/","name":"Brian Duffield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092414/","name":"Adam Cozad"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases.

"It's not a ghost story. It's a story with ghosts." Leave it to writer/director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, 2006) to make this distinction. The line is spoken by our lead character Edith, who is striving to write like her literary idol, Mary Shelley. She is explaining her most recent writing effort to a publisher, but the line also represents the movie we are watching   ghosts appear (some grisly ones at that), but they certainly aren't the focus.\n\nThe story begins around the turn of the 20th century as young Edith has just experienced her first family tragedy, the passing of her mother. She grows into an independent young woman (played by Mia Wasikowska) being raised by her successful self-made-man father Curtis Cushing (played by Jim Beaver, "Justified"). Tip of the cap to del Toro for his tip of the cap to the horror film great Peter Cushing. Edith has remained steadfast in her independence despite the advances of her lifelong friend, the handsome Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam, "Sons of Anarchy"). Things change when a mysterious stranger sweeps into town. Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) seeks investors for his "clay harvester", a machine he designed to automate what now takes many men and much hard labor. The elder Cushing senses something is "off" about Sharpe and his sister and traveling companion, Lady Lucille (Jessica Chastain), but the strong-minded Edith soon finds herself waltzing and blushing with Sir Thomas.\n\nIt would be pretty easy to recap the balance of the story, but that is actually the film's weakness. It plays like a re-imagined script from one of those old 1940's or 50's movies that I watched on Friday nights as a kid. In other words, it's not very frightening and the viewer's enjoyment is totally based on the atmosphere. Fortunately, that's where del Toro and his team excel. The set design (Tom Sanders) and costumes (Kate Hawley) are truly spectacular and among the best ever seen, especially for a horror movie. Dilapidated Allendale Manor features a hole in its roof allowing the elements to freely enter the colossal entry foyer. The furnishings and fixtures, as well as the layout of the house are perfection as a setting. The costumes for all characters are superb, but pay special attention to the fabrics and frills of Edith and Lucille. Camera work from Cinematographer Dan Lausten ties it all together for the eerie feel.\n\nThe film is so stunning and interesting to look at that it's actually quite easy to forgive a story that has little to offer, and often   and I do mean often   relies on horror film clichés in what should be moments of difference-making. Having five such talented lead actors, who each go "all in" for their characters, help us overlook the script weakness, and it's really the look and atmosphere of the film that make it worth watching   not words I have written many times over the years. For del Toro fans, you should know that Doug Jones does play the creepy ghost that inspires Edith's first words (as narrator)   "Ghosts are real, that much I know".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139325,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"incest,ghost,gothic,loss of mother,haunted mansion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi924626969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1OTQ4ODgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjUwNTAwNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1OTQ4ODgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjUwNTAwNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the aftermath of a family tragedy, an aspiring author is torn between love for her childhood friend and the temptation of a mysterious outsider.

Perhaps a little formulaic and not particularly creative in its plot devices, but altogether an enjoyable way to while away an hour on a Friday night. In fact, I may now read the novels after all.\n\nHowever, as I haven't read them I can't really comment on the criticisms of other reviewers that the storyline was changed and that the main character suffered in her translation from print to screen. Obviously it's often difficult to leave a story unchanged because it just doesn't work in film the way it does in a book; and who knows what other (budgetary) restrictions the production was working within.\n\nThe sometimes ponderous camera work and precise, deliberate acting reminded me pleasantly of the Poirot series- although Phryne Fisher is rather racier than the little Belgian. I enjoyed the recreation of late-20s Melbourne, including the bright, interesting wardrobe of the leading lady. I got a little annoyed in some of the middle episodes that the storyline concerning Phryne's sister appeared to be dropped as it was the most intriguing thing about the early episodes, but I was satisfied by the end of the series. I also liked the development of the friendship between Phryne and Jack Robinson, and Hugh &amp; Dot were quite cute too.\n\nDon't sit down to this expecting something mind-altering or deeply intellectual. This is quality b-grade and proud of it; it does its thing very well indeed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14820,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-02-24","keywords":"liberated woman,australia,female protagonist,headstrong woman,detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204583/","name":"Essie Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656289/","name":"Nathan Page","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3793639/","name":"Hugo Johnstone-Burt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346452/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3789075225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

From our first introduction to Ross, he shows his character and it is impossible not to care about him the way he cares about those in his life.

Perhaps a little formulaic and not particularly creative in its plot devices, but altogether an enjoyable way to while away an hour on a Friday night. In fact, I may now read the novels after all.\n\nHowever, as I haven't read them I can't really comment on the criticisms of other reviewers that the storyline was changed and that the main character suffered in her translation from print to screen. Obviously it's often difficult to leave a story unchanged because it just doesn't work in film the way it does in a book; and who knows what other (budgetary) restrictions the production was working within.\n\nThe sometimes ponderous camera work and precise, deliberate acting reminded me pleasantly of the Poirot series- although Phryne Fisher is rather racier than the little Belgian. I enjoyed the recreation of late-20s Melbourne, including the bright, interesting wardrobe of the leading lady. I got a little annoyed in some of the middle episodes that the storyline concerning Phryne's sister appeared to be dropped as it was the most intriguing thing about the early episodes, but I was satisfied by the end of the series. I also liked the development of the friendship between Phryne and Jack Robinson, and Hugh &amp; Dot were quite cute too.\n\nDon't sit down to this expecting something mind-altering or deeply intellectual. This is quality b-grade and proud of it; it does its thing very well indeed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14820,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-02-24","keywords":"liberated woman,australia,female protagonist,headstrong woman,detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204583/","name":"Essie Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656289/","name":"Nathan Page","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3793639/","name":"Hugo Johnstone-Burt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346452/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3789075225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Unfortunately, Frankie ain't no Phryne. The main character lacks the drive and personality one would expect from a female detective in an 1920s male dominated environment. Indeed, aside from very soft references to prohibition and slavery (in that order) the series appears to ignore the social references and culture of the times, and the aforementioned 1920s female detective appears to glide through unencumbered, except for the very soft and predictable love interest from the local news hack. Hardly believable, and only suitable for a kid's series. It's a shame, the period locations, sets and costumes were enjoyable, and the supporting cast was OK. But if the script and the main character are not up to scratch, then you can only produce a mediocre piece. CBC wasted their money on this one. Don't waste your time.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2163,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2017-11-06","keywords":"toronto canada,investigation,mother daughter relationship,female partner,crime solving","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0809049/","name":"Lauren Lee Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6698172/","name":"Chantel Riley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4428734/","name":"Rebecca Liddiard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330410/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086650/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370474/","name":"Carol Hay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3687965/","name":"Michelle Ricci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Frankie Drake: Season 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3482828569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk5NjFmYjUtMzljMy00Y2JiLTk4OGMtNDQ3ZTg2MzUxZjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk5NjFmYjUtMzljMy00Y2JiLTk4OGMtNDQ3ZTg2MzUxZjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I do not listen to opera or classical music but yearn to know what the wonderful soundtrack comprises of. The characters and relationship of Morse and Thursday is captivating. This is British TV drama at its very best. I just hope it is kept real and Oxford does not become more infamous than 'Denton Woods'!

As you probably know the Manhattan Project was a research and development project for the first Atomic Bomb, thus the name of the show Manh(A)ttan with the middle A stylized as separated.\n\nThe series follows the lives of the families living in a strict, military controlled, village in the middle of the desert. In that place paranoia rules. Because of the big secret (the development of the "gadget" as they call it) everyone is considered a possible leak or a suspect for espionage. Their correspondence to the outside world is controlled, the army makes random checks to them and their belongings, they even have to take polygraph tests if they seem more suspicious than others.\n\nThe production has nothing to envy from a feature film. Attention to detail. Countless extras and above all a remarkable cinematography. The way they make you feel the "space", the atmosphere of this place is extraordinary. \n\nI hope it will continue in the same fashion and not consume itself in many subplots and little dramas that will make it tiresome. (If it does, it wouldn't be the first time a great pilot is followed by mediocre episodes). But for now...\n\n***Highly recommended.\n\nUPDATE after having seen 9 episodes\n\nUnfortunately my fears have been realized. The show is full of pointless subplots and is now boring and far from entertaining.\n\nOppenheimer's screen time is measured in ...seconds in the 10 hours I wasted to watch this.\n\nThe race for the atomic bomb and WW2 is almost absent.\n\nIt's all about the lives and the little dramas of the wives, the mistresses and the ..$2 prostitutes who live in the camp. Who gets high with what, who is screwing whom etc.\n\nMaybe they should change the title to MANHATTAN HOUSEWIVES.\n\n***Overall: Avoid it. I'm changing my rating from 8 to a (very generous) 4.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8180,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2014-07-27","keywords":"1940s,year 1944,year 1943,manhattan project,los alamos new mexico","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3014031/","name":"Rachel Brosnahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985974/","name":"Michael Chernus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706832/","name":"Christopher Denham"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126698/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0562101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2212280/","name":"Sam Shaw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1935127321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A well performed, touching and interesting show caught my eye. The characters are involving, are worth caring about and have a strong sense of purpose. Each one brings something to the mix and adds their own skills to the events of each episode. Each episode has a strong mystery to be solved, sometimes offering an intriguing moral dilemma to both Murdoch and the viewer. It is also very reassuring to not have modern day morality thrust into the past as happens so frequently with other shows (yes 'Dr Quinn Medicine Woman', I mean you), dealing with the nineteenth century. Instead we are allowed to explore the world as they see it, enjoying the discoveries and trying to find a way forward into a new century. Well done to all concerned and long may it continue.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12047,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Perhaps a little formulaic and not particularly creative in its plot devices, but altogether an enjoyable way to while away an hour on a Friday night. In fact, I may now read the novels after all.\n\nHowever, as I haven't read them I can't really comment on the criticisms of other reviewers that the storyline was changed and that the main character suffered in her translation from print to screen. Obviously it's often difficult to leave a story unchanged because it just doesn't work in film the way it does in a book; and who knows what other (budgetary) restrictions the production was working within.\n\nThe sometimes ponderous camera work and precise, deliberate acting reminded me pleasantly of the Poirot series- although Phryne Fisher is rather racier than the little Belgian. I enjoyed the recreation of late-20s Melbourne, including the bright, interesting wardrobe of the leading lady. I got a little annoyed in some of the middle episodes that the storyline concerning Phryne's sister appeared to be dropped as it was the most intriguing thing about the early episodes, but I was satisfied by the end of the series. I also liked the development of the friendship between Phryne and Jack Robinson, and Hugh &amp; Dot were quite cute too.\n\nDon't sit down to this expecting something mind-altering or deeply intellectual. This is quality b-grade and proud of it; it does its thing very well indeed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14820,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-02-24","keywords":"liberated woman,australia,female protagonist,headstrong woman,detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204583/","name":"Essie Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656289/","name":"Nathan Page","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3793639/","name":"Hugo Johnstone-Burt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346452/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3789075225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Unfortunately, Frankie ain't no Phryne. The main character lacks the drive and personality one would expect from a female detective in an 1920s male dominated environment. Indeed, aside from very soft references to prohibition and slavery (in that order) the series appears to ignore the social references and culture of the times, and the aforementioned 1920s female detective appears to glide through unencumbered, except for the very soft and predictable love interest from the local news hack. Hardly believable, and only suitable for a kid's series. It's a shame, the period locations, sets and costumes were enjoyable, and the supporting cast was OK. But if the script and the main character are not up to scratch, then you can only produce a mediocre piece. CBC wasted their money on this one. Don't waste your time.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2163,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2017-11-06","keywords":"toronto canada,investigation,mother daughter relationship,female partner,crime solving","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0809049/","name":"Lauren Lee Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6698172/","name":"Chantel Riley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4428734/","name":"Rebecca Liddiard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330410/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086650/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370474/","name":"Carol Hay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3687965/","name":"Michelle Ricci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Frankie Drake: Season 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3482828569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk5NjFmYjUtMzljMy00Y2JiLTk4OGMtNDQ3ZTg2MzUxZjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk5NjFmYjUtMzljMy00Y2JiLTk4OGMtNDQ3ZTg2MzUxZjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As you probably know the Manhattan Project was a research and development project for the first Atomic Bomb, thus the name of the show Manh(A)ttan with the middle A stylized as separated.\n\nThe series follows the lives of the families living in a strict, military controlled, village in the middle of the desert. In that place paranoia rules. Because of the big secret (the development of the "gadget" as they call it) everyone is considered a possible leak or a suspect for espionage. Their correspondence to the outside world is controlled, the army makes random checks to them and their belongings, they even have to take polygraph tests if they seem more suspicious than others.\n\nThe production has nothing to envy from a feature film. Attention to detail. Countless extras and above all a remarkable cinematography. The way they make you feel the "space", the atmosphere of this place is extraordinary. \n\nI hope it will continue in the same fashion and not consume itself in many subplots and little dramas that will make it tiresome. (If it does, it wouldn't be the first time a great pilot is followed by mediocre episodes). But for now...\n\n***Highly recommended.\n\nUPDATE after having seen 9 episodes\n\nUnfortunately my fears have been realized. The show is full of pointless subplots and is now boring and far from entertaining.\n\nOppenheimer's screen time is measured in ...seconds in the 10 hours I wasted to watch this.\n\nThe race for the atomic bomb and WW2 is almost absent.\n\nIt's all about the lives and the little dramas of the wives, the mistresses and the ..$2 prostitutes who live in the camp. Who gets high with what, who is screwing whom etc.\n\nMaybe they should change the title to MANHATTAN HOUSEWIVES.\n\n***Overall: Avoid it. I'm changing my rating from 8 to a (very generous) 4.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8180,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2014-07-27","keywords":"1940s,year 1944,year 1943,manhattan project,los alamos new mexico","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3014031/","name":"Rachel Brosnahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985974/","name":"Michael Chernus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706832/","name":"Christopher Denham"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126698/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0562101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2212280/","name":"Sam Shaw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1935127321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

She's the star but certainly not alone in delivering quite engaging, excellent characterization, and entertaining performances.\n\nThis series goes to show that today's television doesn't have to depict violence, gore, profanity, or much that older children couldn't watch. Yet, for an adult who likes Cronenberg's and Lynch's films, this clean cut show is quite interesting without being too 'vanilla'. \n\nSedgewick has really come into her character by this third season and I like it far better than "24" which has now become monotonously predictable. There's no guessing what Deputy Chief Johnson will do to protect and close one of her cases!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24258,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

She's the star but certainly not alone in delivering quite engaging, excellent characterization, and entertaining performances.\n\nThis series goes to show that today's television doesn't have to depict violence, gore, profanity, or much that older children couldn't watch. Yet, for an adult who likes Cronenberg's and Lynch's films, this clean cut show is quite interesting without being too 'vanilla'. \n\nSedgewick has really come into her character by this third season and I like it far better than "24" which has now become monotonously predictable. There's no guessing what Deputy Chief Johnson will do to protect and close one of her cases!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24258,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

She's the star but certainly not alone in delivering quite engaging, excellent characterization, and entertaining performances.\n\nThis series goes to show that today's television doesn't have to depict violence, gore, profanity, or much that older children couldn't watch. Yet, for an adult who likes Cronenberg's and Lynch's films, this clean cut show is quite interesting without being too 'vanilla'. \n\nSedgewick has really come into her character by this third season and I like it far better than "24" which has now become monotonously predictable.

Yet, for an adult who likes Cronenberg's and Lynch's films, this clean cut show is quite interesting without being too 'vanilla'. \n\nSedgewick has really come into her character by this third season and I like it far better than "24" which has now become monotonously predictable. There's no guessing what Deputy Chief Johnson will do to protect and close one of her cases!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24258,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

The overall content and dynamic are exceptional. Dr.Rosewood(M.Chestnut)would be an even better character if there are more episodes that would involve more background for other characters(Mitchie,Annalise,Etc.)would be great as well. The main thing that keeps dropping the ratings are the time slots. If you change them there will be a lot better ratings, as when it was paired with Empire.

"Dva i pol muškarca" prikazuje život dvojice braće, sina/nećaka i mnoštva žena koje ih okružuju. Točnije, Charlie Harper dobrostojeći je neženja s kućom na obali, Mercedesom u garaži i znanjem vještog ophođenja sa ženama. Ali njegov opušteni život u Malibuu ometaju njegov ukočeni i napeti brat Alan i Alanov sin Jake, koji već godinama žive kod njega. Unatoč kompleksnosti njihovih života i njihovim međusobnim napetim odnosima, Charlie i Alan jedno imaju zajedničko: obojica vole Jakea i žele mu samo najbolje. Zato uspijevaju stvoriti malu obiteljsku zajednicu u kojoj bi svatko od njih mogao postati bolji čovjek.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Nakon Charliejeve smrti, milijarder Walden useljava se u kuću na plaži s Alanom i Jakeom. Depresivan, Walden se oslanja na Alana koji će ga trenirati. "Dva i pol muškarca" prikazuje život dvojice braće, sina/nećaka i mnoštva žena koje ih okružuju. Točnije, Charlie Harper dobrostojeći je neženja s kućom na obali, Mercedesom u garaži i znanjem vještog ophođenja sa ženama. Ali njegov opušteni život u Malibuu ometaju njegov ukočeni i napeti brat Alan i Alanov sin Jake, koji već godinama žive kod njega. Unatoč kompleksnosti njihovih života i njihovim međusobnim napetim odnosima, Charlie i Alan jedno imaju zajedničko: obojica vole Jakea i žele mu samo najbolje. Zato uspijevaju stvoriti malu obiteljsku zajednicu u kojoj bi svatko od njih mogao postati bolji čovjek.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Ova serija u 12 epizoda približit će priče o Brennan, Boothu i Jeffersonian-FBI ekipi, omogućujući vjernim fanovima emisije da se oproste od ovih nezaboravnih likova. Glavni likovi ove mračno zabavne proceduralne drame su usko specijalizirana forenzična antropologinja dr. Brennan i agent FBI-a Seeley Booth. Oni surađuju u istragama ubojstava u kojima su standardne metode identifikacije tijela beskorisne.</desc>

If they made decisions like they continue to do now while they were in college, neither would have graduated or landed their jobs. The writers are letting them down by continuing to write them as the teenage girls they were rather than the women they should have become.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5556,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-01-08","keywords":"live","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2314596/","name":"Maia Mitchell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2028116/","name":"Cierra Ramirez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5264136/","name":"Zuri Adele"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0287645/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021149/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1401678/","name":"Bradley Bredeweg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425394/","name":"Joanna Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656739/","name":"Peter Paige"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 1 Promo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi153598489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzN2MzYjAtMWIxNy00MjViLWIzZmItNzMyOWUwZWM3NjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzN2MzYjAtMWIxNy00MjViLWIzZmItNzMyOWUwZWM3NjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Callie and Mariana Foster move to Los Angeles and begin their lives as young adults.

But as a weekly viewing experience: it's lighthearted, fun, charming, entertaining and it works without having to try so hard.\n\nSome characters might annoy some viewers (the southern belle character is pushed to its limits, Rachel Bilson as dizzy surgeon who has to spend 1 year as a general doctor in the middle of nowhere might work as a dizzy new yorker but not totally convince as a surgeon), but I think that the overall charm of the show makes it easy to look past this and enjoy oneself.\n\nPeople should give this show a shot and see for themselves if they enjoy it or not.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49912,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-09-26","keywords":"fish out of water,doctor,female doctor,small town,female protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1377375/","name":"Rachel Bilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454809/","name":"Jaime King","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0930317/","name":"Cress Williams"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0299663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1771570/","name":"Leila Gerstein"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hart Of Dixie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2390932761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Hart Of Dixie"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Here's some of my thoughts. There are no spoilers.\n\nFirst off, I'd say I agree with the general critical reception: 4/5 stars. To me that means it's a solid movie that delivers at the high end of its genre. JACK REACHER isn't trying to be anything revolutionary, it's more the kind of action thriller audiences haven't seen for a while.\n\nThis isn't MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE or even James Bond. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie takes his inspiration from action movies of the late 60s/early 70s like DIRTY HARRY (which has been name checked in a couple reviews already), BULLITT (for the car chase); and maybe another Don Siegel movie, CHARLEY VARRICK. The excitement here doesn't come from over the top stunts or huge explosions. Like the action movies just referenced, you thrill to watching a strongly defined protagonist outsmart, outfight and outmaneuver the bad guys.\n\nWhich brings me to the character of Jack Reacher and the casting of Tom Cruise. In the series of novels by Lee Child this movie is based on, Jack Reacher is an ex-MP detective. After a lifetime spent on military bases overseas, he lives as a drifter in the United States who adheres to a life of zero commitments: No house, no job, no car, no possessions, no family. Oh, and he stands 6'5" and weighs 250 lbs.\n\nClearly Tom Cruise doesn't match that physical description. What makes Reacher such a great character in Child's books though has far less to do with his exterior than it does with his intellect. If you've read the series as I have, it's a little strange at first. As the film played out however, I got more relaxed and more into it. This was definitely a movie about Lee Child's hero Jack Reacher, physical differences be damned.\n\nWould I have preferred an unknown actor closer to Child's description to play Reacher on screen? Yes, of course. But I could say that about virtually any character, and often do. I generally want unknowns for everything.\n\nWhich is where Cruise's casting comes in handy a bit. Because his casting sort of guarantees a certain amount of box office, it means the filmmakers can take more chances. Like crafting an action movie that's longer on character and occasional brutal violence and short on mindless action and impossible nonsense.\n\nJACK REACHER was a very satisfying action thriller for me. I felt it captured what I love about Lee Child's thrillers and Jack Reacher in particular. I'd definitely recommend it, and I'm going to see it in the theater again. That's for damn sure.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321876,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-12-26","keywords":"sniper,coma,quarry,pittsburgh pennsylvania,heads knocked together","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1158194201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NzA4NjU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4MzI2OA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NzA4NjU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4MzI2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A homicide investigator digs deeper into a case involving a trained military sniper who shot five random victims.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683253/","name":"Rosamund Pike"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0420955/","name":"Richard Jenkins"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0769768/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1676193/","name":"Lee Child"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, because of the very poor reviews and box office performance Stateside, I have tempered my expectations before I went to see it. And so should you.\n\n"The Counselor" refers to the nameless character played by Michael Fassbender. He appears to be a very successful lawyer, happily engaged to a gorgeous, church-going girl (Penelope Cruz). However, for some reason this film never really completely discloses, he still felt the need to get himself involved with a Mexican drug cartel for additional cash, peppered with colorful characters, like the wild-haired Reiner (Javier Bardem), his slinky girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) and the urban cowboy Westray (Brad Pitt). Will the Counselor get away with both the girl and cash?\n\nWhen I saw in the opening credits that the script was by Cormac McCarthy, who was responsible for "No Country for Old Men" (which I did not exactly like), I braced myself for one puzzling and boring ride.\n\nHowever, it was not exactly all boring after all. There were those pockets of incredible tension and violence involving necks which you will not soon forget. \n\nMichael Fassbender was okay as the titular Counselor, but there was nothing about his character which was fully-explored. He is obviously greedy enough to risk everything he had to get himself involved in nefarious criminal activities, but we do not see why. So we end up not caring at all about him. We actually see other characters counsel him, than him counseling others.\n\nCameron Diaz's femme fatale character Malkina was unexpectedly well- developed. She is certainly no dumb blond bimbo here. Her scenes though were the most perplexing as to where she was coming from. She has a scene on the windshield of a luxury car that was as head-scratching as it was sensually acrobatic.\n\nJavier Bardem is really very comfortable playing these cool sinister types. Penelope Cruz is too good to be true. I expected more out of their characters than what ended up in the final edit we saw, which was disappointing.\n\nI found the character of Brad Pitt the most interesting one of all. Every time Westray was on the screen, the story perks up and even the long conversations he has with the Counselor actually made sense. Too bad Pitt was only in about a third of the film or less.\n\n"The Counselor" comes across as a slick action-filled crime caper film at first glance. However as you watch it, you will realize that it was actually mostly long-winded, unrealistically philosophical conversations and monologues from the most unlikely of characters. I think the main problem is the turgid and generally lifeless script which the talents of the director nor the actors could save.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98655,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-10-25","keywords":"amsterdam netherlands,drug smuggling,binoculars,severed head,no panties","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi185837849","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNTQzOTYyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzgzNzgwMDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNTQzOTYyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzgzNzgwMDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A lawyer finds himself in over his head when he gets involved in drug trafficking.

HER is being considered by many to be one of the greatest films of 2013 and one of the best love stories in recent years. I really wish I could feel the same because while I respect what Jones was going for, for the life of me I couldn't help but feel this really wasn't any different than the countless other bad love stories out there. I really, really tried to enjoy this film more than I did but in the end I just found it to be way too predictable, pretentious and boring. I will start off with the biggest problem and that's the Samantha character, which of course is the computer system. So let me get this straight. This system is supposed to be super intelligent yet in reality she's just as stupid as any other female character in a bad romance because who with any intelligence would fall for someone like Phoenix? I mean, he's really just a depressed man with some serious mental issues. Shouldn't this intelligent system have picked up on this? There wasn't a single second of this film that I actually connected with and there certainly wasn't any emotional connection to the Samantha character. The sex scenes? Just didn't work. The weird double date? Nah, didn't work. How about the "other" woman who is brought in for the sex? None of it worked for me. Again, I respect what Jones was trying to do but in the end I thought the screenplay was rather hollow. Phoenix is one of my favorite actors and I thought he offered up another great performance. I certainly believed him as this character and he certainly made me think that someone like this could fall for a computer. Amy Adams and Rooney Mara are both good but I must say I didn't think either one had a very good role. As for Johansson, I thought she did an extremely good job with the vocal work and managed to bring some real emotion to the voice but was it really any better than some of the stuff we see in animated movies?

Think "Chocolat". Think "Amelie". Think "What dreams may come". Perhaps even, "Being John Malkovich". And this year, it's time to think big... "Big Fish", to be precise. All four of these movies have some things in common. Merely describing the premise is not nearly enough to do justice to the mood of the film. And the mood, the emotional reaction of the audience, is in many ways much more important than the actual content. Still, there's no way around it in a proper review: We meet a disillusioned young man and his father, a charming old guy who knows exactly how to tell stories to fascinate first-time listeners and children. Unfortunately, there's barely any of those left, as he retold his magical stories once too often. When his health and life are beginning to fade away, his son wants to finally learn the truth about his father. Meanwhile, we hear his life story, as he tells it... Tim Burton is probably best-known for visual eye candy movies. Few directors can compete with the imagination he's shown in movies like Batman, Nightmare before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. Outside the realm of darker, more gothic visuals, Tim Burton has so far been somewhat less prolific. Planet of the Apes was an expensive embarrassment, and Ed Wood is a decidedly acquired taste. Big Fish, then, is a new direction for him. Yes, it is eye candy, or perhaps even eye H"agen Dazs. But this time, the movie has much more of a soul than his monkeyplanet. This soul is achieved by two means: a great story (or collection of stories) and great acting. If you don't believe that the story is great, watch the audience. At key moments, everyone was chuckling or laughing, at others, I heard dozens of sniffs and tissues being unpacked around me. Yes, this is heartwarming stuff that a colder, more cynical soul would call cheese. Finally, Burton has found a story worthy of his talents again. And, better yet, he did not forget to encourage his cast to act. For a case study of such failure, see Christina Ricci's completely flat performance in Sleepy Hollow. In Big Fish, the cast is so carefully selected that failure is simply not an option. Ewan McGregor (playing the father in his youth) may not have much more to do than smile, be charming and sustain a Southern US accent, but he does it brilliantly. Much more important are the performances of Albert Finney and Jessica Lange, playing the aged father and mother, respectively. And they both deliver character performances worthy of prizes.\n\nAfter cheerleading so enthusiastically for this movie, perhaps it is time to take a step back and look at it from a more critical perspective. Yes, it managed to enchant the audience, but it did so the Hollywood way. Special effects and big budget feature heavily. This is in stark contrast to the seemingly much less organized and much more intuitional charm of Amelie. This movie is also much more comfy about its pace - it takes its time just like a good storyteller would, but perhaps leaving behind the five-second-attention-span MTV generation kids in the process. On the other hand, I am tempted to say that its biggest vice is that there just isn't enough of it. Given the episodal structure of this movie, I can almost imagine what it would have felt like as TV series, or multi-part TV movie. I am not sure whether to wish for this to happen or shudder at the thought of "Big Fish: The Animated Series" or some such atrocity. Every story told in this movie is perfect, and a series of such perfect stories would be wonderful. Yet can perfection be sustained for a large number of stories? Either way, I wonder what is going to become of Big Fish - a franchise or a single movie.

The pacing and editing in the first half of the movie were fast and smooth. John Singleton did a great job in establishing Shaft's character and the plot.  During the second half of the movie (when the action really begins), however, the movie starts to lose it's original slickness.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson is truly a great Shaft, he's probably the only actor out there (besides the great Richard Roundtree) who could pull this off, and he does an excellent job.  This time around, though, we don't really see Shaft's "Ladies' Man" side, except for a couple of innuendoes with minor characters.  Like I said, Jackson's Shaft is a little too violent (even for a desensitized, Tarantino fan like me). Christian Bale, after playing a cold,rich, psychopathic killer in "American Psycho", plays a...cold, rich, psychopathic killer.

The pacing and editing in the first half of the movie were fast and smooth. John Singleton did a great job in establishing Shaft's character and the plot.  During the second half of the movie (when the action really begins), however, the movie starts to lose it's original slickness.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson is truly a great Shaft, he's probably the only actor out there (besides the great Richard Roundtree) who could pull this off, and he does an excellent job.  This time around, though, we don't really see Shaft's "Ladies' Man" side, except for a couple of innuendoes with minor characters.  Like I said, Jackson's Shaft is a little too violent (even for a desensitized, Tarantino fan like me). Christian Bale, after playing a cold,rich, psychopathic killer in "American Psycho", plays a...cold, rich, psychopathic killer.  He's perfect in his ability to make us feel absolutely no compassion for him. It's impossible not to mention Bustah Rhymes in a small but great role as Shaft's driver/assistant.  He provides some of the comic relief, taking some strain off of Jackson.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed Isaac Hayes' Oscar-Winning theme, which plays throughout the movie.\n\nThis Shaft is a great movie for anyone who's a fan of the original, Sam Jackson, or great action movies in general.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75586,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2000-06-16","keywords":"fourth part,uncle nephew relationship,blaxploitation,based on novel,title spoken by character","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

One discrepancy against it's classification as a stoner comedy however lies in that even if you're not high yourself; even if you've never even been high in your life, there's still lots of fun to be had here as the jokes are broad enough in their design to apply to any ridiculous situation. So while the plant obviously makes a starring role here, the focus is not primarily on it, and the movie is better off as a result.\n\nSo far this year we have been treated to an unusually high dosage of stoner comedies, with Pineapple Express being a late third behind the too-dumb-for-it's-own-good Strange Wilderness and the dumb-but-fun Harold &amp; Kumar. However, despite coming in late to the game, the old expression of "saving the best 'till last" seems applicable here. Where previous instalments from this year combined the dumb with surreal through incoherent situations obviously dreamt up from people who were under the influence at the time, Pineapple Express feels silly, but not the extent where the entire feature boils down to caricature comedy. Here the writers take two characters, start them off one place and take them on an adventure not just through crime, car-chases, comical fight scenes and little personal squabbles, but through themselves. It's a combination which could have had a disastrously polarising effect, but the writers get it spot on here.\n\nMain characters Dale Denton (Seth Rogan) and Saul Silver (James Franco) may have alliterative names akin to comic book heroes, but they're certainly not of that kind. Instead, they deal with drugs; Saul is Dale's supplier, and as much as Saul would like to think of Dale as a buddy, Dale wants nothing else to do with him outside of the service he provides. However, after Dale witnesses a murder involving some drug-dealer crimelords, the two are forced to embark on a journey that will have them at odds with each other whether they like it or not. What results of this is a story of friendship, and while the unlikely premise of these guys not exactly getting along does seem a bit shifty, the chemistry between Rogan and Franco is superb enough to allow their characters plenty of growing. To be sure, this isn't a hallmark drama, there are no grandeur statements and no tears are provoked from director David Gordon Green but that's what makes it lovable; it's a story about two regular guys, who get into crazy shenanigans, smoke weed and crack some jokes. It's not enlightening per se, but it's entertaining, and down to earth.\n\nThis is where Pineapple Express begins to take the lead in front of its predecessors, as it actually attempts to tell a compelling story with an undoubtedly overblown amount of action, but with grounded drama to bear the weight of its fabrications. Through this fusion of solid characterisation with a ridiculous but conceivable action-packed plot, the film succeeds in creating an engagingly entertaining experience that doesn't just provide excitement and memorable characters, but also manages to tickle the funny bone just as frequently.\n\nComing from the three guys who last year blessed the screen with the hilarious Superbad, Pineapple Express is a riot start to finish, combining lots of blunt dialogue with slapstick and farce to great effect in ways which made the aforementioned creation as funny as it was. It has to be said that this time around, the pacing isn't quite as tight, and the script's insistence on some scenes' ability to sustain laughter is a little off, and this in turn leads to the movie's only real technical fault. In such moments, jokes will be drawn out for long stretches of time, losing momentum, yet thankfully such scenes are far and few between, and with the pace heightening the more film reaches the conclusion; the frequency sharply decreases with time. Nevertheless, if you don't mind profane dialogue, blunt jokes and plenty of passive violence used mainly for comic effect, then Pineapple Express should please any desire for laughter that you may have.\n\nAnd that's all it basically comes down to, but what else were you expecting? As a movie, Pineaple Express is an entertaining and at times sweet take on friendship based around two very down to earth characters that most people should be able to relate to in some way or another. As a duo, Rogan and Franco are extremely well matched, with the interplay between the two coming off as naturally comical and aptly delivered to the point of satisfying the movie's biggest pulling point and focus. With some great action scenes tinged with plenty of comedy, all revolving around some memorable characters portrayed by enthusiastic, suitably cast performers who end up within a plot which is admittedly hammy, but fun all the same; Pineapple Express is good for many things, but the thing that it does best is in making you laugh, and it does so with enough frequency to make this one of this year's greater comedies.\n\n\n* Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)\n"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":326487,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"stoner,falling downhill,watching tv,man tied up,handcuffed man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pineapple Express: Theatrical trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2729574681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170550/","name":"Gary Cole"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0337773/","name":"David Gordon Green"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1698571/","name":"Evan Goldberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Nicholas Nickleby: Directed by Douglas McGrath. With Stella Gonet, Andrew Havill, Henry McGrath, Hugh Mitchell.

In recent years, however, most of these have been multi-part series made for television, a medium which often seems better equipped to deal with Dickens's complexities than does the cinema. The most popular of his works in the cinema has been "A Christmas Carol", which is a novella rather than a novel, followed by "Oliver Twist" and "Great Expectations", both of which are among his shorter novels, and which are often simplified for the screen. Roman Polanski's recent "Oliver Twist", for example, omitted many of Dickens's details and sub-plots in order to concentrate on the essence of the story.\n\n"Nicholas Nickleby", by contrast, is one of Dickens's lengthier novels, so it was perhaps a brave move to adapt it for the screen. The title character is the son of an impoverished country gentleman. When his father dies heavily in debt, young Nicholas sets out for London with his mother and sister Kate, hoping that his wealthy uncle Ralph will be able to help them. Ralph, however, proves to be arrogant, cold-hearted and avaricious. He takes Kate into his home, motivated not by kindness but by the hope that he might be able to marry her off to his business associate, Sir Mulberry Hawke. He sends Nicholas to Yorkshire to work as an assistant teacher in a run-down boys' boarding school, run by a sadistic headmaster named Wackford Squeers. Nicholas is appalled not only by Squeers's ignorance but also by his neglect of and cruelty towards the boys in his care; he is eventually forced to leave the school after intervening to prevent Squeers beating a crippled boy named Smike, who will play an important role in future plot developments. After a brief interval as an actor, Nicholas returns to London to be reunited with his family.\n\nDickens's villains are generally more memorable than his heroes (and even more so than his heroines, who are often rather colourless), and that is reflected in this film. Even an actress as lovely as Anne Hathaway tends to fade into the background as the saintly Madeline, Nicholas's love-interest. Romola Garai is rather livelier as the spirited Kate, and Charlie Hunnam makes her brother an honourable and brave, if headstrong, hero. The performances that stand out, however, are from Jim Broadbent as the vicious Squeers, Juliet Stephenson as his equally unpleasant wife, Edward Fox as the dissipated lecher Sir Mulberry (who turns his attentions to Madeline when he realises that Kate is not for him) and Christopher Plummer as Ralph, outwardly calm and rational but inwardly cold and stony-hearted, a man who cares for nobody except himself and for nothing except his bank balance. It is noteworthy that Ralph's luxurious house is filled with stuffed animals and birds, presumably intended to symbolise his cruelty and sadism. The one piece of casting I didn't like was that of "Dame Edna Everage" (a creation of the Australian comedian Barry Humphries) as Mrs Crummles; the idea of a fictitious female character being played by another fictitious character, who is herself being played by a male actor, is a bizarre, almost surreal, one. The only place for a pantomime dame is in a pantomime.\n\nThere have been complaints on this board that some reviewers' favourite characters or episodes from the novel have been omitted from the film, but such simplification is inevitable if a nine hundred page novel is to be adapted into a feature film with a running time of just over two hours. What matters is that the feel of the film is authentically Dickensian, and this is achieved here, not only through the recreation, in best "heritage cinema" style, of the England of the 1840s, but also through the steadily growing sense that good will triumph over evil, that the heroes will be vindicated and that the villains will receive their just deserts. This is a very good Dickens adaptation, on a par with Polanski's film and much better than Alfonso Cuaron's eccentric "Great Expectations". 8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12190,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-06-27","keywords":"uncle nephew relationship,based on novel,alliterative title,1850s,character name as title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Nicholas Nickleby","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2007237913","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjBkNjM4NDAtMjczZS00NWUyLWJlZTAtZjdjZGQyY2IwNmFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjBkNjM4NDAtMjczZS00NWUyLWJlZTAtZjdjZGQyY2IwNmFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Nicholas Nickleby"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0402271/","name":"Charlie Hunnam"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068260/","name":"Jamie Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001626/","name":"Christopher Plummer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569790/","name":"Douglas McGrath"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037384/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098170/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002042/","name":"Charles Dickens"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569790/","name":"Douglas McGrath"}],"duration":"PT2H12M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The mesmerizingly-orchestrated meteoric-shower-like scene of the entering spacecraft, towards the end of the movie, is one of the best executed scenes of cinematic history!\n\nWhether you're a fan of science-fiction thrillers or not, whether you're a fan of 3D films or not, (to quote the lead characters from the movie) either way, it's gonna be one hell of a ride!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":793049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,despair","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When it's a glossy Hollywood production the fact that all of the above happen often isn't homage.....it's just careless and lazy.\n\nThe few traditional special effects are ridiculously cheap and poorly done, and were clearly afterthoughts tossed in after the CGI budget line item ran out. Objects are broken, tossed aside or set on fire....only to necromance back to their original state a few frames later.\n\nThe modern "Evil Dead" committed the cardinal sin of a horror film. It was utterly boring. \n\nNo one at my screening squealed, laughed or got grossed out by the added ultra violence.....we all just munched on our popcorn and let out a collective "meh" as the end credits rolled.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163303,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2013-04-17","keywords":"demon,forest,zombie,fear,nurse","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2732631577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjY4NDkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExODMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjY4NDkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExODMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Five friends head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of a Book of the Dead leads them to unwittingly summon up demons living in the nearby woods.

The subtitle The Second Part is surely a half truth considering how this narrative slapped together by the original writers Christopher Miller and Phil Lord seems tacked on in a "Oh let's take a victory lap then" sense. The new director Mike Mitchell is planted into a zero sum game as he tries to reignite the novelty of the first film while propelling a more mature plot that Miller and Lord insisted on being needlessly convoluted. This sequel comes off as a afterthought worthy to stand beside the other spinoff LEGO films, but lacks all of the magic of its predecessor.\n\nThe magic present in The LEGO Movie resides in the playful allegory of capitalism mixed with the earned nostalgia of the animation's medium. Not to mention the brilliant reveal of a child's imagination directing the entire story. These are all elements revisited the second time around, but the trick has already been explained by the magician. The world of Brickville goes through sufficient changes almost immediately once toddler-sized LEGO creations attack with unrivaled fury. The brick civilization reverts to a Mad Max world after the invincible fat-bricked organisms regularly search and destroy anything colorful or shiny.\n\nThrough some less-than-subtle live action mirage shots early in the film, its apparent that Finn (Jadon Sand) the boy mastermind in the first film is being plagued by his younger sister Bianca (Brooklynn Prince). Her entry-level LEGO creations clash with his more involved and complex structures, and the result is a sibling pair never learning to play in symbiosis. Of course this conflict is merely implied before the lazy live action finale that resolves the paper thin dispute, and wholly lacks the gusto of the first movie's twist. The jig is already up from scene one of the sequel, because we are aware of the children's narrative dictatorship, so none of the LEGO characters' sentience ever feels authentic.\n\nChris Pratt returns to voice Emmet a happy-go-lucky construction worker who retains a life of cheer in the apocalyptic wasteland. Elizabeth Banks also reprises her role as Lucy, the brawn and brains to Emmet's fumbling optimism. Lucy desperately attempts to calibrate Emmet's persona to something more appropriate to the ruined world they now live in, but he maintains the "everything is awesome" outlook that figures problematic in a much more adult environment. In a hardly tongue-in-cheek fashion, a character outright states the thesis of the movie to be "a statement on the waning affects of adolescence on imagination." This stands as the most egregious example of "meta exploitation," but several runner ups tail close behind.\n\nFalling victim to exhausting cleverness, LEGO Movie 2 doesn't know when to edit its goofs. When you merely reformat the first film's plot to fit another child builder, new additions need to elevate the otherwise regurgitated formula. These additions include ramping up the meta meter to 11 and including two more banger tracks to hopefully burrow into the viewers' minds. The main attraction song here has a hook the repeats endlessly, "This song's gonna get stuck inside your head." Oh and I mustn't forget the cameos, which come with This is the End regularity, and if you can imagine, with far less originality.\n\nI didn't waste your time by running you down a plot synopsis for good reason. The film plays with your expectations in a cheap and unearned fashion without offering any reasonable explanation upon the conclusion other than, "We just wanted to plant red herrings, because...reasons." Screenwriters will go to great (and absurd) lengths to make an unoriginal script appear more interesting. This parasitic sequel will deliver many chuckles and feels to audiences that have already surrendered to the committee-made trajectory of the LEGO universe, but I feel somber for those choosing to double feature this lackadaisical copy with its bold predecessor.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60566,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-02-07","keywords":"lego,sequel,queen,spaceship,vampire","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2788407833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It's been five years since everything was awesome and the citizens are facing a huge new threat: LEGO DUPLO invaders from outer space, wrecking everything faster than they can rebuild.

When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.\n\nA few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her "typical teenager" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His "purpose" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.\n\nMost films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to "move" its viewers as much as this movie.

When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.\n\nA few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less.

So many missed opportunities in a film about one of the most spectacular and complex battles of WWII. I can see what Nolan tried to do here, a kind of British "Thin Red Line" (there's even wind in the grass, lol, i kid you not), but he failed spectacularly. There are no memorable characters to be found here, and one wonders even if there are any actual characters at all. Not one, not one of them has any semblance of a character arc. Not one. Again, I see how Nolan tried to convey the impersonality of war and insignificance of the individual but he did it with such a heavy, clumsy hand, providing us with no counterpoint with which to drive the point home. It's basic screen writing stuff really. I'd expect such ineptitude from a first year film student but not from a supposed "master of the craft".\n\nBut anyways, this could have been forgivable if the film was more about the event itself, but it fails at that too. After watching the film, you'd be given to believe that the Battle of Dunkirk was fought by three Spitfires (100 were lost over the beeches alone), 1 German heinkel, a couple of stukas, 2 destroyers or a dozen or so boats... Oh yes and maybe a few hundred men standing quietly on a beach, doing nothing except desperately trying to look morose and dejected in a faintly passive-aggressive way. It's ridiculous. We are talking about total and absolute chaos happening there, hundreds of thousands of rifles alone discarded on the beach, not to mention guns, artillery, trucks... Burning and sinking ships of all sizes all across the horizon, parts of beaches inaccessible from rotting corpses washing up with tides. This was actually way bigger than D-Day landings in terms of men and equipment stuffed in a very small patch of land. Half a million desperate men stuffed in a small town, bombarded incessantly and under constant attack from bombers. Where did all those people defecate, what did they eat ffs? I wanted to know that, really. That at least would have given some much needed humanity to the so-called-characters Nolan keeps yanking around like so much puppets. So many missed opportunities there...\n\nIf Nolan wanted to do a tight little film about isolation and desperation of being on the loosing side of the war, he had plenty of other places and battles to choose from. Just ask around. Or if he simply had to insist on Dunkirk, then we should have seen this total chaos all around our protagonists, in the background at least - that would have served as a really powerful, so desperately needed counterpoint to the individual suffering and heroism.\n\nAnd this brings me to the final point. The movie is one tone only. A monotone repetition of sights and emotions we've seen and experienced before. No one cracks a joke. No one really breaks down. No one has an embarrassing moment. There are no ups and downs, it's just some morose faceless robots performing obvious actions leading towards a bleedingly obvious goal. One single emotional and narrative tone from the beginning to the end. The entire emotional and narrative content of the movie would have fit snugly into a 20 minute short, and that is pretty much how long it takes before you start yawning. The best thing that can be said about the movie is that individual scenes are well directed and worth experiencing. But that is the real problem here - the film is constructed as a series of impressive "experiences" rather than cohesive piece of drama (And this particular historical event is almost uniquely stuffed with dramatic opportunities. It's almost as if golden-age Hollywood writers wrote the script for the actual event.) In other words, it's a Dunkirk theme park rather than a movie. You take rides. And that's it. And even those become repetitive after a while.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":598445,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-07-19","keywords":"world war two,1940s,soldier,beach,evacuation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3402283289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","description":"Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7887725/","name":"Fionn Whitehead"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4422686/","name":"Barry Keoghan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0240550/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It certainly falls far short of other great financial movies – the Big Short, Margin Call, and Smartest Guys in the Room, to name a few. Worth watching but not likely a movie to savor, add closure, provide moral assurance, or make you feel anything. Too many moving pieces that lack grounding – the timeline has no center and the flashbacks and jumps forward are too disjoint, too many supporting characters are painted as morally ambiguous, and the many defrauded clients are nameless and faceless. \n\nAs for the some of the details, it's hard to get around Michelle Pfeiffer accent. It may be spot-on but the voice is just annoying. Add in Robert De Niro's unbalanced intonations and a discordant soundtrack and sound-editing and it is not a movie that will sit well with your ears.\n\nIt should have been done as a 3-4 part mini-series. They would have had a lot more time to not only relay the full time line and details of the case but also go into the many interesting sub-stories and tragedies. For example, the efforts of Harry Markopolos to unmask the fraud is addressed only by showing Bernie and Ruth watching 30 seconds of testimony on the TV in their condo. The questions of the hundreds of millions potentially transferred to London accounts for the benefit of Madoff relatives is not explored. The ineptitude of the SEC, FINRA and other agencies is also given short-shrift. Did you know that Shana Madoff, the chief compliance officer and niece of Bernie Madoff, married an Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Investigations and Examinations at the SEC. They met in 2003 when he was performing an examination as to whether Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme.

 --- Description: The Wizard of Lies: Directed by Barry Levinson. With Robert De Niro, Diana Henriques, Nathan Darrow, Alessandro Nivola. The fall of Bernie Madoff, whose Ponzi scheme robbed $65 billion from unsuspecting victims; the largest fraud in U.S. history." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1933667/","name":"The Wizard of Lies","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDIxOTMxNzc1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzgyOTUxMjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The fall of Bernie Madoff, whose Ponzi scheme robbed $65 billion from unsuspecting victims; the largest fraud in U.S. history.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1933667/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"admin-22725","dateCreated":"2017-05-21","inLanguage":"English","name":"The Big Short It Is Not","reviewBody":"An interesting attempt to weave a story line on the Madoff ponzi scheme but one that in the end is disjoint, incomplete, and largely unsatisfying. It certainly falls far short of other great financial movies – the Big Short, Margin Call, and Smartest Guys in the Room, to name a few. Worth watching but not likely a movie to savor, add closure, provide moral assurance, or make you feel anything. Too many moving pieces that lack grounding – the timeline has no center and the flashbacks and jumps forward are too disjoint, too many supporting characters are painted as morally ambiguous, and the many defrauded clients are nameless and faceless. \n\nAs for the some of the details, it's hard to get around Michelle Pfeiffer accent. It may be spot-on but the voice is just annoying. Add in Robert De Niro's unbalanced intonations and a discordant soundtrack and sound-editing and it is not a movie that will sit well with your ears.\n\nIt should have been done as a 3-4 part mini-series. They would have had a lot more time to not only relay the full time line and details of the case but also go into the many interesting sub-stories and tragedies. For example, the efforts of Harry Markopolos to unmask the fraud is addressed only by showing Bernie and Ruth watching 30 seconds of testimony on the TV in their condo. The questions of the hundreds of millions potentially transferred to London accounts for the benefit of Madoff relatives is not explored. The ineptitude of the SEC, FINRA and other agencies is also given short-shrift. Did you know that Shana Madoff, the chief compliance officer and niece of Bernie Madoff, married an Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Investigations and Examinations at the SEC. They met in 2003 when he was performing an examination as to whether Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme. The SEC Director of Compliance Investigations and Examinations attended their wedding in 2007. \n\nAs it is, the movie dips its toe into the $64.8B (yes $64.8 billion) fraud case and provides some insights as to who in the inner circle may or may not have been culpable– all in the course largely telling a family drama. Interesting and entertaining, yes. A good film, meh.

Director Peter Hedges' best work is "Pieces of April", a very edgy family drama/comedy that I have recommended to many. Although "Dan in Real Life" doesn't possess anywhere near the edginess of that film, it is an entertaining film with some clever moments ... though it is much more mainstream (by design).\n\nSteve Carell stars as Dan, a widower father of three daughters. Just in case you have forgotten, the movie does remind you just how wicked teenage girls can be ... even the good ones. The film centers around the annual family reunion at the parents' (Dianne Weist, John Mahoney) beautiful summer house in Rhode Island. Although the film borrows material from many large family comdrams, there are a handful of moments and lines that prevent it from being a total remix. Odd casting does help.\n\nDane Cook and Emily Blunt have supporting roles that are both very well done. Personally I find it difficult to ever really like Dane Cook, but he controls his freak pretty well here. Ms. Blunt is a budding star (see "The Devil Wears Prada") and sooner or later, Hollywood will find the right roles to showcase her talents. By far the most outside the box casting occurs with Juliette Binoche in the pivotal role of Marie. Not to give too much away, but she does give new meaning to brotherly love.\n\nCarell is fine and at least isn't falling into the one-trick pony career of Ben Stiller. He does have some range as an actor and hopefully will mix in a few dramas with the slapstick. Wouldn't call this anything close to a classic, but it is a movie families (not the youngsters) can watch together and be entertained ... nothing wrong with that.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her "typical teenager" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His "purpose" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.\n\nMost films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to "move" its viewers as much as this movie.

Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreakingly original, the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth, humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage (played by Tom Cruise) with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point, sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself. \n\nYou have to love Tom Cruise as an actor, he always gives his roles a 100 percent and he's phenomenal in Edge of Tomorrow - Physical, funny and determined. I'd say this is his best performance since Collateral. Emily Blunt is fantastically badass as the poster girl of the war, Rita Vrataski. This is her first real action film and she knocks it out of the park. Cruise and Blunt also have great chemistry together. Bill Paxton and Brandon Gleeson give great supporting performances and most of the supporting soldiers have distinct personalities even with their limited screen times. \n\nEdge of Tomorrow's world building is slick and credible. The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life. The action is really exhilarating (the cool exoskeleton suits definitely help here) and the script is very witty and inventive as it needs to be when you're dealing with time travel (or time resets if you will). Despite its action thrills Edge of Tomorrow finds plenty of room for character development both for Cruise and Blunt. The script also manages to pull off some quite funny scenes (especially in the training segment). I also have to mention James Herbert's snappy editing because it's that good. The the situations could get old really fast if it wasn't for the fast-paced editing that concisely and freshly shows the differences in each repetition Cruise goes through. The pacing is absolutely relentless and there isn't a boring moment in the film. \n\nThe tone of the film is pretty much perfect for a summer blockbuster. It's not overly morose or gloomy despite the backdrop of an alien invasion. Instead it opts for wit, fun and action thrills. I was really gripped from start to finish and I had this big grin on my face when I left the theater. I really liked the other recent blockbusters in Godzilla and X-Men: Days of Future Past but Edge of Tomorrow surpasses them both. If only every summer blockbuster was such good fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":633454,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-06-04","keywords":"time loop,alien,alien invasion,dying repeatedly,combat","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"IMAX Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3591679257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0Mjk4MTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyNjE4MTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0Mjk4MTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyNjE4MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A soldier fighting in a war with aliens finds himself caught in a time loop of his last day in the battle, though he becomes better skilled along the way.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1289434/","name":"Emily Blunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000200/","name":"Bill Paxton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510731/","name":"Doug Liman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0449458/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125336/","name":"Jez Butterworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3890871/","name":"John-Henry Butterworth"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Serija "Na tuđem kauču", koju je osmislio i u kojoj glumi komičar Pete Holmes, vraća se na HBO s trećom sezonom. Serija je nadahnuta Holmesovim osobnim iskustvima kao komičara te pruža suptilan i urnebesan pogled u današnje stanje komedije. U ovoj je sezoni Pete pun energije te više ne spava na tuđim kaučima i ponovno ulazi u svijet njujorške stand-up komedije. No iako se poboljšao, to ne znači da je glavna faca u gradu. Dok nastavlja kružiti oko komičarke i bivše cure Ali, povezuje se s Kat koja ima jedinstven pogled na svijet komedije i ne pokušava se proslaviti pričanjem viceva. Pete je svakim nastupom sve bliže uspjehu te nastavlja usklađivati vjeru i izlaske i navigirati kroz stalno mijenjajuću komičarsku scenu.</desc>

A U.S. Marshall becomes the sheriff of a remote cozy little Northwestern town of Eureka where the best minds in the US have secretly been tucked away to build futuristic inventions for the government which often go disastrously wrong." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt0796264/","name":"Eureka","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMDQ0NDY1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU1Njk3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A U.S. Marshall becomes the sheriff of a remote cozy little Northwestern town of Eureka where the best minds in the US have secretly been tucked away to build futuristic inventions for the government which often go disastrously wrong","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0796264/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"TheatronRex","dateCreated":"2006-07-20","inLanguage":"English","name":"Great humor, great premise, great cast","reviewBody":"A delightful blend of humor and sci-fi, this is the kind of original programming SciFi channel is known for. Like the Stargate series and the late, lamented FarScape, the cast features a sardonic yet pragmatic hero with a little too much baggage, along with a cast of quirky geniuses, and a nefarious plot to steal top-secret military plans (are there any other kind?). The outstanding cast, featuring the wonderful Joe Morton and the under-appreciated Maury Chaikin, manages to bring energy and panache to what could have easily become formulaic. It's good to see Debra Farantino return to sci-fi as well (raise your hand if you miss "Earth 2"). The premise offers endless variations on a theme, and the only foreseeable problems are a stereotypically heavy-handed military antagonist and a preponderance of absent-minded professor types. If the show can steer clear of overexposing these characters, or give them a twist or two, then Eureka is an excellent addition to SciFi's increasingly vivid and original programming.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50562,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-07-18","keywords":"scientist,problem solving,pacific northwest,small town,alternate reality","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272399/","name":"Colin Ferguson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0724757/","name":"Salli Richardson-Whitfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1569714/","name":"Erica Cerra"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129175/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1184676/","name":"Andrew Cosby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1958727/","name":"Jaime Paglia"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eureka: The Complete Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3793855769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU1OTgwN2UtMWNjMS00NjNiLTkyNzgtYmFjZGUyNjc5OTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU1OTgwN2UtMWNjMS00NjNiLTkyNzgtYmFjZGUyNjc5OTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Eureka: The Complete Series"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is high on adventure and comedy, and wins because of it.  The sets, scenery, special effects are all first-rate.  The film is fast-paced from beginning to end and is very suspenseful.  Stephen Sommers again shows his talent as a director for creating action-packed adventure with a high level of comedic overtones.  The cast are all very good in their roles, yet none of them seem really to be taking themselves or the film too serious.  Brendan Fraser is an affable hero, and Rachel Weisz makes a good heroine.  Good support comes from John Hannah, Kevin J. O'Connor, and the mummy, Arnold Vosloo.  Also a real treat was seeing Bernard Fox in a small role as an aging British pilot.  Don't expect the old mummy of lore in this one, but sit down and have one heck of a ride...a rollercoaster of hijinks in the sands of Egypt."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":408149,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1999-05-07","keywords":"mummy,mummy character,good versus evil,gallows,1920s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Mummy (1999) Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3743267865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRmYzcwMTktMDVmMC00Y2JmLTgxZDctN2ZlM2IzMmU3MGVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRmYzcwMTktMDVmMC00Y2JmLTgxZDctN2ZlM2IzMmU3MGVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"At an archaeological dig in the ancient city of Hamunaptra, an American serving in the French Foreign Legion accidentally awakens a mummy who begins to wreck havoc as he searches for the reincarnation of his long-lost love."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001838/","name":"Rachel Weisz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001314/","name":"John Hannah"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285126/","name":"Lloyd Fonvielle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0418883/","name":"Kevin Jarre"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is high on adventure and comedy, and wins because of it.  The sets, scenery, special effects are all first-rate.  The film is fast-paced from beginning to end and is very suspenseful.  Stephen Sommers again shows his talent as a director for creating action-packed adventure with a high level of comedic overtones.  The cast are all very good in their roles, yet none of them seem really to be taking themselves or the film too serious.  Brendan Fraser is an affable hero, and Rachel Weisz makes a good heroine.  Good support comes from John Hannah, Kevin J. O'Connor, and the mummy, Arnold Vosloo.  Also a real treat was seeing Bernard Fox in a small role as an aging British pilot.  Don't expect the old mummy of lore in this one, but sit down and have one heck of a ride...a rollercoaster of hijinks in the sands of Egypt.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":408149,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1999-05-07","keywords":"mummy,mummy character,good versus evil,gallows,1920s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Mummy (1999) Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3743267865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRmYzcwMTktMDVmMC00Y2JmLTgxZDctN2ZlM2IzMmU3MGVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRmYzcwMTktMDVmMC00Y2JmLTgxZDctN2ZlM2IzMmU3MGVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"At an archaeological dig in the ancient city of Hamunaptra, an American serving in the French Foreign Legion accidentally awakens a mummy who begins to wreck havoc as he searches for the reincarnation of his long-lost love.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001838/","name":"Rachel Weisz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001314/","name":"John Hannah"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285126/","name":"Lloyd Fonvielle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0418883/","name":"Kevin Jarre"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Like the Stargate series and the late, lamented FarScape, the cast features a sardonic yet pragmatic hero with a little too much baggage, along with a cast of quirky geniuses, and a nefarious plot to steal top-secret military plans (are there any other kind?). The outstanding cast, featuring the wonderful Joe Morton and the under-appreciated Maury Chaikin, manages to bring energy and panache to what could have easily become formulaic.

Don't expect the old mummy of lore in this one, but sit down and have one heck of a ride...a rollercoaster of hijinks in the sands of Egypt.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":408149,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1999-05-07","keywords":"mummy,mummy character,good versus evil,gallows,1920s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Mummy (1999) Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3743267865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRmYzcwMTktMDVmMC00Y2JmLTgxZDctN2ZlM2IzMmU3MGVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRmYzcwMTktMDVmMC00Y2JmLTgxZDctN2ZlM2IzMmU3MGVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"At an archaeological dig in the ancient city of Hamunaptra, an American serving in the French Foreign Legion accidentally awakens a mummy who begins to wreck havoc as he searches for the reincarnation of his long-lost love.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001838/","name":"Rachel Weisz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001314/","name":"John Hannah"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285126/","name":"Lloyd Fonvielle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0418883/","name":"Kevin Jarre"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This statement is justified because as someone who has never watched any Star Trek involving the TNG cast it does stand alone side the best 'Trek' films.\n\nStar Trek: First Contact is set six years after Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) had been rescued from the Borg and he is stilled plagued with nightmares and flashbacks. Now the Borg have started to invade the Federation and the battle is only won by the Enterprise's late intervention. However the Borg have a trick up the sleeve and travel back in time to conquer Earth. The Enterprise crew is unaffected and it is up to them to travel back to stop the Borg conquest and help the legendary Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) who achieved the first wrap flight and made contact with an alien race.\n\nLike 'Wrath of Khan' 'First Contact' was a continuation of a critically acclaimed episode, but even if you haven't seen it 'First Contact' works on its own terms and finds that sweet spot to appeal to fans and non-fans alike and matching the two tones the franchise has straddled, dark and brooding and light-hearted and funny. The film has with a dark image of Picard being assimilated into the Borg and his eye about to drilled before waking up and all the half of the film that features the Borg is the most atmospheric. The Borg are great villains, a near unstoppable hive a races that have been conquered, a collective that all linked together who work as one unit.\n\nPicard's assimilation with the Borg is both an advantage and disadvantage. Picard knows how the Borg operates and their tactics, so knows how to fight them, but he desire for revenge make Picard irrational. It's like Khan who could have been free after capturing the Enterprise in 'Wrath of Khan' but his want for revenge against Kirk is his downfall. Stewart gave a passionate speech about not sacrificing the Enterprise to the Borg.\n\nThe Borg's assimilation of the Enterprise makes for a dark and dank atmosphere compared to the more brightly lit environments of the Enterprise. It is this sector of the film where we saw the Borg Queen (Alice Krige), the voice and personification of the Borg collective. Her introduction was impressive, her human body being lowered into a cybernetic body, CGI effects that still hold up today. Most of the Borg Queen's interactions are with Data (Brent Spiner), trying to convince him to join the collective, making him more human to attractive this.\n\nThe cliché perspective of Star Trek from non-fans is that it a slow, boring franchise that only appeals to a hardcore fanbase. "First Contact" blows that perspective out of the water - it starts with a huge space battle between the Federation and the Borg as the alien hive try to invade Earth and there are sprinklings of actions scenes throughout the film. One of the best is scene when three members of the Enterprise crew having to stop the Borg from creating a satellite dish - it was a tense scene that was similar to the assassination of the Klingon Chancellor in "The Undiscovered Country".\n\nThe action on Earth where Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) help Cochran with the first warp flight is more lighter in tone. The more comedic approach combined with the time travel story, cultural clash and essentially revealing the future to Cochrane made this half of film similar to "The Voyage Home". Cochrane is hailed a hero by everyone in the Federation, a man whose action united Earth, made a scientific breakthrough and made his planet a player in galactic politics but the reality was he was a drunk, he wanted to make money and is overwhelmed by finding out what his future holds. It made the character more human as he has to accept his destiny and James Cromwell, being the professional that he is was brilliant at humanising the character as he drunkenly dances and having the deal with the weight on his shoulders.\n\n"First Contact" is a film that works for both fans and non-fans alike, having action, being able to balance a dark plot with lighter moments and working as a continuation and a standalone film, being a strong sci-fi film in its own right.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121652,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1996-11-22","keywords":"first contact,post world war three,zefram cochrane character,experimental technology,nuclear missile","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Star Trek: First Contact","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1265677337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjExMjg1ZWItYjAzNy00NTAwLWIxZTgtMTU2NjFjNzE4ZWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjExMjg1ZWItYjAzNy00NTAwLWIxZTgtMTU2NjFjNzE4ZWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000408/","name":"Jonathan Frakes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000653/","name":"Brent Spiner"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000408/","name":"Jonathan Frakes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0437457/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734472/","name":"Gene Roddenberry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075834/","name":"Rick Berman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103804/","name":"Brannon Braga"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It made the character more human as he has to accept his destiny and James Cromwell, being the professional that he is was brilliant at humanising the character as he drunkenly dances and having the deal with the weight on his shoulders.\n\n"First Contact" is a film that works for both fans and non-fans alike, having action, being able to balance a dark plot with lighter moments and working as a continuation and a standalone film, being a strong sci-fi film in its own right.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121652,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1996-11-22","keywords":"first contact,post world war three,zefram cochrane character,experimental technology,nuclear missile","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Star Trek: First Contact","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1265677337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjExMjg1ZWItYjAzNy00NTAwLWIxZTgtMTU2NjFjNzE4ZWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjExMjg1ZWItYjAzNy00NTAwLWIxZTgtMTU2NjFjNzE4ZWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000408/","name":"Jonathan Frakes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000653/","name":"Brent Spiner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000408/","name":"Jonathan Frakes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0437457/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734472/","name":"Gene Roddenberry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075834/","name":"Rick Berman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103804/","name":"Brannon Braga"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
