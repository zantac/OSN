Still a long way from being a good horror film but a step in the right direction, to say the least. Cast and crew paid attention to building up a horrifying atmosphere instead of attacking the audience with lame and violent killing scenes. That's an effort that gets my appreciation. The vicious opening sequence is professional horror  a scene that grabs you by the throat and demands your complete attention and curiosity for the rest of the movie. The high quality level is held up a little while longer but unfortunately it loses his grip during the second half. For as long as the mysterious, deserted ship is portrayed as a complete riddle, the film is fascinating, interesting and beautifully shot. As soon as a few plot-aspects are clarified, Ghost Ship turns into a mediocre and predictable thriller I'm convinced that, with a slightly more intelligent script, this could have become one of the better horror-thrillers since the new Millennium. Now, it's only regarded as a reasonable and decent effort that lacks a bit of talent. Nonetheless, the settings and decors make it worth watching. The graphic decorations aren't overused, so it remains a beautiful experience to observe at least once. Gabriel Byrne is acting far below his normal standards and yet he's still great! All the other cast-members are pretty uninspired and forgettable. I'd describe Ghost Ship as a nice waste of time.

Still a long way from being a good horror film but a step in the right direction, to say the least. Cast and crew paid attention to building up a horrifying atmosphere instead of attacking the audience with lame and violent killing scenes. That's an effort that gets my appreciation. The vicious opening sequence is professional horror  a scene that grabs you by the throat and demands your complete attention and curiosity for the rest of the movie. The high quality level is held up a little while longer but unfortunately it loses his grip during the second half. For as long as the mysterious, deserted ship is portrayed as a complete riddle, the film is fascinating, interesting and beautifully shot. As soon as a few plot-aspects are clarified, Ghost Ship turns into a mediocre and predictable thriller I'm convinced that, with a slightly more intelligent script, this could have become one of the better horror-thrillers since the new Millennium. Now, it's only regarded as a reasonable and decent effort that lacks a bit of talent. Nonetheless, the settings and decors make it worth watching. The graphic decorations aren't overused, so it remains a beautiful experience to observe at least once. Gabriel Byrne is acting far below his normal standards and yet he's still great! All the other cast-members are pretty uninspired and forgettable. I'd describe Ghost Ship as a nice waste of time. If you have the opportunity, I advise you to search for an 80's horror title called `Death Ship' a terrific piece of trash of which Ghost Ship borrowed a lot of ideas.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98070,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2003-03-26","keywords":"ghost ship,characters murdered one by one,evil spirit,death trap,reference to the bering straits","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ghost Ship","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2794390041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIzZTY4ZjgtMjMzZi00MjZlLTk4MWUtOTNhYWViZTJlNjg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIzZTY4ZjgtMjMzZi00MjZlLTk4MWUtOTNhYWViZTJlNjg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Blu-Ray trailer for this mystery about an abandoned ship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000523/","name":"Julianna Margulies","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000321/","name":"Gabriel Byrne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253035/","name":"Ron Eldard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0065284/","name":"Steve Beck"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0227121/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024939/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0360144/","name":"Mark Hanlon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688282/","name":"John Pogue"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While there have been many other "Ip Man" movies produced by other film companies, other teams and directors, Peagasus Motion Pictures have declared that these have no relations to Donnie Yen's Ip Man trilogy. The other Ip Man movies have been mediocre at best, in terms of both critical and commercial success.\n\nThe truth is the Ip Man trilogy is like the Dark Knight trilogy. While Dark Knight(2008) was so good, people were thinking how Dark Knight Rises(2012) can surpass that, and expectations were Sky-High. Similarly, our expectations of Ip Man 3 is at an all time high, due to the hugely enjoyable Ip Man(2008) and Ip Man 2(2010).\n\nWas the Dark Knight Rises a good movie? Definitely. But when expectations are high, and compared to Dark Knight(2008), people left the cinema disappointed.\n\nThis is where the difference comes in, director Wilson Yip and Producer Raymond Wong took a risk. They decided to go for a different direction with Ip Man 3, a stark contrast from Ip Man 1 and 2. Instead of Nationalist Pride, the main focus of Ip Man 3 is human emotion and melodrama. Instead of just realistic fight scenes, Yuen Woo Ping(Iron Monkey, Matrix, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) was brought in to add "beauty" and "detail" into every fight scene? So what is the result? A beautiful film in its own right, which may spark differences in opinion between people who understood the film, and people who don't.\n\nFans who are not used to Yuen Woo Ping's style will find the action weaker than Ip Man 1 and 2. But fans who look at details, and understanding of Martial Arts will enjoy Yuen's style much more than Sammo Hung, be it water droplets fading upon reaching the ground, glass causing balloon string to snap, "One-inch punch" finish, we are looking at extreme details and incredible beauty of martial arts, which have NEVER been present in Ip Man 1 and 2.\n\nDirector Wilson Yip's way of expressing his ideas in Ip Man 3 is that much deeper than previous films. Be it hinting "Be like water", or the first scene of "Butterfly"(a Chinese mythology of a returning spirit of a love one, key hint to subsequent events in the film), there are many details which ordinary viewers might overlook, but observant viewers will fall in love with the film.\n\nNow, refocusing back on Donnie Yen. Many fans will be watching Ip Man 3 simply because Donnie is back as Ip Man, and to many people... "Donnie Yen IS Ip Man", and there have been voices of boycott of other unrelated Yip Mun films starring other actors.\n\nFor fans of Donnie Yen, his performance will not disappoint you. His performance as a grounded, highly-skilled martial artist continue to impress, but its his work as a father and as a husband that will stay in our hearts forever. Ip Man is willing to give up his cigarette addiction for his family, and to give up any prestige and reputation for his son(when he was kidnapped) and his wife(to spend more time with her).\n\nDonnie's performance in his movie alone, is capable of leaving audiences in tears in the cinema. His jokes in the films are excellent, while his emotional scenes touch the hearts of every audience.\n\nTo sum it all up, Ip Man 3 is the excellent and perhaps perfect ending to the Ip Man trilogy. But one needs to use his/her heart to understand, and use their eyes to observe.. not just the fight scenes, but every emotional scene.\n\nIp Man 3 has improved dramatically from the previous 2 installments, due to the additional of love stories and humour, besides incredible action by Yuen Woo Ping.\n\nWhile many is claiming that Ip Man 3 is the best of the trilogy, I will not go so far as that. I personally felt that Ip Man 3 is definitely better than Ip Man 2, and is definitely on par with Ip Man(2008).\n\nIp Man 3 and its previous 2 installments will definitely become classics, and Ip Man 3 will be a film we still talk about for decades to come, just like the Dark Knight Trilogy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52958,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-12-24","keywords":"wing chun,hong kong,bruce lee character,ip man character,martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ip Man 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3286219289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjM3ZTA4ZDUtNTQ1NS00OWQxLTg0YzUtZDc3N2JkN2NmZjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjM3ZTA4ZDUtNTQ1NS00OWQxLTg0YzUtZDc3N2JkN2NmZjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Ip Man 3"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0947447/","name":"Donnie Yen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3237713/","name":"Lynn Xiong"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1018221/","name":"Jin Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0948159/","name":"Wilson Yip"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015592/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0560592/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323668/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5335213/","name":"Tai-lee Chan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4183613/","name":"Lai-Yin Leung"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2774833/","name":"Edmond Wong"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.\n\nWhat a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.\n\n"Crouching Tiger...", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia!") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.\n\nIn this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called "wire work" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of "Crouching Tiger...", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of "Matrix."  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...\n\nAt other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.\n\nApart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.\n\nAnd, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.\n\nChow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.\n\nThe center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the "Luke Skywalker" of the piece, if you will...though "Crouching Tiger..." has everything the "Star Wars" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.\n\nBy the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the "Full Peckinpaw," if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.\n\nThere are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!\n\nI won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.\n\nMy recommendation: Just go see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Theatre-styled motion pictures driven by dialog versus action. Get a few guys together in a room, watch them talk -- I have a soft spot for this stuff. I have ever since I can remember. Some of my favorite films are character-driven ones: "The Hustler," "The Big Kahuna," "Midnight Run," "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles." At first glance this list seems skeptical -- but basically all these films follow the same central theme: clever dialog, character interaction and evolution, and depth.\n\n"Glengarry Glen Ross" is one of the best of the genre. Scripted by David Mamet, the dialog never hits and weak patches -- it is realistic, extremely fun to listen to, and the actors all deliver flawless performances.\n\nAl Pacino finally finds the perfect role to let himself vent (as he started to do in "Scent of a Woman" the same year, and won an Oscar for -- he deserved it more for this). Pacino has some great one-liners and quips, but he never seems too broad to find believable.\n\nJack Lemmon is similarly impressive, in what he called one of his favorite films of his entire career. Lemmon abandoned his comedic roots for this drama and it paid off -- he's not only an excellent funnyman, but a great actor.\n\nKevin Spacey, Ed Harris, and Alec Baldwin fill out the rest of the cast and all do very well; especially Baldwin in a brief cameo. I've never had much consideration for Baldwin as an actor, but his five minutes' worth of screen time here reminded me that when he's good, he really IS good! Overall "Glengarry Glen Ross" is not only one of my favorite films of the genre but also a solid movie by any means. If you aren't bored by movies in which people talk instead of running around defusing bombs, you'll probably really get a kick out of this.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":101434,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1992-10-02","keywords":"dialogue driven,office,rain,all male cast,calling someone a cunt","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Glengarry Glen Ross: 10 Year Anniversary 2-Disc Edition","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1890189593","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwZDM5YTYtM2M0NS00MmQwLWI2YjYtMDE2YjgzMjdlMDE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwZDM5YTYtM2M0NS00MmQwLWI2YjYtMDE2YjgzMjdlMDE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000493/","name":"Jack Lemmon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001226/","name":"James Foley"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034013/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019488/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000519/","name":"David Mamet"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After accidentally swapping phones, McQuarry starts getting calls from women who are part of a group of people who meet purely for casual sexual encounters. During one of these, McQuarry meets a blonde woman whom he becomes close to. When he's attacked and she disappears, he discovers more going on than he realized....\n\nFrom the above plot description some people can figure out where the story is heading. I for one did. It's a sad fact that the script written by Mark Bomback holds no surprises at all. It also doesn't help that there are plot holes that aren't explained or dealt with. The direction by Marcel Langenegger is okay, but he doesn't add any tension into the movie.\n\nWhat does save the movie are the three main performances. Michelle Williams is suitably enigmatic as the girl involved, Hugh Jackman as Wyatt Bose brings charm and charisma to the part, and Ewan McGregor as Jonathan McQuarry convinces as the straight, lonely accountant seduced into the events played out.\n\nHowever the performances alone can't save the movie from being a disappointing, predictable thriller.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":38705,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-04-25","keywords":"heist,erotic thriller,scam,deception,betrayal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Deception: Theatrical trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3014787353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyODY1MTQwMzVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDY2MzA3MzMx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyODY1MTQwMzVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDY2MzA3MzMx._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for Deception, directed by Marcel Langenegger."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0931329/","name":"Michelle Williams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2251947/","name":"Marcel Langenegger"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0206497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0018020/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0241738/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093560/","name":"Mark Bomback"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After accidentally swapping phones, McQuarry starts getting calls from women who are part of a group of people who meet purely for casual sexual encounters. During one of these, McQuarry meets a blonde woman whom he becomes close to. When he's attacked and she disappears, he discovers more going on than he realized....\n\nFrom the above plot description some people can figure out where the story is heading. I for one did. It's a sad fact that the script written by Mark Bomback holds no surprises at all. It also doesn't help that there are plot holes that aren't explained or dealt with. The direction by Marcel Langenegger is okay, but he doesn't add any tension into the movie.\n\nWhat does save the movie are the three main performances. Michelle Williams is suitably enigmatic as the girl involved, Hugh Jackman as Wyatt Bose brings charm and charisma to the part, and Ewan McGregor as Jonathan McQuarry convinces as the straight, lonely accountant seduced into the events played out.\n\nHowever the performances alone can't save the movie from being a disappointing, predictable thriller.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":38705,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-04-25","keywords":"heist,erotic thriller,scam,deception,betrayal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Deception: Theatrical trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3014787353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyODY1MTQwMzVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDY2MzA3MzMx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyODY1MTQwMzVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDY2MzA3MzMx._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for Deception, directed by Marcel Langenegger.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0931329/","name":"Michelle Williams"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2251947/","name":"Marcel Langenegger"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0206497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0018020/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0241738/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093560/","name":"Mark Bomback"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Only in space. In the distant, distant future, a ship has been sent from the Earth carrying a lot of people, headed to the only Earth-like planet ever found. Sometime during the journey, things go awry. We pick up the story as an astronaut named Bower (Ben Foster) awakens from hypersleep, abruptly; he's soon followed by his commanding officer, Payton (Dennis Quaid). The rest of the crew is gone, and the only door is locked from the outside. What's happened here? Making matters more difficult is the amnesia that each man suffers from, owing to their having been in hypersleep way longer than intended.

And although the pacing is frenetic at times, the movie is really chillingly shot (by Wedigo von Schultzendorff). On the one hand, the plot flows linearly - Bower needs to get to the ship's reactor so he can reboot it and save everyone - meaning that the actors race from scene to scene, running out of time. On the other hand, they don't piece together what's happened as quickly as they might in other, lesser films; they seem to figure things out gradually, as if assembling a puzzle in their heads. Bowers and others - and there are others - discover right away, though, that they're not really alone on the ship and that their enemies are extremely strong and fast and vicious.\n\nInjected into this oh-my-goodness-what's-out-there madness is, well, madness. The movie's title is explained as being a sort of mental illness that affects astronauts from time to time, when they just plain go bonkers for seemingly no reason and kill everyone on board. Is that's what's happening here? Is Bower the crazy one? Or is it Payton? Are they, in fact, alone on the ship? Foster is excellent as the hero who remembers a little bit more of their mission as time elapses; Quaid, in turn, shows a few more layers than we're accustomed to seeing from him (he's usually more of a poor man's Harrison Ford). Both actors turn in convincing, full-throated performances that complement, rather than succumb to, the special effects and cinematic wizardry. Often, the effects are the entire show. Now, it's true that you won't see a lot of character development here, as you might in the most cerebral of sci-fi, but what works best here is the paucity of knowledge about the situation and the characters. By spinning the tale gradually, feeding the audience only a snippet at a time, director Christian Alvart dangles the mystery in front of his viewers without allowing them to settle back and solve the mystery on their own. When you're constantly kept on your toes with sudden lurches of unseen shapes and reverberating noises, you - like the befuddled characters - are concurrently kept off balance. The result is an unsettling, entertaining delight.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":147998,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2009-10-01","keywords":"spaceship,survival,future,outer space,survival horror","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pandorum: TV Spot #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi354026009","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNzk3NjQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE2NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNzk3NjQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE2NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A TV trailer for the movie Pandorum."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000598/","name":"Dennis Quaid"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004936/","name":"Ben Foster"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1544217/","name":"Cam Gigandet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0023355/","name":"Christian Alvart"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014411/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053177/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0589871/","name":"Travis Milloy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0023355/","name":"Christian Alvart"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Why?

While there have been many other "Ip Man" movies produced by other film companies, other teams and directors, Peagasus Motion Pictures have declared that these have no relations to Donnie Yen's Ip Man trilogy. The other Ip Man movies have been mediocre at best, in terms of both critical and commercial success.\n\nThe truth is the Ip Man trilogy is like the Dark Knight trilogy. While Dark Knight(2008) was so good, people were thinking how Dark Knight Rises(2012) can surpass that, and expectations were Sky-High. Similarly, our expectations of Ip Man 3 is at an all time high, due to the hugely enjoyable Ip Man(2008) and Ip Man 2(2010).\n\nWas the Dark Knight Rises a good movie? Definitely. But when expectations are high, and compared to Dark Knight(2008), people left the cinema disappointed.\n\nThis is where the difference comes in, director Wilson Yip and Producer Raymond Wong took a risk. They decided to go for a different direction with Ip Man 3, a stark contrast from Ip Man 1 and 2. Instead of Nationalist Pride, the main focus of Ip Man 3 is human emotion and melodrama. Instead of just realistic fight scenes, Yuen Woo Ping(Iron Monkey, Matrix, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) was brought in to add "beauty" and "detail" into every fight scene? So what is the result? A beautiful film in its own right, which may spark differences in opinion between people who understood the film, and people who don't.\n\nFans who are not used to Yuen Woo Ping's style will find the action weaker than Ip Man 1 and 2. But fans who look at details, and understanding of Martial Arts will enjoy Yuen's style much more than Sammo Hung, be it water droplets fading upon reaching the ground, glass causing balloon string to snap, "One-inch punch" finish, we are looking at extreme details and incredible beauty of martial arts, which have NEVER been present in Ip Man 1 and 2.\n\nDirector Wilson Yip's way of expressing his ideas in Ip Man 3 is that much deeper than previous films. Be it hinting "Be like water", or the first scene of "Butterfly"(a Chinese mythology of a returning spirit of a love one, key hint to subsequent events in the film), there are many details which ordinary viewers might overlook, but observant viewers will fall in love with the film.\n\nNow, refocusing back on Donnie Yen. Many fans will be watching Ip Man 3 simply because Donnie is back as Ip Man, and to many people... "Donnie Yen IS Ip Man", and there have been voices of boycott of other unrelated Yip Mun films starring other actors.\n\nFor fans of Donnie Yen, his performance will not disappoint you. His performance as a grounded, highly-skilled martial artist continue to impress, but its his work as a father and as a husband that will stay in our hearts forever. Ip Man is willing to give up his cigarette addiction for his family, and to give up any prestige and reputation for his son(when he was kidnapped) and his wife(to spend more time with her).\n\nDonnie's performance in his movie alone, is capable of leaving audiences in tears in the cinema. His jokes in the films are excellent, while his emotional scenes touch the hearts of every audience.\n\nTo sum it all up, Ip Man 3 is the excellent and perhaps perfect ending to the Ip Man trilogy. But one needs to use his/her heart to understand, and use their eyes to observe.. not just the fight scenes, but every emotional scene.\n\nIp Man 3 has improved dramatically from the previous 2 installments, due to the additional of love stories and humour, besides incredible action by Yuen Woo Ping.\n\nWhile many is claiming that Ip Man 3 is the best of the trilogy, I will not go so far as that. I personally felt that Ip Man 3 is definitely better than Ip Man 2, and is definitely on par with Ip Man(2008).\n\nIp Man 3 and its previous 2 installments will definitely become classics, and Ip Man 3 will be a film we still talk about for decades to come, just like the Dark Knight Trilogy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52958,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-12-24","keywords":"wing chun,hong kong,bruce lee character,ip man character,martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ip Man 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3286219289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjM3ZTA4ZDUtNTQ1NS00OWQxLTg0YzUtZDc3N2JkN2NmZjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjM3ZTA4ZDUtNTQ1NS00OWQxLTg0YzUtZDc3N2JkN2NmZjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Ip Man 3"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0947447/","name":"Donnie Yen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3237713/","name":"Lynn Xiong"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1018221/","name":"Jin Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0948159/","name":"Wilson Yip"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015592/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0560592/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323668/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5335213/","name":"Tai-lee Chan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4183613/","name":"Lai-Yin Leung"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2774833/","name":"Edmond Wong"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While there have been many other "Ip Man" movies produced by other film companies, other teams and directors, Peagasus Motion Pictures have declared that these have no relations to Donnie Yen's Ip Man trilogy. The other Ip Man movies have been mediocre at best, in terms of both critical and commercial success.\n\nThe truth is the Ip Man trilogy is like the Dark Knight trilogy. While Dark Knight(2008) was so good, people were thinking how Dark Knight Rises(2012) can surpass that, and expectations were Sky-High. Similarly, our expectations of Ip Man 3 is at an all time high, due to the hugely enjoyable Ip Man(2008) and Ip Man 2(2010).\n\nWas the Dark Knight Rises a good movie? Definitely. But when expectations are high, and compared to Dark Knight(2008), people left the cinema disappointed.\n\nThis is where the difference comes in, director Wilson Yip and Producer Raymond Wong took a risk. They decided to go for a different direction with Ip Man 3, a stark contrast from Ip Man 1 and 2. Instead of Nationalist Pride, the main focus of Ip Man 3 is human emotion and melodrama. Instead of just realistic fight scenes, Yuen Woo Ping(Iron Monkey, Matrix, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) was brought in to add "beauty" and "detail" into every fight scene? So what is the result? A beautiful film in its own right, which may spark differences in opinion between people who understood the film, and people who don't.\n\nFans who are not used to Yuen Woo Ping's style will find the action weaker than Ip Man 1 and 2. But fans who look at details, and understanding of Martial Arts will enjoy Yuen's style much more than Sammo Hung, be it water droplets fading upon reaching the ground, glass causing balloon string to snap, "One-inch punch" finish, we are looking at extreme details and incredible beauty of martial arts, which have NEVER been present in Ip Man 1 and 2.\n\nDirector Wilson Yip's way of expressing his ideas in Ip Man 3 is that much deeper than previous films. Be it hinting "Be like water", or the first scene of "Butterfly"(a Chinese mythology of a returning spirit of a love one, key hint to subsequent events in the film), there are many details which ordinary viewers might overlook, but observant viewers will fall in love with the film.\n\nNow, refocusing back on Donnie Yen. Many fans will be watching Ip Man 3 simply because Donnie is back as Ip Man, and to many people... "Donnie Yen IS Ip Man", and there have been voices of boycott of other unrelated Yip Mun films starring other actors.\n\nFor fans of Donnie Yen, his performance will not disappoint you. His performance as a grounded, highly-skilled martial artist continue to impress, but its his work as a father and as a husband that will stay in our hearts forever. Ip Man is willing to give up his cigarette addiction for his family, and to give up any prestige and reputation for his son(when he was kidnapped) and his wife(to spend more time with her).\n\nDonnie's performance in his movie alone, is capable of leaving audiences in tears in the cinema. His jokes in the films are excellent, while his emotional scenes touch the hearts of every audience.\n\nTo sum it all up, Ip Man 3 is the excellent and perhaps perfect ending to the Ip Man trilogy. But one needs to use his/her heart to understand, and use their eyes to observe.. not just the fight scenes, but every emotional scene.\n\nIp Man 3 has improved dramatically from the previous 2 installments, due to the additional of love stories and humour, besides incredible action by Yuen Woo Ping.\n\nWhile many is claiming that Ip Man 3 is the best of the trilogy, I will not go so far as that. I personally felt that Ip Man 3 is definitely better than Ip Man 2, and is definitely on par with Ip Man(2008).\n\nIp Man 3 and its previous 2 installments will definitely become classics, and Ip Man 3 will be a film we still talk about for decades to come, just like the Dark Knight Trilogy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52958,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-12-24","keywords":"wing chun,hong kong,bruce lee character,ip man character,martial arts","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ip Man 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3286219289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjM3ZTA4ZDUtNTQ1NS00OWQxLTg0YzUtZDc3N2JkN2NmZjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjM3ZTA4ZDUtNTQ1NS00OWQxLTg0YzUtZDc3N2JkN2NmZjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Ip Man 3","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0947447/","name":"Donnie Yen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3237713/","name":"Lynn Xiong","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1018221/","name":"Jin Zhang"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0948159/","name":"Wilson Yip"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015592/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0560592/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323668/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5335213/","name":"Tai-lee Chan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4183613/","name":"Lai-Yin Leung","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2774833/","name":"Edmond Wong"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Well, these kinds of films are remarkably fun and has impressive technical achievements but there's nothing else to merit in the end. The Crood is almost one of those simple crazy films if not because of the philosophy that was displayed on the premise. Basically, it's about a zany version of the prehistoric times and a survival on the continental drift. The conflict of this plot is the titular family's choices if they would choose to follow their overprotective father or a stranger who makes daring ideas to survive from the natural condition. Disappointingly, the conclusion goes to the easy way. It doesn't go beyond the comfort zone, but the visuals transcend. The animation is getting better and better. It's totally fun but there are things that could have been more complex.\n\nEverything is ought to be silly and hilarious. The beginning gives a set of ridiculous sequences to easily get to know about these characters. When it finally proceeds to the actual plot, it tells something sophisticated. It's an opposition between safety and getting away from your comfort zone. It ends up being obvious when it is suppose to be complex. But that is what the film wants, be simple and delightful all the way. The film doesn't necessarily need to be deep or emotional, but there is something clever to its concept that could have been smarter.\n\nThe best thing about the film is the characters. The performances simply brought them to life. Emma Stone perfectly gives her role a fitting personality. It sounds perfect for Nicolas Cage to play a caveman. He yells at a monkey in one scene which is a usual pleasure from him, but there is more to the Grug character than just yelling. While Cage is having fun, he brings a strong emotional depth to the rest of his scenes. The characters of Clark Duke and Cloris Leachman provide most of the laughs and they effectively show off its joy.\n\nThe visual effects are even more spectacular than the rest of the studio's films. Just like their recent films, it's snappy and energetic. The film's world looks amazingly eye candy and imaginative. The prehistoric characters and animals are wonderfully designed. The animal designs are meant to be ironic, like some of them got their food chain reversed eventually or their hybrid will some day become their fear. It's a slick joke. And for the 3D, you know it's great as long as it's from Dreamworks Animation.\n\nIt leaves a great amount of heart and fun, but its enlightenment theme results as being underwhelming and somewhat contrived. It would have made this more than just a typical Dreamworks film, but it doesn't matter because the movie is definitely suppose to be delightful for the entire family. It still takes some clever points. It's also great to see a load of spectacular animation. It is indeed truly enjoyable and full of life. The Croods is far from classic but this is kind of film that would enjoy anytime.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":203577,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"caveman,journey,cavewoman,elderly woman,family character name as title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi126265113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The world's very first prehistoric family goes on a road trip to an uncharted and fantastical world."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000092/","name":"John Cleese"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's an opposition between safety and getting away from your comfort zone. It ends up being obvious when it is suppose to be complex. But that is what the film wants, be simple and delightful all the way. The film doesn't necessarily need to be deep or emotional, but there is something clever to its concept that could have been smarter.\n\nThe best thing about the film is the characters. The performances simply brought them to life. Emma Stone perfectly gives her role a fitting personality. It sounds perfect for Nicolas Cage to play a caveman. He yells at a monkey in one scene which is a usual pleasure from him, but there is more to the Grug character than just yelling. While Cage is having fun, he brings a strong emotional depth to the rest of his scenes. The characters of Clark Duke and Cloris Leachman provide most of the laughs and they effectively show off its joy.\n\nThe visual effects are even more spectacular than the rest of the studio's films. Just like their recent films, it's snappy and energetic. The film's world looks amazingly eye candy and imaginative. The prehistoric characters and animals are wonderfully designed. The animal designs are meant to be ironic, like some of them got their food chain reversed eventually or their hybrid will some day become their fear. It's a slick joke. And for the 3D, you know it's great as long as it's from Dreamworks Animation.\n\nIt leaves a great amount of heart and fun, but its enlightenment theme results as being underwhelming and somewhat contrived. It would have made this more than just a typical Dreamworks film, but it doesn't matter because the movie is definitely suppose to be delightful for the entire family. It still takes some clever points. It's also great to see a load of spectacular animation. It is indeed truly enjoyable and full of life. The Croods is far from classic but this is kind of film that would enjoy anytime.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":203577,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"caveman,journey,cavewoman,elderly woman,family character name as title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi126265113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The world's very first prehistoric family goes on a road trip to an uncharted and fantastical world.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000092/","name":"John Cleese"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Because undergrads do that? They get attacked by wild dogs that turn out to be genetically engineered killers. Scary! History has taught me to stay away from anything labeled "Wes Craven Presents," but I decided to check this out because how bad could a movie starring Michelle Rodriguez vs Killer Dogs be? Rodriguez isn't the best actress, but I always enjoy seeing her one-note tough-girl shtick in movies or TV (long live Ana Lucia!) And she does her own stunts in this! There's no CGI, which is commendable, though I'm not entirely sure how I feel about a large number of dogs being trained to attack for the sake of a dumb horror movie. And this is, indeed, a dumb horror movie. All the clichés are intact, the writing is awful, and there's even a dumb subplot about brotherly love. Or something. Taryn Manning is cast as the "hottie" of the group, though she looks washed-up and talks like she smokes six packs a day. There's an interesting subplot with her character that would have made the movie more interesting had it been expanded upon. This is enjoyable for what it is, but it's nothing special.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13037,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2008-01-30","keywords":"island,cabin in the woods,animal attack,survival,natural horror","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Breed (2006)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1938424089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDJlZmNhMjItMGM4Zi00MGEyLThkNzUtZGJhY2MyOTQwNDVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDJlZmNhMjItMGM4Zi00MGEyLThkNzUtZGJhY2MyOTQwNDVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from First Look Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735442/","name":"Michelle Rodriguez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005029/","name":"Oliver Hudson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0543383/","name":"Taryn Manning"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0557608/","name":"Nicholas Mastandrea"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049118/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148083/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068448/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176256/","name":"Robert Conte"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0941810/","name":"Peter Wortmann"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In the age of the three-hour comedy, I thought it would be a relief to watch a laugher with a tighter belt. Unfortunately, even with the fast title, Less dragged on much longer than I wished it to.\n\nLess seems like a half-a**ed debacle, where everyone including the Captain jumped ship when they felt the movie sinking. The direction, if you can call it that, was done by Ruben Fleischer, who couldn't have possibly given his maximum effort on this film. His recent film success was directing the 2009 film Zombieland, which was a taut and intriguing comedy. Zombieland had a less original premise than Less, but consistently provided laughter and a few tense action sequences. Less similarly attempts to combine action and comedy, but provides an extremely flat and jumbled film.\n\nThe writing is slovenly. There are cheap laughs aplenty, and even a few good belly-busters, but laughter is inevitable when you try and force a joke every single line of the movie. My question is, why did the writers, and director for that matter, keep the crap that didn't stick to the wall? Watching Less felt like watching a movie shot in one take before it hits the editing room; so many intended jokes fall flat and fail to register. Even lazier than the joke writing is the character writing. Of course Less is a comedy, and an intentionally stupid one at that. Viewers shouldn't go in expecting to see detailed character development a la Mad Men; I certainly didn't. But the characters in Less change personalities and character traits on a whim and at an alarming rate.\n\nIn the movie's first scene, we see Jesse Eisenberg's character Nick, calmly and deliberately con two teenagers out of 40 dollars. But, after the first ten minutes of the movie, even before he gets the bomb/plot device strapped on his chest (which admittedly would make anyone change their disposition), he turns into a manic motormouth. The most offensive and unexplained character shift is that of the amateur criminal Travis, played by Nick Swardson (who in a side note needs to find a new agent after agreeing to star in the upcoming guaranteed bomb Bucky Larson. Find the trailer if you haven't seen it already; I almost clawed my eyes out in the theater seeing it before Less). Travis starts out as a complete imbecile, seemingly unable to think independently. Then, throughout the movie, Travis tries on about three or four different personalities before Swardson gives up altogether. And with writing that uneven, who could blame him?\n\nAziz Ansari predictably throws down the best performance in Less, and not simply by default. Unlike his stand-up comedy, which is a consistently high-pitched freight train of energy, Ansari is able to give his Chet character a dynamism I didn't expect from him. Sure, there are plenty of squeaky outbursts, but he knows that the outburst seems louder and more hilarious if there is a calm before the detonation. Ansari is the only actor relishing the gags, but unfortunately is fed plenty of misfired jokes by the writers as well. Danny McBride, deservedly renowned for his Kenny Powers character on HBO's Eastbound and Down, seems content to cash the paycheck and move on. He plays Dwayne, a much less funny Powers reprise, whose bumbling criminal character the writers mistakenly believe we care about.

In the age of the three-hour comedy, I thought it would be a relief to watch a laugher with a tighter belt. Unfortunately, even with the fast title, Less dragged on much longer than I wished it to.\n\nLess seems like a half-a**ed debacle, where everyone including the Captain jumped ship when they felt the movie sinking. The direction, if you can call it that, was done by Ruben Fleischer, who couldn't have possibly given his maximum effort on this film. His recent film success was directing the 2009 film Zombieland, which was a taut and intriguing comedy. Zombieland had a less original premise than Less, but consistently provided laughter and a few tense action sequences. Less similarly attempts to combine action and comedy, but provides an extremely flat and jumbled film.\n\nThe writing is slovenly. There are cheap laughs aplenty, and even a few good belly-busters, but laughter is inevitable when you try and force a joke every single line of the movie. My question is, why did the writers, and director for that matter, keep the crap that didn't stick to the wall? Watching Less felt like watching a movie shot in one take before it hits the editing room; so many intended jokes fall flat and fail to register. Even lazier than the joke writing is the character writing. Of course Less is a comedy, and an intentionally stupid one at that. Viewers shouldn't go in expecting to see detailed character development a la Mad Men; I certainly didn't. But the characters in Less change personalities and character traits on a whim and at an alarming rate.\n\nIn the movie's first scene, we see Jesse Eisenberg's character Nick, calmly and deliberately con two teenagers out of 40 dollars. But, after the first ten minutes of the movie, even before he gets the bomb/plot device strapped on his chest (which admittedly would make anyone change their disposition), he turns into a manic motormouth. The most offensive and unexplained character shift is that of the amateur criminal Travis, played by Nick Swardson (who in a side note needs to find a new agent after agreeing to star in the upcoming guaranteed bomb Bucky Larson. Find the trailer if you haven't seen it already; I almost clawed my eyes out in the theater seeing it before Less). Travis starts out as a complete imbecile, seemingly unable to think independently. Then, throughout the movie, Travis tries on about three or four different personalities before Swardson gives up altogether. And with writing that uneven, who could blame him?\n\nAziz Ansari predictably throws down the best performance in Less, and not simply by default. Unlike his stand-up comedy, which is a consistently high-pitched freight train of energy, Ansari is able to give his Chet character a dynamism I didn't expect from him. Sure, there are plenty of squeaky outbursts, but he knows that the outburst seems louder and more hilarious if there is a calm before the detonation. Ansari is the only actor relishing the gags, but unfortunately is fed plenty of misfired jokes by the writers as well. Danny McBride, deservedly renowned for his Kenny Powers character on HBO's Eastbound and Down, seems content to cash the paycheck and move on. He plays Dwayne, a much less funny Powers reprise, whose bumbling criminal character the writers mistakenly believe we care about. They inexplicably allow the movie to take a plot turn into his domain, yet the audience could care less what fate awaits him.\n\nGood comedy shouldn't be as strenuous a venture as it is watching 30 Minutes or Less. Luckily, we all live in the internet age, and while I no longer have this option, you can save your ticket money and watch Aziz Ansari stand-up videos on YouTube instead.\n\nFor my other movie reviews, visit http://scottsdoublefeature.blogspot.com","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98080,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2011-08-12","keywords":"unlikely criminal,strapped to a bomb,pizza delivery boy,sony vaio,heist gone wrong","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi563780633","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzkyNDUxNzY0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE2ODYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzkyNDUxNzY0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE2ODYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Two fledgling criminals (McBride and Swardson) kidnap pizza delivery guy Nick (Eisenberg), strap a bomb to his chest, and inform him that he has mere hours to rob a bank.

Spivet". The book, described by author Stephen King as a combination of "MarkTwain, Thomas Pynchon and Little Miss Sunshine", is illustrated with charts, lists, sketches and maps to help recount the adventures of the quirky, gifted 12-year-old boy of the book's title . Jeunet has faithfully reproduced the visual elements of the novel to recreate the offbeat world of T.S Spivet and the use of a 3D format is perfectly suited to breathing life into T.S.'s illustrations which Jeunet's does by drawing on his trademark mix of poetry and fantasy. But the plot does not lift from the page and the young boy's eventful journey seems flat and doggedly two-dimensional.\n\nThe adventure starts off promisingly enough. T.S.Spivet (Kyle Catlett) lives on a farm in the 'Big Sky Country' of Montana with his amateur entomologist mother (Helena Bonham Carter), his cowboy father (Callum Keith Rennie) and elder sister (Niamh Wilson). A phone call to the ranch from the prestigious Smithsonian Institute in Washington informs the young Spivet that he has won a prize for one of his inventions. Since the death of his twin brother in a shooting accident, Spivet's mother and father have sidelined the surviving son. Feeling neglected and un-loved, T.S. decides to travel on his own to Washington to accept his prize. The journey takes him across America on a freight train and into a series of encounters with a gallery of colourful characters.\n\nWhile the scenes in Montana are a triumph to Jeunet's bold, sweeping breadth of vision, once Spivet hops on the train, the action, conversely begins to falter. The characters he meets could have come straight from a cartoon strip – ageing sailor Two Clouds (Dominique Pinon) is a dead ringer for Popeye – and they add little or nothing to the narrative or the tone of the film.\n\nAs the lead actor, Catlett carries a lot of responsibility for one so young. No one can deny he is as cute as a button – with his oversized trousers and constant puzzled look – but he lacks the range of emotions needed to create real empathy. This may explain why a film about grief remains oddly unmoving until a a scene towards the film's finale which seems unashamedly designed to pull the heart strings. This latest Jeunet is undoubtedly a glorious visual treat, but it lacks the magic and mystery of 'Amélie' his most successful film to date.

Despite being a feature clearly made for under 12s, the film has a brutal environmental and political agenda of breathtaking ambition. This is presented with so little nuance or charm that, despite all the perfectly good arguments for ecological action, you somehow despise the animals who star.\n\nThe plot is paper thin, chaotic and occasionally plain nonsense. For instance, the plot insists environmental conferences achieve nothing but a conference of animals which tails off into a juvenile eulogy for a fantasy world somehow inspires the action required. Not even my three year old niece fell for that level of reasoning.\n\nWorst of all, I watched the entire film and, despite sharing the immediate area of the cinema with around twelve children of various ages, can honestly say they did not even smile once, let alone laugh. It is devoid of any entertainment value. I think you get the point.\n\nI wonder how the makers of this film can live with the amount of energy being wasted to give it distribution...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6383,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-07","keywords":"father daughter relationship,hero,heroine,fire,rabbit","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Animals United","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi162440473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjJiYWE5ZTctNjUyZS00YmJjLWExNjktOWRhNTgzMDgwM2RiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjJiYWE5ZTctNjUyZS00YmJjLWExNjktOWRhNTgzMDgwM2RiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Animals United"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179479/","name":"James Corden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000410/","name":"Stephen Fry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785227/","name":"Andy Serkis"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0459996/","name":"Reinhard Klooss"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1637852/","name":"Holger Tappe"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0118168/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234654/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4380835/","name":"Simon Hauschild"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1075038/","name":"Oliver Huzly"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0459996/","name":"Reinhard Klooss"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Despite being a feature clearly made for under 12s, the film has a brutal environmental and political agenda of breathtaking ambition. This is presented with so little nuance or charm that, despite all the perfectly good arguments for ecological action, you somehow despise the animals who star.\n\nThe plot is paper thin, chaotic and occasionally plain nonsense. For instance, the plot insists environmental conferences achieve nothing but a conference of animals which tails off into a juvenile eulogy for a fantasy world somehow inspires the action required. Not even my three year old niece fell for that level of reasoning.\n\nWorst of all, I watched the entire film and, despite sharing the immediate area of the cinema with around twelve children of various ages, can honestly say they did not even smile once, let alone laugh. It is devoid of any entertainment value. I think you get the point.\n\nI wonder how the makers of this film can live with the amount of energy being wasted to give it distribution...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6383,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-07","keywords":"father daughter relationship,hero,heroine,fire,rabbit","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Animals United","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi162440473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjJiYWE5ZTctNjUyZS00YmJjLWExNjktOWRhNTgzMDgwM2RiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjJiYWE5ZTctNjUyZS00YmJjLWExNjktOWRhNTgzMDgwM2RiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Animals United","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179479/","name":"James Corden","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000410/","name":"Stephen Fry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785227/","name":"Andy Serkis"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0459996/","name":"Reinhard Klooss","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1637852/","name":"Holger Tappe"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0118168/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234654/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4380835/","name":"Simon Hauschild","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1075038/","name":"Oliver Huzly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0459996/","name":"Reinhard Klooss"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

None of them are positive. \n\nThe Devil's Double is a "take no prisoners" film that's as hard to watch as it is entertaining. It follows Latif Yahia (Dominic Cooper), an Iraqi soldier from an upper class family, who is plucked from the war to act as Uday's double. Uday (also played by Cooper), remembers the comparisons the two would get when they jointly attended grade school. He asks Yahia to be his double - for both political and personal reasons. Like his father, Uday is in a constant state of worry over an assassination attempt. Further, he wants to send Yahia on personal trips that he himself doesn't wish to attend. Yahia, kind and warm, refuses, but is forced to with the threat of harm to his family. Yahia is given cosmetic surgery and dentures to complete the look.\n\nYahia is thrust into Uday's world. This is a world filled with rape, torture, murder, drugs, sex and money. The lifestyle that the Hussein's live is more than Presidential - it is royal. Immediately, Uday claims Yahia as his own property. Uday has grown into a monster, getting whatever he wants and never having to deal with the consequences. Yahia is who he wants. The atrocities he witnesses because of Uday disgust him, but he is stuck in this nightmare. We watch as Uday preys upon young girls walking home from school. We watch as he guts his father's best friend at a party. We watch Yahia struggle with the lifestyle he is forced to live. Uday's fascination with Yahia grows stronger and it enters your mind that Uday may actually be in love with his double. This doesn't necessarily mean in a romantic way, but because his love of himself is so great, that he sees Yahia as apart of himself.\n\nWhile the rest, as they say, is history, I certainly don't want to spoil the way the rest of the film plays out. This is a movie that you must see for yourself!\n\nThe acting in dual roles by Cooper, his first film as lead, is Oscar worthy. He gives both men their own voices, mannerisms and idiosyncrasies, that instantly allow the viewer to tell them apart. Subdued and stoic, Cooper plays Yahia as a guilt ridden man, grappling with the life he has been thrust into. He plays Uday as a manic, hyper madman with a broken smile and a creepy laugh. You literally believe they are two different actors.\n\nLatif is an ordinary man who is thrust into an extraordinary situation. An object of admiration for the President's son, he has no choice but to comply with the excruciating horrors that are put forth before him. Never once, however, do we seem his morals waver.\n\nWe know how it ends, but as with life, it's the journey that's important. The Devil's Double is the real life, Middle Eastern Scarface.

As he proved with his other film, "Gods and Monsters", Mr. Condon shows he doesn't mind tackling adult themes, so scarce in the present cinema.\n\nThe film is documentary in style, as we are shown the life of Kinsey at different times of his life. He had an unhappy childhood. His father was a tyrant who never really showed love toward him. There are moments when the young Kinsey is shown as boy scout and there is an element of homosexuality that maybe, for fear, never came to the surface, but it's there, nonetheless.\n\nDr. Kinsey's life takes a turn when he meets, Clara McMillen, who he calls "Mac". It's with her that he begins a life of discovery in the field of human sexuality that was taboo in American colleges and universities at the time. Albert Kinsey was the first one that spoke about the things that were never said in polite company, or in the classroom, up to that moment. His life was dedicated to understand what made human beings act the way they did, never being judgmental, but with a tremendous insight to interpret the data and present it in a comprehensible way.\n\nA puritanical American society reacted strongly against the findings of Dr. Kinsey. He was a man ahead of his times when he decided to gather information about the sex lives of Americans and to publish the results in a best selling book.\n\nAs Dr. Kinsey, Liam Neeson, showing an uncanny resemblance to the man, himself, does a wonderful job. He shows a complicated character who was not easily understood by his associates and students. As "Mac", his wife, Laura Linney with a dark wig, gives an articulate performance of Mrs. Kinsey. Both actors are wonderful together, as they have already shown in the New York stage. \n\nPeter Sargaard, as Clyde, Dr. Kinsey's first assistant, shows he is an actor that will amaze from picture to picture. This actor has the ability to get under each of his character's skins to make them real, as is the case with his Clyde. Also, almost unrecognizable, Chris O'Donnell, who plays Wardell, one of the interviewers working with the doctor. Timothy Hutton is Gebhard, the other associate who was instrumental in gathering the information to help complete Dr. Kinsey's report. John Lithgow, as Kinsey Sr. has a fantastic moment with Mr. Neeson, as he agrees to be interviewed, revealing a horrible secret. It's a wonderful moment done with panache by both actors working under exceptional direction.\n\nThere is a moment toward the end of the film where we see Lynn Redgrave speaking directly to the camera. It is one of the most effective moments in the film when this woman tells Dr. Kinsey about her life as a lesbian.\n\nMr. Condon's film clarifies a lot about the genius of Kinsey and his contribution to society.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48578,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-01-07","keywords":"sexuality,character name as title,surname as title,lgbt plus,sex","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Kinsey","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2224292121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjMyNjcwODktYjI3MC00ODVmLTlkOTktMmI5NDYyNzVhYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001473/","name":"Laura Linney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000563/","name":"Chris O'Donnell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102795/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0107069/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

My understanding is that Ford wanted to take on a role different than ones he had taken in the past to prevent type-casting, and while he does a good job in his role (as does just about everyone involved), the movie does slip up a little bit by having an almost nonexistent Russian presence in what is supposed to be the story of a Russian submarine.\n\nComparisons to the far superior Hunt for Red October are inevitable, and it is interesting to note that that movie was also about a Russian submarine but was presented all in English, but it doesn't lose credibility the way K-19 does, probably because it at least maintained a Russian accent, while Ford is speaking an unmistakable American accent and Neeson, well, Neeson is just Neeson and that's always good. He makes a great German but is less convincing as a Russian. I don't know why.\n\nNevertheless, as a story about an extremely important submarine mission rife with problems the movie succeeds brilliantly. K-19 is basically Russia's protection again nuclear war, which they fear the Americans might start at any moment. They hope to deter attack by showing evidence that they can issue destruction in return, and it is because of this that the sub is commissioned and sent on a mission to the polar ice caps to launch a test missile. There is a great scene where all of the crew and many other people are witnessing the launch of the submarine, and a woman swings a bottle of champagne on a rope to smash against the hull, but it bounces off unbroken. "We're cursed," one of the dismayed crewmen says. That woman must have felt terrible.\n\nThere is an immediate rivalry between Polenin, who understands the ship's limitations and wants them corrected before beginning the mission, and Vostrikov, who also understands the ship's limitations but also understands how important the mission is and so outranks Polenin's protests. One of the best things about the movie is that the dramatic action is pushed along by genuine concerns. The movie would have suffered terribly if they were ignoring such important problems with the submarine without good reason.\n\nOne of the best things about the movie is that it is able to create so much dramatic tension, even though it takes place during peacetime. There was a huge amount of political tension in the air, but there wasn't a war going on. This is why there is not a lot of concern shown when an American destroyer is sighted near the submarine, because one of the goals of the mission is for the Americans to see what they're doing.\n\nInstead, a small leak aboard the nuclear sub becomes a problem big enough to potentially start a war. Incidentally, one of the crewmen noticed something wrong with one of the dials at least twice before the leak was discovered (once before the ship left port). Had he reported that problem when he first noticed it, he could have saved the lives of everyone who died because of the radiation and prevented the entire thing. At any rate, once the leak is discovered, the options are to abandon ship and surrender the crucial technology to the Americans (a single concession which could dramatically alter the futures of the two nations, and thus rendering it unacceptable), try to repair the reactor without sufficient protection against the radiation, or scuttle the ship (also unacceptable because of the boat's importance).\n\nThere is a tense scene where Vostikov orders the ship to dive to almost crush depth, one of the obligatory scenes in submarine movies where the hull creaks and groans and everyone stares at the ceiling, like there's something to see there, and then he orders the ship to ascend at breakneck speed, surfacing through a layer of ice. Vostrikov intends to push the boat and the men to the limit so that they all know what the limit is, but unfortunately it culminates in a hugely disappointing display of digital effects as the ship breaks through the ice in something that looks more like it belongs in a cartoon than a serious film like this (I was reminded of the unfortunate Scrat's efforts to save an acorn from a splitting glacier in Ice Age).\n\nThe film requires an extra bit of suspension of disbelief to accept a story about a Russian submarine but without any Russian actors. I'm curious to know how it was received in Russia. I imagine it was a hit, despite the lack of Russian presence in the film, because it illustrates their courage and dedication to their country in the most difficult of times. But nonetheless, it is hugely effective and never lets up once it gets going. The ending strikes me as the part where the most creative liberties were taken with the original true story, leaving you with the feeling of a Hollywood ending imposed on a true story from Russian and American history. But if nothing else, the movie is a fascinating look at how close we came to widespread destruction during one of the most tense times in modern history.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":61869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-12-25","keywords":"radiation sickness,radioactive contamination,soviet union,submarine,nuclear submarine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"K-19: The Widowmaker","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4153606425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQ4NTRhMmEtZTBhNS00NTQ5LWI5YTktYWUyZmU3ZDg4OTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQ4NTRhMmEtZTBhNS00NTQ5LWI5YTktYWUyZmU3ZDg4OTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for K-19: The Widowmaker"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0819874/","name":"Sam Spruell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824220/","name":"Peter Stebbings"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000941/","name":"Kathryn Bigelow"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029472/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019266/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010183/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637491/","name":"Louis Nowra"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477370/","name":"Christopher Kyle"}],"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When Russia's first nuclear submarine malfunctions on its maiden voyage, the crew must race to save the ship and prevent a nuclear disaster." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0267626/","name":"K-19: The Widowmaker","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWY2YjIwNDAtYjQwOC00YjY5LTk2MDUtMjY4ZDdiMjdlNjIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"When Russia's first nuclear submarine malfunctions on its maiden voyage, the crew must race to save the ship and prevent a nuclear disaster.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0267626/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Anonymous_Maxine","dateCreated":"2008-05-10","inLanguage":"English","name":"It's frightening how close we came...","reviewBody":"K-19 has a massive cast, especially in the two lead characters of Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) and Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). My understanding is that Ford wanted to take on a role different than ones he had taken in the past to prevent type-casting, and while he does a good job in his role (as does just about everyone involved), the movie does slip up a little bit by having an almost nonexistent Russian presence in what is supposed to be the story of a Russian submarine.\n\nComparisons to the far superior Hunt for Red October are inevitable, and it is interesting to note that that movie was also about a Russian submarine but was presented all in English, but it doesn't lose credibility the way K-19 does, probably because it at least maintained a Russian accent, while Ford is speaking an unmistakable American accent and Neeson, well, Neeson is just Neeson and that's always good. He makes a great German but is less convincing as a Russian. I don't know why.\n\nNevertheless, as a story about an extremely important submarine mission rife with problems the movie succeeds brilliantly. K-19 is basically Russia's protection again nuclear war, which they fear the Americans might start at any moment. They hope to deter attack by showing evidence that they can issue destruction in return, and it is because of this that the sub is commissioned and sent on a mission to the polar ice caps to launch a test missile. There is a great scene where all of the crew and many other people are witnessing the launch of the submarine, and a woman swings a bottle of champagne on a rope to smash against the hull, but it bounces off unbroken. "We're cursed," one of the dismayed crewmen says. That woman must have felt terrible.\n\nThere is an immediate rivalry between Polenin, who understands the ship's limitations and wants them corrected before beginning the mission, and Vostrikov, who also understands the ship's limitations but also understands how important the mission is and so outranks Polenin's protests. One of the best things about the movie is that the dramatic action is pushed along by genuine concerns. The movie would have suffered terribly if they were ignoring such important problems with the submarine without good reason.\n\nOne of the best things about the movie is that it is able to create so much dramatic tension, even though it takes place during peacetime. There was a huge amount of political tension in the air, but there wasn't a war going on. This is why there is not a lot of concern shown when an American destroyer is sighted near the submarine, because one of the goals of the mission is for the Americans to see what they're doing.\n\nInstead, a small leak aboard the nuclear sub becomes a problem big enough to potentially start a war.

The theme – that of the 'inaccessible' stunningly beautiful, drop-dead gorgeous lady who simply has to glance at a guy to make him fall in love with her - now that's an experience that every male has had. Many of us simply steer clear of such females as they break our hearts as easily as some will pull the wings off birds, as they flit from male to male, savouring and enjoying the enormous power that they have.\n\nI loved that the script-writer actually got inside the head of the beauty and we experienced some of her angst as she tried to find the man who will love her for the rest of his life – and whom she can similarly love. Women like these (of all cultures) are often rather remote and aloof for most males.\n\nBut in this movie, she came alive! It is, of course, highly recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8970,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2012-10-31","keywords":"moscow russia,lie,woman tries on clothes,woman wears a thong,divorce","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Perfect Plan","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4162566169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ1Zjk2ODAtYmFmMy00Y2YyLTk0ZGUtNjMxYzkyZmJkMTVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ1Zjk2ODAtYmFmMy00Y2YyLTk0ZGUtNjMxYzkyZmJkMTVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for A Perfect Plan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1208167/","name":"Diane Kruger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200702/","name":"Dany Boon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1745743/","name":"Alice Pol"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154312/","name":"Pascal Chaumeil"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093197/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002435/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1552771/","name":"Laurent Zeitoun","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3557725/","name":"Yoann Gromb","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1181224/","name":"Béatrice Fournera"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Beginning to give up hope they will ever be rescued, a group of Rangers goes on a dangerous mission to try and save them.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0326905/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"eichelbergersports"},"dateCreated":"2005-08-03","inLanguage":"English","name":"Small tale told in a big way","reviewBody":"While Hollywood has gone after the Nazis and the European campaign in World War II over and over again, ad nauseam, little has been produced depicting the Pacific Theatre or the thousands of Americans and others who perished there.\n\nIn fact, only a handful of motion pictures have touched on the subject over the last two decades, namely Steven Spielberg's "Empire of the Sun," Terrance Malik's "The Thin Red Line," and the Nicolas Cage bomb, "Windtalkers." The best film in this genre was probably 1957's "Bridge On The River Kwai," which won Oscars for David Lean and Alex Guinness, among others, but that was almost 50 years ago.\n\nNow John Dahl ("Rounders," "Joyride," the TV series "Tilt") has shed some light on a little-known rescue attempt in the waning days of the conflict in the Philippine Islands. "The Great Raid" is a fine little film, smart, patriotic and fairly historically accurate.\n\nThe film begins with a crisp narration (accompanied by actual film footage) of the quick successes of the Imperial Japanese Army in the days following Pearl Harbor. Gen. Douglas MacArthur - thanks to Roosevelt's decision to devote more to the European effort through the Lend-Lease to Churchill program - is forced to evacuate the Philippines and retreat to Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of American troops are trapped by the swift-moving Japanese forces on the islands of Bataan and Corrigidor and are compelled to surrender. While WWII German brutality is everywhere in motion picture, few have addressed the stark horrors of the Bataan Death March.

The best film in this genre was probably 1957's "Bridge On The River Kwai," which won Oscars for David Lean and Alex Guinness, among others, but that was almost 50 years ago.\n\nNow John Dahl ("Rounders," "Joyride," the TV series "Tilt") has shed some light on a little-known rescue attempt in the waning days of the conflict in the Philippine Islands. "The Great Raid" is a fine little film, smart, patriotic and fairly historically accurate.\n\nThe film begins with a crisp narration (accompanied by actual film footage) of the quick successes of the Imperial Japanese Army in the days following Pearl Harbor. Gen. Douglas MacArthur - thanks to Roosevelt's decision to devote more to the European effort through the Lend-Lease to Churchill program - is forced to evacuate the Philippines and retreat to Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of American troops are trapped by the swift-moving Japanese forces on the islands of Bataan and Corrigidor and are compelled to surrender. While WWII German brutality is everywhere in motion picture, few have addressed the stark horrors of the Bataan Death March. Even this movie skirts the terror with a simple voice-over in filling in the background story of a group of surviving prisoners held for over three years.\n\nReceiving word of mass killing of American POWs by the Japanese, top brass in the Pacific orders a raid on a camp still behind enemy lines, led by Army Ranger Lt. Col. Mucci (Benjamin Bratt, "Law &amp; Order) and Capt. Prince (James Franco, "Spiderman," "Spiderman 2").\n\nMilitary minutia abounds with the planning and execution of the assault, which pits a handful of rangers against over 200 battle-hardened Japanese troops, led by sadistic Maj. Nagai (Motoki Kobiyashi).\n\nThe movie also shows the strong relationship between the Americans and Filipinos which was not the greatest in the years after the Spanish-American War, but was cemented against the common Nipponese enemy. Nice composition between rangers, prison camp and the occupied capital of Manilla, where civilian nurse Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielson, "Gladiator," "One Hour Photo")is working with the Filipino underground resistance.\n\nThis is no "Saving Private Ryan," and the acting sometimes leaves a bit to be desired, but the strength of the story, the fact it was inspired by true events, and the historical importance of the film, make this one a must-see, even for casual fans of the genre.

His "Sunshine" was lifeatleringly effective for me. He does things with a camera that are new, effective. He does better than others in providing a story foundation that fits the cinematic effects. He's visually clever. Its all more than enough for me.\n\nHere, he appeases audiences too much for my taste in building a happy ending that has you walking out actually believing that you have seen a happy romance, worthy of Bollywood dance fantasy. This, I suppose is his answer to those who were confused by "Sunshine"s failure to support a common genre. Alas, a shame.\n\nBut the cinematic bits are more than enough. \n\nQuite apart from the romance, what we have here is a (unique I think) synthesis of the film (here a TeeVee show) within that affects the film without plus a similar device of memory within. Here it is both a recall and a storytelling. The earlier in life we go, the more hectic and jagged the visions. It starts with one of the three "City of God" types of choppy editing and slowly bleeds into a normally paced picture. But that "City of God" stuff was mostly just in camera motion, and intended to contrast with the other two "personalities."\n\nHere it is in the camera, in the movement of the actors and deeply in the editing. Its integrated and cinematic. Its brilliant. I think that is because of the way Boyle has digested the results of Dogma 95. There was a lot of pretentious stuff in that manifesto, but its core and ultimately its effect has been the opposite of the intended. The capture of the natural to be true has to involve intrusive craft, not lack of craft. Boyle, without notice has picked up Dogma graduates for his crew, more this time than usual.\n\nThe beginning of this film is true, powerful, full of life, energy. It is real. As it progresses and our hero enters and is accepted into TeeVee land it becomes more romantic and unreal, more like a Bollywood romance. It is more powerful than any from Bollywood because we assume it to be real from the beginning. Clever.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":821358,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-03-18","keywords":"papadum,murder,india,non professional cast,prostitute","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Slumdog Millionaire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2220163097","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of how impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik became a contestant on the Hindi version of "Who Wants to be A Millionaire?" -- an endeavor made in  an effort to prove his love for his friend Latika, who is an ardent fan of the show."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2353862/","name":"Dev Patel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795661/","name":"Saurabh Shukla"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0849164/","name":"Loveleen Tandan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152921/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064479/","name":"Simon Beaufoy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3139511/","name":"Vikas Swarup"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His "Sunshine" was lifeatleringly effective for me. He does things with a camera that are new, effective. He does better than others in providing a story foundation that fits the cinematic effects. He's visually clever. Its all more than enough for me.\n\nHere, he appeases audiences too much for my taste in building a happy ending that has you walking out actually believing that you have seen a happy romance, worthy of Bollywood dance fantasy. This, I suppose is his answer to those who were confused by "Sunshine"s failure to support a common genre. Alas, a shame.\n\nBut the cinematic bits are more than enough. \n\nQuite apart from the romance, what we have here is a (unique I think) synthesis of the film (here a TeeVee show) within that affects the film without plus a similar device of memory within. Here it is both a recall and a storytelling. The earlier in life we go, the more hectic and jagged the visions. It starts with one of the three "City of God" types of choppy editing and slowly bleeds into a normally paced picture. But that "City of God" stuff was mostly just in camera motion, and intended to contrast with the other two "personalities."\n\nHere it is in the camera, in the movement of the actors and deeply in the editing. Its integrated and cinematic. Its brilliant. I think that is because of the way Boyle has digested the results of Dogma 95. There was a lot of pretentious stuff in that manifesto, but its core and ultimately its effect has been the opposite of the intended. The capture of the natural to be true has to involve intrusive craft, not lack of craft. Boyle, without notice has picked up Dogma graduates for his crew, more this time than usual.\n\nThe beginning of this film is true, powerful, full of life, energy. It is real. As it progresses and our hero enters and is accepted into TeeVee land it becomes more romantic and unreal, more like a Bollywood romance. It is more powerful than any from Bollywood because we assume it to be real from the beginning. Clever.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":821358,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-03-18","keywords":"papadum,murder,india,non professional cast,prostitute","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Slumdog Millionaire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2220163097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of how impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik became a contestant on the Hindi version of "Who Wants to be A Millionaire?" -- an endeavor made in  an effort to prove his love for his friend Latika, who is an ardent fan of the show.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2353862/","name":"Dev Patel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795661/","name":"Saurabh Shukla"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0849164/","name":"Loveleen Tandan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152921/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064479/","name":"Simon Beaufoy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3139511/","name":"Vikas Swarup"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Napeta ratna drama prati dva mlada britanska vojnika, koji dobivaju naizgled nemoguću misiju. U utrci protiv vremena moraju prijeći neprijateljski teritorij i dostaviti poruku koja će zaustaviti ubojiti napad na stotine vojnika, koji nemaju pojma da se napad sprema, a među njima je i brat jednog od dvojice vojnika. Oscarovac Mendes u filmu prikazuje zaista fantastične, ali i zastrašujuće ratne scene nismo do sada imali prilike vidjeti na velikom platnu.</desc>

His "Sunshine" was lifeatleringly effective for me. He does things with a camera that are new, effective. He does better than others in providing a story foundation that fits the cinematic effects. He's visually clever. Its all more than enough for me.\n\nHere, he appeases audiences too much for my taste in building a happy ending that has you walking out actually believing that you have seen a happy romance, worthy of Bollywood dance fantasy. This, I suppose is his answer to those who were confused by "Sunshine"s failure to support a common genre. Alas, a shame.\n\nBut the cinematic bits are more than enough. \n\nQuite apart from the romance, what we have here is a (unique I think) synthesis of the film (here a TeeVee show) within that affects the film without plus a similar device of memory within. Here it is both a recall and a storytelling. The earlier in life we go, the more hectic and jagged the visions. It starts with one of the three "City of God" types of choppy editing and slowly bleeds into a normally paced picture. But that "City of God" stuff was mostly just in camera motion, and intended to contrast with the other two "personalities."\n\nHere it is in the camera, in the movement of the actors and deeply in the editing. Its integrated and cinematic. Its brilliant. I think that is because of the way Boyle has digested the results of Dogma 95. There was a lot of pretentious stuff in that manifesto, but its core and ultimately its effect has been the opposite of the intended. The capture of the natural to be true has to involve intrusive craft, not lack of craft. Boyle, without notice has picked up Dogma graduates for his crew, more this time than usual.\n\nThe beginning of this film is true, powerful, full of life, energy. It is real. As it progresses and our hero enters and is accepted into TeeVee land it becomes more romantic and unreal, more like a Bollywood romance. It is more powerful than any from Bollywood because we assume it to be real from the beginning. Clever.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":821358,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-03-18","keywords":"papadum,murder,india,non professional cast,prostitute","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Slumdog Millionaire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2220163097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of how impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik became a contestant on the Hindi version of "Who Wants to be A Millionaire?" -- an endeavor made in  an effort to prove his love for his friend Latika, who is an ardent fan of the show.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2353862/","name":"Dev Patel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795661/","name":"Saurabh Shukla"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0849164/","name":"Loveleen Tandan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152921/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064479/","name":"Simon Beaufoy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3139511/","name":"Vikas Swarup"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There is pedigree and potential here too - the character is the protagonist of novelist Bill Granger's 1980s Peter Devereaux series, and if this movie adapted from the seventh book of that series hits paydirt, there are always many other books on which a franchise could be built.\n\nThankfully for Brosnan, who also produces the movie through his Irish Dreamtime company, 'November Man' is a sturdy enough thriller that could be the start of several such mid-budget European-set sequels to come. Gone are the gadgets, the girls and the quips that were a centrepiece of Brosnan's 007 days though - Brosnan's Devereaux is the kind of gritty spy Daniel Craig fashioned the 007 character after Brosnan departed, a no-nonsense CIA man at the top of his game who retired after a mission gone wrong with his protégé, David Mason (Australian actor Luke Bracey).\n\nDevereaux is pulled back into the field when his former handler from Langley, a hawk-eyed Hanley (Bill Smitrovich), asks for his help to pull an asset out of Moscow. The woman has critical information about the future head of the Soviet Union, Arkady Federov (Lazar Ristovski), which the CIA would like its hands on, but Devereaux accepts only because she is also his former colleague and lover. That simple mission goes unexpectedly awry when Devereaux finds himself pitted against Mason, whose orders were not only to 'take out' the woman but also Devereaux himself. What's more, Hanley is simultaneously taken into custody by his own CIA unit, after it turns out that he had recruited Devereaux behind their backs.\n\nAs scripted by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek, the film combines a couple of familiar tropes. Here we have a teacher and his best protégé turned enemies, so that we get to see just how much of the former's skills the latter has honed into his own. We also get a spy versus the Agency, with Devereaux seemingly gone rogue against the apparently corrupted CIA establishment. And finally, we get a witness everyone is after, who as Hollywood convention dictates, happens also to look like a supermodel - that would be Alice Fournier (played by former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko) - and is protected by none other than Devereaux himself.\n\nSo far, so good - for the first hour, Roger Donaldson directs a relatively taut and tense setup that keeps you hooked at trying to figure out just who is playing who. We know Devereaux is the good guy here, but just who is everyone else? Will Mason become a cold-hearted killing machine to take out his former trainer? Is Mason's boss the one pulling the strings? What does he have to do with an operation involving Federov and a building which fell in Chechnya that precipitated the war between the two countries? And just who is this Mira whom everyone is looking for, who apparently has Federov's dirty secrets from his past as a Russian general in the Chechen war?\n\nBut after a promising start, what was a tightly plotted affair starts to go off the rails. There are a lot of revelations here, and to be fair, a somewhat twisty knot of events to unravel the truth behind the smokescreens. Yet, the scripting gets weaker by the minute - in particular, a thoroughly extraneous scene where Devereaux confronts Mason in his own apartment and decides to teach the latter a thing or two about developing affections for the opposite sex by slashing the femoral artery of his next-door neighbour/ girlfriend for no other apparent reason - and the leaps of logic get more far-fetched as Donaldson tries his darnest to keep the proceedings moving at a brisk clip until the climax.\n\nNever a less than competent helmer, Donaldson largely succeeds, inserting some efficiently thrilling car chases, shootouts and hand-to- hand combats in between the betrayals, admissions and ultimatums. It certainly helps that Brosnan is just as sure a hand at playing a spy, slipping effortlessly into the role with charisma and lending this screen incarnation of Devereaux a dignity and poise that very few silver-haired action stars can do. Brosnan's co-stars are however forgettable, though Kurylenko proves to be a sight to behold in her own right when she puts on a short sexy dress to seduce Federov in his own hotel room.\n\nTo be sure, 'November Man' never quite comes close to the heights of Bourne, which is in a league of its own. But for less demanding audiences looking for some late-summer action, this entirely B-grade Euro-set thriller will do the trick. It's got espionage, suspense, blood, some sex (clearly trimmed here for an NC16 rating though), and most of all, Brosnan; yes, the latter is singlehandedly the best thing the film has going for it. And in turn, Brosnan gets his wish - an opportunity back into the spy game, and a pretty good one at that too.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66313,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-08-27","keywords":"stripper,premarital sex,sex standing up,sex scene,belgrade serbia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3721243673","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An ex-CIA operative is brought back in on a very personal mission and finds himself pitted against his former pupil in a deadly game involving high level CIA officials and the Russian president-elect.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3478396/","name":"Luke Bracey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1385871/","name":"Olga Kurylenko"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002044/","name":"Roger Donaldson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088199/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0500612/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3360218/","name":"Michael Finch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2244980/","name":"Karl Gajdusek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1952653/","name":"Bill Granger"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's incredibly strange and watchable...but also confusing and open to MANY interpretations. My advice is just watch it and see what you think.\n\nThe weirdness of this film doesn't surprise me that much since it stars Jake Gyllenhaal, an actor who seems to love taking chances with mind-bending and provoking scripts. Think about it...this actor hasn't just made one weird film but many...such as "Source Code", "Nightcrawler", "Brokeback Mountain", "Love and Other Drugs" as well as "Accidental Love"....all VERY unusual and difficult to categorize films. He certainly is a risk-taker....and I really appreciate that and seek out his films because of this.\n\nThe story is "Donnie Darko" is hard to describe....but I'll try. Donnie (Gyllehaal) is a disturbed high school student who apparently is in therapy after an incident involving arson. As the movie progresses, several things become obvious: he's brilliant, he can see the hypocrisy and bull around him, he's obsessed with time travel AND he's psychotic and dangerous. And, as the film progresses you see the world as he does...filled with all sorts of apparent delusions, including an imaginary friend dressed as a demonic rabbit, Frank. You KNOW all this will lead to something horrible...but what, you can't predict.

It's incredibly strange and watchable...but also confusing and open to MANY interpretations. My advice is just watch it and see what you think.\n\nThe weirdness of this film doesn't surprise me that much since it stars Jake Gyllenhaal, an actor who seems to love taking chances with mind-bending and provoking scripts. Think about it...this actor hasn't just made one weird film but many...such as "Source Code", "Nightcrawler", "Brokeback Mountain", "Love and Other Drugs" as well as "Accidental Love"....all VERY unusual and difficult to categorize films. He certainly is a risk-taker....and I really appreciate that and seek out his films because of this.\n\nThe story is "Donnie Darko" is hard to describe....but I'll try. Donnie (Gyllehaal) is a disturbed high school student who apparently is in therapy after an incident involving arson. As the movie progresses, several things become obvious: he's brilliant, he can see the hypocrisy and bull around him, he's obsessed with time travel AND he's psychotic and dangerous. And, as the film progresses you see the world as he does...filled with all sorts of apparent delusions, including an imaginary friend dressed as a demonic rabbit, Frank. You KNOW all this will lead to something horrible...but what, you can't predict. What also is odd is that despite being highly disturbed, Donnie is, somehow, on to something...but what?!\n\nThe film is a mind-bending experience. I didn't love it, but I really respect it for trying to do something unique.

Accept your place. Be a shoe.¨\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how well Korean director, Joon-ho Bong, made the transition to this his first English language film because the style and tone of the film still felt entirely Korean despite starring some well known Hollywood actors. I enjoyed this film so much that I ended up watching it twice and that is something I rarely do. Based on the French graphic novel, Le Transperceneige written by Jean-Marc Rochette, Snowpiercer is an ambitious dystopian sci-fi film that despite having a very absurd premise works really well thanks to Bong's direction. It has some great performances with memorable characters, several exciting action scenes mixed with bizarre comedic moments, and a thought provoking metaphor on classicism. It is a bleak film but Bong handled the material so well that it kept me engaged and interested. Unfortunately the film does suffer from a rather unconvincing final act, but for most of its running time I was so entertained that I wasn't too disappointed.\n\nSnowpiercer takes place in 2031 after a failed global-warming experiment has frozen all of Earth and wiped out all life. The only survivors are the passengers of a super train traveling across the globe with a perpetual-motion engine. Designed by Wilford, an engineer who knew the experiment would fail, the train has been running for 17 straight years and a social class system has developed as the passengers of the rear end live in extremely poor conditions. Here we are introduced to a young man named Curtis (Chris Evans) who is trying to come up with a plan to get past all the security guards in order to reach the front section where Wilford is presumed to be. He isn't alone on this quest as most of the passengers are upset for the abuse they've suffered and the extreme poor conditions in which they are forced to live in. A wise old man named Gilliam (John Hurt) who helped Wilford design the engine, has been helping Curtis rally the men together. Curtis's good friend, Edgar (Jamie Bell), is also awaiting the moment to begin their revolution as things begin to get worse once the guards take a few kids away from them. Tanya (Octavia Spencer) and Andrew (Ewen Bremner) are among the victims whose children have been taken away from them so they are also eager to attack. The first step of the plan involves freeing Namgoong (Song Kang-ho), a prisoner who has a special gift for unlocking the doors to each section, but the task won't be easy as the guards will do what it takes to make sure they stay at the rear section of the train.\n\nBong has directed several successful Korean films like The Host and Memories of a Murder, and in his first English language film his style remains untouched. Despite having some scenes that borderline in the ridiculous he somehow manages to balance those moments really well. For example there is this huge action scene that he has set up between the rebels and the guards who are awaiting them with axes. The bloody and violent confrontation begins, only to be interrupted as the train is approaching a bridge which serves as a landmark for the New Year. The fighting stops for a few seconds as everyone begins the countdown and admires the view of the outside world from inside the train, then the violence and mayhem continue. There are several moments like this where Bong perfectly balances these gorgeously crafted choreographed scenes with moments of quirky comedy and twisted sense of humor. The best example of this type of humor comes from the two characters played by Tilda Swinton (who is unrecognizable in this film) and Alison Pill who are terrific and steal the few scenes they are in. I really loved that classroom scene that felt completely out of place with the dark tail section of the train. I think it was those goofy moments that I enjoyed the most in this film. It was a great sensory experience to get to follow these characters through each section of the train and I have to give Bong credit for his visionary style because as our heroes progress to the front of the train things begin to get more and more bizarre and you never know what to expect. The film is short of being a masterpiece because the final 30 minutes are disappointing, but as a social satire Snowpiercer worked better than other recent sci-fi films like Elysium. It is a very weird and strange film, but it is really good and I enjoyed it even more on my second viewing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":343560,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-08-01","keywords":"train,perpetual winter,closed ecological system,population control,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1214688537","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTYwNjUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5MTAyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTYwNjUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5MTAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a future where a failed global-warming experiment kills off all life on the planet except for a lucky few that boarded the Snowpiercer, a train that travels around the globe, where a class system evolves.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0262635/","name":"Chris Evans"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068260/","name":"Jamie Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0842770/","name":"Tilda Swinton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0094435/","name":"Bong Joon Ho"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0364224/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0157434/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058896/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2441468/","name":"Jacques Lob"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499429/","name":"Benjamin Legrand"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2440893/","name":"Jean-Marc Rochette"}],"duration":"PT2H6M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This film has amazed me of the right balance, timing, touch, probability, possibility, and still continues to be a wonderful piece of storytelling at my 20th viewing. The premise is most simple, bordering on a soap opera plot. A gray-area guy wakes up against the corrupt and evil surrounding he used to be all right with. He gets to the bottom of his personal and professional life, and wants to crusade against all the wicked hands that feed him. The central theme here is anguish, which I do not know any worldly and sane person not to have. It is a story of greed, money, betrayal, violence, and self-doubts. A few secrets of this film's success, as far as performances go, I believe, are the followings: 1) the likable nature of George Clooney's character 2) the absolutely non-penetrative nature of the character of Tilda Swinton 3) the wonderful madness of the character of Tom Wilkinson 4) the cold-blooded charm of the character of Sydney Pollack. These four main players are with realism and acting internalization. The director Tony Gilroy must have been a great explainer to get all the characters understand inside-out of what they are, aren't, up to, and not up to, otherwise it would have led to shallower performances. I think it is rare to find a film enable us to understand and take a strange compassion towards the so-called "bad guys" (in this case, including one very bad girl). The reason is that everyone operates in fear and instability. No one is God and no one is Satan by design. "Michael Clayton" becomes the film's title because the bucks stop here. You can follow his final departure from the Grand Ball Room to the escalator and into a taxi, whose driver is instructed to "just drive for the $50's worth", and you can judge if Michael Clayton of the world can continue to be a shock absorber for them all, being Gods or Satans. My opinion is: it is a worthily meditative ending of a worthy film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":161232,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2007-12-26","keywords":"business,lawyer,poker game,faking a death,audio surveillance","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Michael Clayton","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2795045145","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg1YTFlMmMtNzVlZC00ZTgyLWFjNDktNmVmNjIzZjVjMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg1YTFlMmMtNzVlZC00ZTgyLWFjNDktNmVmNjIzZjVjMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Bros.

Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator, Eraser, the Governor of California) is Harry Tasker, a computer programming father by day, James Bond by night, working for a top secret government agency that is beyond the CIA and run by Charlton Heston. Tom Arnold, in his first dramatic role, plays Harry's partner, Gib, and is the smartass, class clown of the agency. Schwarzenegger and Arnold have a fantastic chemistry, creating the movie's biggest laughs. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Harry's under-appreciated wife, Helen, who flirts with the idea of leaving Harry for a used-car salesman, played with uber-confidence by Bill Paxson. Helen finds out the true identity of her husband in another funny scene where both are captured by Arab terrorists with help from a truth serum. The action part of True Lies comes from Harry trying to track down the nuclear bomb that has been stolen by the terrorists. A wonderfully shot escape scene on the bridge that connects the Florida Keys to the mainland is the pinnacle of True Lies. An action film that does not take itself too seriously (notice all of the silly Arnold-lines peppered throughout the movie, my personal favorite being "you're fired!" before Trump thought of it), True Lies is wildly entertaining, so much so that you almost forget Tom Arnold was married to Roseanne.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249003,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1994-07-15","keywords":"secret agent,spy,secret mission,remake,tango","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"True Lies","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi284754201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000130/","name":"Jamie Lee Curtis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000792/","name":"Tom Arnold"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000116/","name":"James Cameron"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956022/","name":"Claude Zidi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0584770/","name":"Simon Michaël"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436687/","name":"Didier Kaminka"}],"duration":"PT2H21M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His 'talent' will enable him to become an imminent member of the Nazi Party and to actively work in the eugenics process in order to improve the 'racial hygiene'. Kurt Barnert (Tom Schilling) is a young artist whose inspiration seems to be animated by repressed memories of his aunt Elisabeth May (Saskia Rosendahl), who mysteriously lost her mind during the rise of Nazism in the 30s, then silently 'disappeared' just before the Second World War: Elizabeth's fate will end at a fatal meeting with Professor Carl Seeband. A few years later, Kurt Barnert will accidentally fall in love with Ellie Seeband (Paula Beer), the only daughter of Professor Carl Seeband.\n\nFreely inspired by the life of Gerhard Richter, the film describes the three decades of a black and then red Germany, struck by two destructive ideologies, before being sold to capitalism. Without reaching the near-perfectness of Das Leben der Anderen (2006), this film is excellent: casting of first choice, neat photography, dialogues skillfully written, captivating scenario, a clever mix of sensual and sweet scenes alternately with cold and depressing other ones, ...

His 'talent' will enable him to become an imminent member of the Nazi Party and to actively work in the eugenics process in order to improve the 'racial hygiene'. Kurt Barnert (Tom Schilling) is a young artist whose inspiration seems to be animated by repressed memories of his aunt Elisabeth May (Saskia Rosendahl), who mysteriously lost her mind during the rise of Nazism in the 30s, then silently 'disappeared' just before the Second World War: Elizabeth's fate will end at a fatal meeting with Professor Carl Seeband. A few years later, Kurt Barnert will accidentally fall in love with Ellie Seeband (Paula Beer), the only daughter of Professor Carl Seeband.\n\nFreely inspired by the life of Gerhard Richter, the film describes the three decades of a black and then red Germany, struck by two destructive ideologies, before being sold to capitalism. Without reaching the near-perfectness of Das Leben der Anderen (2006), this film is excellent: casting of first choice, neat photography, dialogues skillfully written, captivating scenario, a clever mix of sensual and sweet scenes alternately with cold and depressing other ones, ...

I'm sure there are many more like this one that would be great for film as an avenue for people to learn about.\n\n SYNOPSIS: During the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, aspiring police officer Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) is working as security while he stumbles across a bag carrying a bomb. While law enforcement and the media praised him as a "hero" at first, the FBI begins to aggressively investigate the life of Richard Jewell as he becomes their number one suspect.\n\nDIRECTION: Clint Eastwood is great. I love him as a director and as an actor in most things I've seen with him, although I struggle to feel he did something no other Director could do. I'm really glad he chose this this story to put out to the world and whether it's purposeful or not, adding his name to this project will bring this story to more people. I don't want to give him too hard of a time though, because this isn't a film meant to focus around the direction. The story/writing of this film is the focal point and he still did a very good job getting it done. To add one negative I took away, there was a moment where an interview with the real Richard Jewell played on the television as his house and it through me off a bit.\n\nWRITING: The writing in this film was very good. It is based on a true story, so the story itself is largely what captured my attention. However, there are many movies based on or inspired by true stories where the writing couldn't really capture the heart of it and that is where the beauty of the writing lies. It's always hard to know exactly how everything went down and so whether this film is very accurate or mildly accurate, I'm glad they really focused on Richard Jewell and how it affected him and his family and how he was a real trooper through this whole process. There were a couple flaws that I did find with this film. There seemed to be some arc they were going for with Olivia Wilde's character that didn't really come to a close. Then with Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) and Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell), although their characters didn't have an arc to really be made with them, both of their parts ended quite abruptly. They were both vital to the story and the film didn't show me nor tell me anything about how either of those two continued after the fact. Well, there was a little info given about something Watson did, but nothing to do with Richard Jewell or his law firm that he had started (not a spoiler, was nothing integral to the story).\n\nACTING: The acting is so good in this film. I can't say it's Hamm's best nor does Wilde really get a chance to fulfill the arc of her character due to the writing, but none-the-less great actors. Then you have Kathy Bates and holy crap does she deserve a Best Supporting nom. All I hear is "of course she's great, she's Kathy Bates)... AND? I'm sorry I didn't know that when you're consistently great that you should be penalized for it or receive any less attention. I get we come to expect it, but then what's the incentive to give your all if you'll just be tossed to the side, because of your positive reputation. That's totally backwards to me. Then Nina Arianda who played Nadya was awesome! She didn't have many scenes, but her back and forth with Sam Rockwell was hilarious and wonderful. Now, lets get to Paul Walter Hauser. Wow. I'm sorry, but this man is neck-and-neck with Adam Driver for me. He has not even been nominated for a Golden Globe or SAG Award? Did they even watch the film? I mean Sam Rockwell was great in this film too, but he's another one of those "yea, but he's too good to nominate. Wouldn't be fare." Paul Walter Hauser shows so much emotion and is SO good at being a man who is holding in his anger, because he respects law enforcement too much. Then in the scenes where he breaks are just tremendous. I will be sorely disappointed if he is not nominated this year.\n\nCONCLUSION: Richard Jewell is a great story about one of American's greatest heroes who probably didn't get enough praise for the job that he did. The story itself and Paul Walter Hauser was enough for me to really enjoy this film, unfortunately there were some flaws with the story with some of the characters and some of the writing. In the end, I would definitely recommend this film for anyone to watch. Richard Jewell is the nicest man I have never met and this is just another story to show that doesn't matter how kind and genuine you are, you'll always have someone try to tear you down.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77034,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The film felt realistic. Moody, downbeat and desperate. I could feel his stress. I felt for the character. Even if I didn't really get to know him too well.\n\nI could understand the move to Denmark but the journey there was very fortunate. It relied on sparse filming and vague story telling. You have to just accept he went from UK to Denmark in the blink of an eye and with a lot of luck.\n\nThe love interest was also another very fortunate bit of story telling. It really did start to stretch reality a little. The speed of him being alone to having dinner was a challenge. No real attempt to create a loving romance.\n\nBut this disbelief would be dwarfed by the gun And police station scenes. It was like they run out of time and tossed a coin for the ending. Super rushed and super convenient. The ending very anti-climatic, yet Subtle and A little understated.\n\nThis is not a comedy. It is a young man at the end. Hopeless. Finding a reason not to give up. The acting was good so it was easy to travel the story. I wanted more from it but what I got was okay. The lead actor is appearing in a lot of productions just lately and this film explains why. I believed his character story so that is a credit to him. I do recommend it but save it for a chilled afternoon. #WearaMask","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1329,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-07-20","keywords":"one word title,country in title,dog,bus,riding a motorbike","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1417592345","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTIwODJlNWEtYjRlZC00MWQ1LWFlMjQtNDhlNjhjODk5NDU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTIwODJlNWEtYjRlZC00MWQ1LWFlMjQtNDhlNjhjODk5NDU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1245863/","name":"Rafe Spall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2362716/","name":"Darren Evans"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4629308/","name":"Elis James"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0792120/","name":"Adrian Shergold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199178/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0484683/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4074534/","name":"Jeff Murphy"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The film felt realistic. Moody, downbeat and desperate. I could feel his stress. I felt for the character. Even if I didn't really get to know him too well.\n\nI could understand the move to Denmark but the journey there was very fortunate. It relied on sparse filming and vague story telling. You have to just accept he went from UK to Denmark in the blink of an eye and with a lot of luck.\n\nThe love interest was also another very fortunate bit of story telling. It really did start to stretch reality a little. The speed of him being alone to having dinner was a challenge. No real attempt to create a loving romance.\n\nBut this disbelief would be dwarfed by the gun And police station scenes. It was like they run out of time and tossed a coin for the ending. Super rushed and super convenient. The ending very anti-climatic, yet Subtle and A little understated.\n\nThis is not a comedy. It is a young man at the end. Hopeless. Finding a reason not to give up. The acting was good so it was easy to travel the story. I wanted more from it but what I got was okay. The lead actor is appearing in a lot of productions just lately and this film explains why. I believed his character story so that is a credit to him. I do recommend it but save it for a chilled afternoon. #WearaMask","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1329,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-07-20","keywords":"one word title,country in title,dog,bus,riding a motorbike","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1417592345","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTIwODJlNWEtYjRlZC00MWQ1LWFlMjQtNDhlNjhjODk5NDU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTIwODJlNWEtYjRlZC00MWQ1LWFlMjQtNDhlNjhjODk5NDU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1245863/","name":"Rafe Spall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2362716/","name":"Darren Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4629308/","name":"Elis James"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0792120/","name":"Adrian Shergold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199178/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0484683/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4074534/","name":"Jeff Murphy"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is another of those Ron Howard based-on-a-true-story films, so don't take everything here as gospel truth....because it ain't so. (One example: in real life, Nash's wife was anything but as supportive as Jennifer Connelly was portrayed here.)\n\nThe first time I saw this film I was disappointed. Maybe I expected more, maybe I felt the story was unfair to the viewer and I felt like this was just one more attempt at Liberal Hollywood to make fun of those in the 1950s who were opposed to Communism. Well, on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago, I didn't have a problem with any of those things, just enjoying the performances and the classy-looking cinematography, thanks to one of the best cameramen in the business, Roger Deakins. I'm not always a fan of director Ron Howard, but his films are usually interesting and pleasing to the eye. He and Crowe seem to be a good pair, too, as witnessed by 2005's "Cinderella Man."\n\nFor those who enjoy a cerebral thriller, this is a very intriguing film. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas and Anthony Rapp all deliver solid supporting help and, if you haven't seen this, this story will deliver a big surprise. If you know the ending, a second viewing is even more interesting as you trace Nash's actions from the beginning.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":887814,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-03-06","keywords":"mathematician,schizophrenia,mental illness,nobel prize,game theory","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1801239321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNkYzBiMTgtOTRkOS00ZTAyLTkyZjItMWY0YjE5MjJhYzRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNkYzBiMTgtOTRkOS00ZTAyLTkyZjItMWY0YjE5MjJhYzRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000124/","name":"Jennifer Connelly"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000165/","name":"Ron Howard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326040/","name":"Akiva Goldsman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0621586/","name":"Sylvia Nasar"}],"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The owner, Nathan, pretty much created a search engine but he's gone a step further by creating an artificial intelligent woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) who the programmer is supposed to examine and question.\n\nEX MACHINA pretty much came out of nowhere and became a good hit across the world and I'm rather shocked that it did. Usually dumb science fiction movies with a lot of mindless actions are the ones that make money and not those that features very little to no action and instead just dialogue and thought. What really sets this film apart is the fact that it asks more questions than anything else and it expects the viewer to think about those questions and the impact that certain actions could have.\n\nThe visual style of the film is quite impressive and it's certainly a very interesting film to just look at. The music score is quite haunting and perfectly captures the mood of the film. There's the terrific cinematography that pulls you into the setting. The special effects are also extremely impressive. I loved the set and the look of this compound but the special effects are the real star. If you didn't believe that you were really looking at and operating with real artificial intelligent creatures then the entire film just wouldn't have the same feeling.\n\nThen there are the performances, which are a major plus.

The owner, Nathan, pretty much created a search engine but he's gone a step further by creating an artificial intelligent woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) who the programmer is supposed to examine and question.\n\nEX MACHINA pretty much came out of nowhere and became a good hit across the world and I'm rather shocked that it did. Usually dumb science fiction movies with a lot of mindless actions are the ones that make money and not those that features very little to no action and instead just dialogue and thought. What really sets this film apart is the fact that it asks more questions than anything else and it expects the viewer to think about those questions and the impact that certain actions could have.\n\nThe visual style of the film is quite impressive and it's certainly a very interesting film to just look at. The music score is quite haunting and perfectly captures the mood of the film. There's the terrific cinematography that pulls you into the setting. The special effects are also extremely impressive. I loved the set and the look of this compound but the special effects are the real star. If you didn't believe that you were really looking at and operating with real artificial intelligent creatures then the entire film just wouldn't have the same feeling.\n\nThen there are the performances, which are a major plus. Gleeson pretty much plays the role that is typically a nerd but the film never lowers the character to that simple term and instead makes him a very interesting person. Even the role of the billionaire played by Isaac isn't what you'd typically see and the actor brings a certainly coldness to the part.

I do hope that there are quite a few new series planned.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12369,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And I wasn't disappointed. There are so many things I love about this show, but most of all it is hilarious to watch the characters interact with each other. Kyra Sedgwick excellently portrays a tough woman who won't let people walk all over her. People complain that Brenda is a b****, but maybe that's the point. What fun would it be to watch a show with nothing but sweetness and joy between the main characters, no conflict whatsoever? The tension she endures and often causes just makes the show all the more entertaining.\n\nWhat is most irritating, however, is to hear people complain about how the perpetrators in each show is obvious.

And I wasn't disappointed. There are so many things I love about this show, but most of all it is hilarious to watch the characters interact with each other. Kyra Sedgwick excellently portrays a tough woman who won't let people walk all over her. People complain that Brenda is a b****, but maybe that's the point. What fun would it be to watch a show with nothing but sweetness and joy between the main characters, no conflict whatsoever? The tension she endures and often causes just makes the show all the more entertaining.\n\nWhat is most irritating, however, is to hear people complain about how the perpetrators in each show is obvious. Anybody who had listened what TNT had been saying about the show before it premiered would know that they said from the beginning that this show would be unlike other crime dramas in that the crime would not be the main focus. This show is ABOUT Brenda Johnson.\n\nSo, in conclusion, this is an excellent, intelligent, amusing show, and I am sad to see the season end.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24513,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

As the follow-up riding on "Housewives'" coattails, I was ready to dismiss it outright as "Ally McBeal in hospital scrubs." But not having much else to watch in that time slot, I decided to give it a try, and was I pleasantly shocked! Though there ARE some moments where the principal characters come off as self-centered, neurotic and at times downright eccentric, it never reached the level of absurdity that "Ally" often did, and thank God for that! Ellen Pompeo as Dr. Meredith Grey comes off as likable and probably more self-aware and introspective than self-absorbed and scatterbrained, though there are moments you do want to reach into the screen and give her a good shaking.\n\nAnd good call on the ensemble casting! You really have to give props to any show that FINALLY figures out how to effectively showcase the sweet-and-sour charms of Sandra Oh, who was good enough to elevate a sow's ear of a show like "Arli$$," if not to save it. And not to mention give assorted actors who have all been great in projects not up to their talents, the chance to really shine in some very well-written roles, and I want to single out Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, Chandra Wilson and especially T.R. Knight as George, who is really coming into his own as this season progresses.\n\nNot to snub Isaiah Washington, James Pickens, Jr., Kate Walsh or the so-hot-it's-criminal Patrick Dempsey. Seasoned vets all, it's just good to see them all land in a nice place where they can do great work with some sense of job security. (WE HOPE.) \n\nRealistic enough to be accessible but not a turn-off, and whimsically light enough at other times without straying into "Stefan-the-Frog" territory, (are you listening, David Kelley?), "Grey's" should remain as a dependable Sunday night staple as long as creator/producer Shonda Rhimes and her crew are able to continue to strike that balance, and keep its newfound audience interested and entertained with the trials, tribulations and trysts of the staff at Seattle Grace Hospital."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":279270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As the follow-up riding on "Housewives'" coattails, I was ready to dismiss it outright as "Ally McBeal in hospital scrubs." But not having much else to watch in that time slot, I decided to give it a try, and was I pleasantly shocked! Though there ARE some moments where the principal characters come off as self-centered, neurotic and at times downright eccentric, it never reached the level of absurdity that "Ally" often did, and thank God for that! Ellen Pompeo as Dr. Meredith Grey comes off as likable and probably more self-aware and introspective than self-absorbed and scatterbrained, though there are moments you do want to reach into the screen and give her a good shaking.\n\nAnd good call on the ensemble casting! You really have to give props to any show that FINALLY figures out how to effectively showcase the sweet-and-sour charms of Sandra Oh, who was good enough to elevate a sow's ear of a show like "Arli$$," if not to save it. And not to mention give assorted actors who have all been great in projects not up to their talents, the chance to really shine in some very well-written roles, and I want to single out Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, Chandra Wilson and especially T.R. Knight as George, who is really coming into his own as this season progresses.\n\nNot to snub Isaiah Washington, James Pickens, Jr., Kate Walsh or the so-hot-it's-criminal Patrick Dempsey. Seasoned vets all, it's just good to see them all land in a nice place where they can do great work with some sense of job security. (WE HOPE.) \n\nRealistic enough to be accessible but not a turn-off, and whimsically light enough at other times without straying into "Stefan-the-Frog" territory, (are you listening, David Kelley?), "Grey's" should remain as a dependable Sunday night staple as long as creator/producer Shonda Rhimes and her crew are able to continue to strike that balance, and keep its newfound audience interested and entertained with the trials, tribulations and trysts of the staff at Seattle Grace Hospital.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":279270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I love it!!! Its nice to have something lighthearted to watch. Life is already way too stressful why add more. I've already binge watched it three times (my life is full of a little too much reality right now) and I like it more every time. I love the 'love triangle' aspect with the 'under dog' winning. I absolutely love the character Wade.

As the follow-up riding on "Housewives'" coattails, I was ready to dismiss it outright as "Ally McBeal in hospital scrubs." But not having much else to watch in that time slot, I decided to give it a try, and was I pleasantly shocked! Though there ARE some moments where the principal characters come off as self-centered, neurotic and at times downright eccentric, it never reached the level of absurdity that "Ally" often did, and thank God for that! Ellen Pompeo as Dr. Meredith Grey comes off as likable and probably more self-aware and introspective than self-absorbed and scatterbrained, though there are moments you do want to reach into the screen and give her a good shaking.\n\nAnd good call on the ensemble casting! You really have to give props to any show that FINALLY figures out how to effectively showcase the sweet-and-sour charms of Sandra Oh, who was good enough to elevate a sow's ear of a show like "Arli$$," if not to save it. And not to mention give assorted actors who have all been great in projects not up to their talents, the chance to really shine in some very well-written roles, and I want to single out Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, Chandra Wilson and especially T.R.

As the follow-up riding on "Housewives'" coattails, I was ready to dismiss it outright as "Ally McBeal in hospital scrubs." But not having much else to watch in that time slot, I decided to give it a try, and was I pleasantly shocked! Though there ARE some moments where the principal characters come off as self-centered, neurotic and at times downright eccentric, it never reached the level of absurdity that "Ally" often did, and thank God for that! Ellen Pompeo as Dr. Meredith Grey comes off as likable and probably more self-aware and introspective than self-absorbed and scatterbrained, though there are moments you do want to reach into the screen and give her a good shaking.\n\nAnd good call on the ensemble casting! You really have to give props to any show that FINALLY figures out how to effectively showcase the sweet-and-sour charms of Sandra Oh, who was good enough to elevate a sow's ear of a show like "Arli$$," if not to save it. And not to mention give assorted actors who have all been great in projects not up to their talents, the chance to really shine in some very well-written roles, and I want to single out Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, Chandra Wilson and especially T.R. Knight as George, who is really coming into his own as this season progresses.\n\nNot to snub Isaiah Washington, James Pickens, Jr., Kate Walsh or the so-hot-it's-criminal Patrick Dempsey.

While the picture's main focus is on a group of lads who invest money in a high-stakes, rigged card game and lose, the broader story concerns approximately eight different groups of criminals whose paths cross (more&gt; than once, in some cases) during various illegal pursuits: money, guns, drugs, even revenge. The film is quite violent, both on and off screen, but it's also uniformly humorous throughout. It's important to note that the four central characters (a cook, a card sharp, and a couple of guys who sell "discounted" items) are interested only in acquiring the money to pay off their enormous debt; they kill no one. The same applies to the laid-back college boys who "grow copious amounts of ganja".\n\n The cast is comprised of mostly young, veteran, male actors. In fact, the only female in the film doesn't even speak, though she handles a machine gun fairly well. Sting appears briefly in several scenes as a bar-owning father figure. While his secondary performance is solid, as usual, it is also unmemorable. The soundtrack is first-rate, from the 60's hits of James Brown to the contemporary beats of London's underground. The groovy, pulsating music and lyrics are often succinctly synchronized with the action and dialogue in the film, creating a theatrical rhythm that is fairly uncommon in cinema (from any period).\n\n Critics and audiences over the years have often dismissed stylized camera work as pretentious and unnecessary, stating that it detracts from the story, bogs it down, or pads it; however, the film medium has the luxury of actually "displaying" a story for its audience, unlike the written word alone. It's what the medium is all about -- it's VISUAL. Hence, one of the reasons a filmmaker chooses such visual displays is to "brand" his or her work, in the same way as writers like Cummings, Hemingway or Joyce did with their medium. It's hard to imagine a cinema without Hitchcock, Kubrick, or Scorsese to represent it. To this end, Ritchie has taken his first step in establishing his own brand. His energetic, ultra-contemporary camera work incorporates (through a fresh perspective) such devices as slow motion, fast motion, and freeze-frame coupled with narration. It is at times reminiscent of (and actually expands upon) Martin Scorsese's patented visual stylistics and camera movements, like those found in 'Mean Streets' and 'Goodfellas'. But the similarities with Scorsese's work end there.\n\n Critics' endless comparisons of Ritchie's film with the works of Quentin Tarantino and Danny Boyle's 'Trainspotting' stand mostly unwarranted, as these comparisons take away from the inventiveness and originality of 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. Ritchie's film is a much more involved, complex, layered work than the aforementioned comparisons. While Tarantino's films are very strong on dialogue, screenplay, and editing, they often lack creative camera work and direction. Boyle's 'Trainspotting' does have a resembling "feel" to 'LS&amp;TSB', but aside from its Great Britain origins, there really is no need for comparison. 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is essential viewing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":558819,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1998-08-28","keywords":"gangster,dark comedy,violence,united kingdom,shotgun","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2274558233","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYyMzdmNTUtMmMxMS00NTFmLWFjNzItMzAxNDVlZThkZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYyMzdmNTUtMmMxMS00NTFmLWFjNzItMzAxNDVlZThkZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from PolyGram Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002076/","name":"Jason Flemyng"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002077/","name":"Dexter Fletcher"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0602941/","name":"Nick Moran"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046206/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024369/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000750/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While Tarantino's films are very strong on dialogue, screenplay, and editing, they often lack creative camera work and direction. Boyle's 'Trainspotting' does have a resembling "feel" to 'LS&amp;TSB', but aside from its Great Britain origins, there really is no need for comparison. 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is essential viewing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":558819,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1998-08-28","keywords":"gangster,dark comedy,violence,united kingdom,shotgun","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2274558233","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYyMzdmNTUtMmMxMS00NTFmLWFjNzItMzAxNDVlZThkZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYyMzdmNTUtMmMxMS00NTFmLWFjNzItMzAxNDVlZThkZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from PolyGram Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002076/","name":"Jason Flemyng","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002077/","name":"Dexter Fletcher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0602941/","name":"Nick Moran"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046206/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024369/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000750/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Though picks and shovels aren't required, the hours are long and the frustrations constant.  The code breaking process is complex, relying heavily on logic, mathematics, and the assistance of computers.  Code breakers themselves often are very weird people who make the common nerd seem comparatively normal.  Given all this, it's understandable that hardly any films, aside from documentaries, have been made about the lives and loves of code breakers.\n\n Until "Enigma", the one exception was "Breaking the Code", the story of Alan Turing, the mathematician perhaps most responsible for cracking the Enigma.  But Turing's story, though psychologically fascinating, has its limitations for conventional film makers, the most obvious being the difficulty in creating dramatic tension and the absence of any female love interest.\n\n Michael Apted's `Enigma' is the first real attempt to tell the story of the Bletchley Park code breakers within the framework of both a thriller and a heterosexual romance.  As might be expected given the historical circumstances, the thriller aspects come off as rather subdued and the romance, such as it is, as rather restrained.\n\n Set in the dreary England of 1943, where stiff upper lips were bearing the weight of four years of war, `Enigma' centers on mathematician Tom Jericho (Dougray Scott).  His day and night job is code cracking, but Jericho spends much of the film attempting to solve the mystery of the disappearance of his former lover, Claire Romilly (Saffron Burrows).   Jericho is assisted by the suitably frumpy Hester Wallace (Kate Winslet), but harassed by an elegant MI-5 officer named Wigram (Jermey Northam), who suspects him of both murder and treason.\n\n The disheveled Mr. Jericho and the dowdy Miss Wallace spend much of the film on a last-name basis as they poke through files and try to decode intercepts Claire had in her possession.  This leads them off into what seems a blind alley but eventually turns out to be the key to much of the mystery.  In the midst of all this, Tom manages to tear himself away long enough to return to work, make a breakthrough, and help his mates recover the keys to a code the Germans had altered, thus changing the course of a critical convoy battle in the North Atlantic.\n\n Slow paced and sometimes dense, `Enigma' is enlivened by Northam's portrayal of  Wigram, who has a habit of turning up at inopportune moments and making matters difficult for Jericho.  Northam has a lot of fun with this role and he looks great in his suits, providing a sharp sartorial contrast to the drab Jericho-Wallace line of wartime apparel.\n\n Although some critics have compared `Enigma' favorably to works of Hitchcock, Hitch's touch was always lighter and his pacing livelier.  And Dougray Scott is not Cary Grant any more than Kate Winslett is Grace Kelly, which is all well and good as this dark, serious film clearly benefits from the use of less glamorous performers.\n\n Historically `Enigma' is reasonably accurate, though only so far as it goes.  Alan Turing isn't even given a cameo and the original Polish contribution to the code breaking is barely acknowledged.  Unfortunately, the film was not shot at Bletchley Park, some of which still survives, but at various other sites in England and Holland.\n\n Recommended to those interested in code breaking and in World War Two. Others probably will find "Enigma" just that."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20731,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-09-28","keywords":"code breaking,traitor,world war two,bletchley park,spy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Enigma","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1084555545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRjYTdmYTYtNWY4ZC00N2FiLWEzZDUtNzk3MTc4ZDE5MGI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRjYTdmYTYtNWY4ZC00N2FiLWEzZDUtNzk3MTc4ZDE5MGI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779084/","name":"Dougray Scott"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004787/","name":"Saffron Burrows"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000776/","name":"Michael Apted"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076402/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010183/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057092/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365249/","name":"Robert Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001779/","name":"Tom Stoppard"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"Aladdin" will forever be associated to that wonderful week I spent in Disneyland, and it's only fitting if the movie is my favorite Disney film, slightly edging-out "The Jungle Book".\n\nI know I can get all rational in this review, analyzing what makes "Aladdin" such an appealing film and using the expected words of 'Disney Renaissance' and a comparison with the glorious Best Picture nominee predecessor. I can also talk about the animation, the music, the extraordinary multi-vocal performance of Robin Williams as Genie  but I don't feel like getting rational. I love the film for personal reasons that are essentially due to the excellent timing of this film in its penetration of my pre-adolescent life. "Aladdin" took a forever cherished place as one of the last treasures that enriched my childhood even playing a pivotal role in the way I would start enjoying cartoons.\n\n"Kid's day in the USA!" was the motto of the week that was celebrating the 65th birthday of Mickey Mouse, and for a kid who never traveled outside his country, going to Disneyland was the most unexpected destination, the most extraordinary trip I would never have dared to dream of. This is when I discovered "Aladdin", through the 'Prince Ali' fanfare endlessly performed during the parades, through the films' images aired on TV; something was strangely attracting me to the film. And I guess the fact that I knew the story helped a lot: I grew up with a French cartoon from 1969, titled 'Aladin and the Magic Lamp' recorded in an 80's videocassette, a movie I can recite (and sing) by heart, and there was also an obscure Manga 'Aladdin' film we watched at school before the summer holidays.\n\nNeedless to say I was already familiar with the story, and seeing it translated into Disney language was something I was excited to see. Would they talk about Aladdin's deceased father Mustapha? Would he live with his mother? What kind of roles would Genie play? Well one thing matters apart from these questions: I knew the story and I could understand the film even if I didn't speak English at that time   it wouldn't have helped me anyway because the airport was very noisy, so I just sat on my luggage, eating some candies, and I could understand who was who and what was everyone's scheme: obviously, Aladdin wanted to be a prince to marry the princess and Jafar to marry the princess to become the prince, and between them, the Genie would come to fulfill their dreams. So, I saw the film and I loved it.\n\nAnd for one year, before I would see it again, the music of 'Pince Ali' and 'A Whole New World' was the musical remembrance of that magical week in Disney World. And when I saw it again, it took another dimension: I finally understood the subtleties of the stories, I learned all the songs after repetitive viewings, and for months and months, I was transported by the 'Prince Ali' parade and its climactic conclusion and the romantic 'A Whole New World' and its beautiful opening, when Jasmine jumps on the carpet and the zoomed-out Rajah looks smaller and smaller, watching from the balcony. I saw the film so many times during my pre-teen years that I would never forget the first sensations it immersed me into, with an unexpected awkward one.\n\nI must confess that Jasmine was one of my first movie crushes and my idea of the ideal woman as a kid, I don't know why but the way she looked during the 'love at first sight moment' hypnotized me and the moment where I always melt occurs in the carpet ride, when Aladdin gives her the apple, when you understand that she understood who the Prince Ali is, there are no words to describe how incredibly sexy she looks at that very moment. The crush didn't last of course, and as I grew older and was disappointed with the 'Return of Jafar' sequel and the TV series, my interest for "Aladdin" declined and it was reduced to 'kid's stuff I used to like'.\n\nAnd then 10 years later, as a student, I saw the film again on my computer, eating a pizza, and something magical happened when the 'Whole New World' music started during the closing credits, my heart was inundated by a nostalgic torrent, so immense that I couldn't stop crying because it reminded me of the privileged place the movie occupied once in my heart. The magic was back, and whenever I was spending a good time with friends, we were having fun listening to these old Disney songs, and the clip of 'A Whole New World' was a must-see   and how glad I was to discover that I wasn't the only one who 'liked' Jasmine.\n\nI feel so concerned by this film and so deeply attached to it, that I don't want to spoil this review with critical or ecstatic reviews, the film is just thrilling, romantic, adventurous, and features certainly the greatest cast of supporting characters without it being the counterpart of a dull hero or heroine, there's not a single minute of the film that seems pointless and wasted and certainly not with a character like Genie. That's the best I could do to rationally 'explain' my love for "Aladdin".\n\nBut maybe because loving a film can also depend on external factors that influence your judgment, in the case of "Aladdin", everything contributed to make this my favorite Disney film ... for sentimental reasons yes, but who ever said they were wrong?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":389662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1992-11-25","keywords":"genie,three wishes,genie character,arab,princess","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi677035801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQyMjRhYjUtOGM1My00OTQzLWEzZTAtOThjM2Q3OTMyNmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQyMjRhYjUtOGM1My00OTQzLWEzZTAtOThjM2Q3OTMyNmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0918334/","name":"Scott Weinger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488306/","name":"Linda Larkin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166256/","name":"Ron Clements"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0615780/","name":"John Musker"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133018/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074039/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166256/","name":"Ron Clements"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0615780/","name":"John Musker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254645/","name":"Ted Elliott"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The follow-up and Vaughn's first sequel has enough of what 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' so good and is an entertaining film on its own but at the end of the day it feels like something is missing.\n\nLike some have said already, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle's' biggest flaw is the length, at nearly two and a half hours (much longer than the first film, which was just over two hours) it does feel too long by about 20-25 minutes or so and it does affect the pacing, which drags in place.\n\nEspecially when it tries to cram in a lot, not everything feels necessary and some of the narrative is on the flimsy and not quite as eventful side. For example Eggsy's excursion to Glastonbury did feel dragged out and didn't serve as much point to the story as it could have done. The first film had more content but wasn't bloated and everything served a point.\n\nAs enjoyable as the climax was, Poppy's defeat did feel anti-climactic, and Halle Berry is fairly wasted, as is Channing Tatum in what is essentially a pointless plot device role.\n\nHowever, like 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' has a huge amount to enjoy. It is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes and audacious production design, if just lacking the operatic grandeur of the first film in the action. Once again, the soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.\n\nVaughn does well on the whole directing, particularly on the stylistic elements and making the action as fun as possible. He does struggle maintaining narrative momentum at times however. Very like the first film, he not just achieves the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing, but but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things.\n\nAction-wise, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' is fun, especially a nod to the original's bar brawl, the snow gun fight, the opening and the deliciously bonkers climax. At the same, nothing is in the same league as the unforgettable church scene and they lack the unflinching grimness. Here, when it comes to the script, nothing leaves a bad taste in the mouth, it is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar, at times, and very witty (like the culture-clash elements), with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny moments. One does wish that the pacing was tighter and the story more consistently gripping.\n\nRegarding the cast, they are top notch. Colin Firth returns and does a phenomenal job playing against type, Taron Egerton isn't quite as likable as in the original but one is engrossed enough in his journey (the Glastonbury excursion could easily have been trimmed) and Mark Strong has the ability to turn beneath-him material into gold and he is as charismatic as ever. Pedro Pascal has a Burt Reynolds vibe to him and it comes over affectionately and amusingly.\n\nOne has to credit Julianne Moore as an understated but played with relish villain and Jeff Bridges once again showing how fine an actor he is. Was pleasantly surprised by Elton John, appreciate him as a singer and his importance in rock 'n' roll but was admittedly expecting him to be a mugging disaster but he sends himself up to scene-stealing entertaining effect.\n\nIn conclusion, a fun if inferior sequel where one can see why it has garnered fairly mixed reviews but still better than given credit for. 7/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":296276,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-09-20","keywords":"fighting,one against many,man cut in half,spy,sequel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi734968089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTYyYTE2MjgtMDNkMi00NGYyLTg3MjYtZjBiNGJkN2VmMGE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTYyYTE2MjgtMDNkMi00NGYyLTg3MjYtZjBiNGJkN2VmMGE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When their headquarters are destroyed and the world is held hostage, the Kingsman's journey leads them to the discovery of an allied spy organization in the US.

"Aladdin" will forever be associated to that wonderful week I spent in Disneyland, and it's only fitting if the movie is my favorite Disney film, slightly edging-out "The Jungle Book".\n\nI know I can get all rational in this review, analyzing what makes "Aladdin" such an appealing film and using the expected words of 'Disney Renaissance' and a comparison with the glorious Best Picture nominee predecessor. I can also talk about the animation, the music, the extraordinary multi-vocal performance of Robin Williams as Genie  but I don't feel like getting rational. I love the film for personal reasons that are essentially due to the excellent timing of this film in its penetration of my pre-adolescent life. "Aladdin" took a forever cherished place as one of the last treasures that enriched my childhood even playing a pivotal role in the way I would start enjoying cartoons.\n\n"Kid's day in the USA!" was the motto of the week that was celebrating the 65th birthday of Mickey Mouse, and for a kid who never traveled outside his country, going to Disneyland was the most unexpected destination, the most extraordinary trip I would never have dared to dream of. This is when I discovered "Aladdin", through the 'Prince Ali' fanfare endlessly performed during the parades, through the films' images aired on TV; something was strangely attracting me to the film. And I guess the fact that I knew the story helped a lot: I grew up with a French cartoon from 1969, titled 'Aladin and the Magic Lamp' recorded in an 80's videocassette, a movie I can recite (and sing) by heart, and there was also an obscure Manga 'Aladdin' film we watched at school before the summer holidays.\n\nNeedless to say I was already familiar with the story, and seeing it translated into Disney language was something I was excited to see. Would they talk about Aladdin's deceased father Mustapha? Would he live with his mother? What kind of roles would Genie play? Well one thing matters apart from these questions: I knew the story and I could understand the film even if I didn't speak English at that time   it wouldn't have helped me anyway because the airport was very noisy, so I just sat on my luggage, eating some candies, and I could understand who was who and what was everyone's scheme: obviously, Aladdin wanted to be a prince to marry the princess and Jafar to marry the princess to become the prince, and between them, the Genie would come to fulfill their dreams. So, I saw the film and I loved it.\n\nAnd for one year, before I would see it again, the music of 'Pince Ali' and 'A Whole New World' was the musical remembrance of that magical week in Disney World. And when I saw it again, it took another dimension: I finally understood the subtleties of the stories, I learned all the songs after repetitive viewings, and for months and months, I was transported by the 'Prince Ali' parade and its climactic conclusion and the romantic 'A Whole New World' and its beautiful opening, when Jasmine jumps on the carpet and the zoomed-out Rajah looks smaller and smaller, watching from the balcony. I saw the film so many times during my pre-teen years that I would never forget the first sensations it immersed me into, with an unexpected awkward one.\n\nI must confess that Jasmine was one of my first movie crushes and my idea of the ideal woman as a kid, I don't know why but the way she looked during the 'love at first sight moment' hypnotized me and the moment where I always melt occurs in the carpet ride, when Aladdin gives her the apple, when you understand that she understood who the Prince Ali is, there are no words to describe how incredibly sexy she looks at that very moment. The crush didn't last of course, and as I grew older and was disappointed with the 'Return of Jafar' sequel and the TV series, my interest for "Aladdin" declined and it was reduced to 'kid's stuff I used to like'.\n\nAnd then 10 years later, as a student, I saw the film again on my computer, eating a pizza, and something magical happened when the 'Whole New World' music started during the closing credits, my heart was inundated by a nostalgic torrent, so immense that I couldn't stop crying because it reminded me of the privileged place the movie occupied once in my heart. The magic was back, and whenever I was spending a good time with friends, we were having fun listening to these old Disney songs, and the clip of 'A Whole New World' was a must-see   and how glad I was to discover that I wasn't the only one who 'liked' Jasmine.\n\nI feel so concerned by this film and so deeply attached to it, that I don't want to spoil this review with critical or ecstatic reviews, the film is just thrilling, romantic, adventurous, and features certainly the greatest cast of supporting characters without it being the counterpart of a dull hero or heroine, there's not a single minute of the film that seems pointless and wasted and certainly not with a character like Genie. That's the best I could do to rationally 'explain' my love for "Aladdin".\n\nBut maybe because loving a film can also depend on external factors that influence your judgment, in the case of "Aladdin", everything contributed to make this my favorite Disney film ... for sentimental reasons yes, but who ever said they were wrong?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":389662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1992-11-25","keywords":"genie,three wishes,genie character,arab,princess","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi677035801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQyMjRhYjUtOGM1My00OTQzLWEzZTAtOThjM2Q3OTMyNmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQyMjRhYjUtOGM1My00OTQzLWEzZTAtOThjM2Q3OTMyNmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0918334/","name":"Scott Weinger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488306/","name":"Linda Larkin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166256/","name":"Ron Clements"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0615780/","name":"John Musker"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133018/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074039/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166256/","name":"Ron Clements"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0615780/","name":"John Musker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254645/","name":"Ted Elliott"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Did think there would be more adults, however, because the Green Lantern was something we read in my generation. Not sure if it's even around anymore. Being a fan of the comic book I had to go see it, and I was intrigued with the movie. After I got home I jumped on the computer and read the reviews. I was very disappointed with the professional reviews that cast stones at it, while at the same time, regular folk like myself thought it was a pretty good stab at the DC comic book version.

I felt like I was the only guy over 20 at the theater, which I guess isn't surprising anymore. Did think there would be more adults, however, because the Green Lantern was something we read in my generation. Not sure if it's even around anymore. Being a fan of the comic book I had to go see it, and I was intrigued with the movie. After I got home I jumped on the computer and read the reviews. I was very disappointed with the professional reviews that cast stones at it, while at the same time, regular folk like myself thought it was a pretty good stab at the DC comic book version. I guess I look for something different when I go to the movies. I go to unwind and enjoy myself for a couple of hours, and Green Lantern worked for me.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":276805,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-06-17","keywords":"comicbook movie,ring,spacecraft,alien,magical ring","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Lantern - 3D Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3445005593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDkxNjQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAzOTgzNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A test pilot is granted a mystical green ring that bestows him with otherworldly powers, as well as membership into an intergalactic squadron tasked with keeping peace within the universe.  more Â»","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515116/","name":"Blake Lively","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765597/","name":"Peter Sarsgaard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0132709/","name":"Martin Campbell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033149/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075528/","name":"Greg Berlanti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0973233/","name":"Marc Guggenheim"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

To add would only dilute it. Yes, your left pleading for more but that's not because it's left unsatisfactory. No, it's because during the entire film, you're absolutely riveted and captivated! People, this is Barry Levinsons film, headed by De Niro and Michelle Pheifer! Levinson is a genius at his craft as are the formers. This film is bleak and at times depressing but I promise you never for a second not so engaged in it! De Niro becomes Madoff physically even the way he walks. The cast is incredible. Finally De Niro immersed himself into a character that can portray his craft. This is one vehicle, the cast-directing-editing, that sums up to make a masterpiece! This is by far the most captivating, engaging, riveting movie I've seen this year by far!

I recommend watching in German with the English sub-titles, the language is so cool too and of course the music is some really cool German hip hop.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-08","keywords":"business,female front nudity,strippers,adult movie theater,unprotected sex","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1391248/","name":"Kida Khodr Ramadan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7194136/","name":"Veysel Gelin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3137668/","name":"Almila Bagriacik"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0312451/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352514/","name":"Hanno Hackfort","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1293138/","name":"Bob Konrad","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0472277/","name":"Richard Kropf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Staffel 3 [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1761132313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGM4MTZiYTgtZTlmNy00NzYyLWFkOTItOTU5OTlkOGM3OGU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGM4MTZiYTgtZTlmNy00NzYyLWFkOTItOTU5OTlkOGM3OGU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. \n\nTaking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.\n\nA film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man  and we cheer her for it.   \n\nUnlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.

It is not better than GoldenEye but it is good decent action movie with great explosions, dangerous stunts and great action. Who is my favorite James Bond 007? That will definitely be Pierce Brosnan no one else, since his first film GoldenEye. I saw this movie as a fifteen year old teen I even have a poster at home from this movie. I love this movie I thought Roger Spottiswoode did a good job directing it. I thought it had decent stunts, decent action, less humor than Roger Moore. If you agree with me good, if you disagree with me that is your opinion. Tomorrow Never Dies is the 18th entry in the official James Bond film series.\n\nPierce Brosnan makes his second appearance as Agent 007, James Bond heads to stop a media mogul's plan to induce war between China and the UK in order to obtain exclusive global media coverage. \n\nI love the opening scene in which in Russia Bond steals airplane with military missals and weapons who are been sold to international terrorist and brings them home. We see Pierce Brosnan flying an airplane. In real life Pierce Brosnan was scared of that airplane he thought the crew will killed him. You have a beautiful explosions from those airplanes. In Hamburg, Germany Bond breaks into the headquarters of Carver's media company and finds the office occupied by Henry Gupta, Carver's communications specialist and known techno-terrorist. He is been chased from security guys, because Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) makes entry and she touches the alarm. Bond is being fired by machine guns in which he flees great action sequences.\n\nBond drives a new car BMW 7 Series with a remote control on a cell phone Ericson. I miss those times in which we used Ericsson cell phone. In 2004 I had that phone for a year until it got broken and I had to buy a new phone. Bond with cell phone drives with his cell phone as a remotely without touching the steering wheel. I did read a complaint about this scene on IMDb that is not realistic and it shouldn't have been in this movie. Listen folks it is a fiction not realistic, it James Bond so who cares. I never mind that scene it was great action sequence in which Bond eluded his attackers and he drove his car off the wall ha ha.\n\nJames Bond and Wai Lin in Saigon, Vietnam jumped off the building in Carver's HQ. They escaped Carver's henchman and the flee off the building. They slide down Carver's poster while been handcuffed. Great action sequence in which Pierce Brosnan and Michele Yeoh drove handcuff on a motorcycle. That was incredible dangerous stunt. I read Michelle Yeoh did her own stunt on the motorcycle and it was really painful too sit on that bike her legs and body hurt her. Cars and helicopter chased them until they hanker the helicopter and it explodes. Practical effect real explosion no CGI or shaky cam real action. Bond in Vietnam that was interested story well done acted. \n\nBond on the ship a stealth craft that is invisible on the radar uses hand grenade and he actives with his watch the grenade explodes and he makes the ship visible on the radar. Bond kick's ass and he kill's on the end Carver. He throws Carver in to the sea drill excellent. Bond is fired with machine guns and he fires back killing several Carver's man.\n\nJonathan Pryce plays a good memorable villain, 'the emperor of the air,' Elliot Carver who was prepared to go to any length to increase the power of his media empire. If you think actor Jonathan Pryce did not a good job playing a bad guy. Watch him Ronin (1998) with Robert De Niro a year after this movie he played another bad guy.\n\nGötz Otto plays Stamper, the loyal psychopath henchman who follows Carver's orders murdering a group of shipwrecked British sailors. He was a good second bad guy but he wasn't memorable like Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp.\n\nJudi Dench is once again as M and she is more handsome and awesome than she was in GoldenEye. She is a good heart person in this movie I thought the actress did her job well. Samantha Bond, Joe Don Baker and Desmond Llewellyn - all reprise their "GoldenEye" roles.\n\nMichelle Yeoh did a good job as Wai Lin the new Bond girl she was awarded for the role of Wai Lin. A martial artist of considerable skills, she preferred to work alone - until she begins to trust 007.\n\nCarver's wife Paris was played by the great beauty, Teri Hatcher was excellent as Paris Carver's wife. She was good in her role and her performance. After an assassin kill's Carver's wife here we seen Bond's remorse and feelings, not a stone killer like Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace.\n\nTomorrow Never Dies (1997) is the eighteenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the second to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Roger Spottiswoode, with the screenplay written by Bruce Feirstein.\n\n10/10 Great Bond theme, it is my seventh favorite James Bond 007 movie in top ten favorite Bond films. I love this film to death and in my opinion it is way underrated.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":188805,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-12-12","keywords":"official james bond series,megalomaniac,media tycoon,world war three,ex boyfriend ex girlfriend relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What to Watch While You Wait for 'No Time to Die'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3602956569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"If the wait for 'No Time to Die' feels endless, we have three titles to make the time go by, including a heist film where Daniel Craig delivers both the action and delightful puns, a classic Bond title where the women don't pull any punches, and a trippy miniseries from 'No Time to Die' director Cary Joji Fukunaga."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006854/","name":"Roger Spottiswoode"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270761/","name":"Bruce Feirstein"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The good acting, the spot on cast, the refreshingly unbearable scares, the "Paul Verhovenesque" completely unnecessary but compellingly disgusting gore, the almost uniquely un-Hollywood ending... It's all there.\n\nWhat is even more amazing about this movie is that it's [re]creators have also managed to tap into what will surely be the unanimous expectations of the target audience. There are no unwanted and unnecessary messages of family values, cheese, cuddles, and love will conquer all, which is fabulous because it leaves far more room for classic lines like, "Tell him to shoot Burt Reynolds" and then the ketchup-tastic head shot that follows. Now you have to admit, that line really can't fit perfectly in to many movies but in the ever consistent mood of Dawn of the Dead, it's right at home.\n\nVing Rhames is easily the second best thing in the movie (second only to the fast moving, constantly hungry and occasionally limbless zombies) once he actually starts speaking, and it is welcoming that Sarah Polley's Ana is as composed as she is subtle which is great for the audience because for a change the lead female character is not screaming every 30 seconds because, oh my god, someone is trying to bite me whilst drooling oodles of blood and saliva all over my nice white t-shirt. again!\n\nHer character is only clichéd and therefore flawed once throughout the campaign. As the genius of the group, she is the first to work out that when people are bitten they become very ugly, very quickly and develop a penchant for biting others. However she is still inexplicably opposed to killing the aforementioned soon-to-be cannibals. I don't know about you but whilst she was still talking through the morale dilemma of killing would-be zombies before they turned, I'd already be choosing which sponge I was going to use to clean my shoes after removing my trusty shot gun from a red blob that used to be somebody's face. Maybe that's just me though. us Sagittarians are very impulsive.\n\nSince we all have limited attention spans and I'm mindful of not giving too much away about what happens in the move, I'll wrap up by saying that those of you out there who enjoyed this film's original version and have gone on to enjoy films like Starship Troopers, Robocop, Resident Evil etc., then this is definitely the film for you. And even if the above are not representatives of your particular favourite genre, consider this. I went to the cinema with four friends tonight, one of whom stated before paying his money for the ticket, `I don't know why I'm bothering, I hate [rubbish] like this'. He was the one laughing the loudest and coming closest to vomiting throughout the film, and all of us came out saying, `how many Oscars has this been nominated for'..? Sarcastically - yes, but if it was nominated, it'd get my vote. The only thing that could have made it better was Steven Segal instead of Burt Reynolds but you can't have everything.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":247869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror"],"datePublished":"2004-06-02","keywords":"survival horror,mall,nurse,shopping mall,zombie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Guide to the Films of Zack Snyder","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1692647449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","description":"From 'Dawn of the Dead' and '300' to 'Zack Snyder's Justice League' and 'Army of the Dead,' we break down the stunning visual trademarks of director Zack Snyder."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001631/","name":"Sarah Polley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001616/","name":"Mekhi Phifer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086710/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010962/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013658/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

The good acting, the spot on cast, the refreshingly unbearable scares, the "Paul Verhovenesque" completely unnecessary but compellingly disgusting gore, the almost uniquely un-Hollywood ending... It's all there.\n\nWhat is even more amazing about this movie is that it's [re]creators have also managed to tap into what will surely be the unanimous expectations of the target audience. There are no unwanted and unnecessary messages of family values, cheese, cuddles, and love will conquer all, which is fabulous because it leaves far more room for classic lines like, "Tell him to shoot Burt Reynolds" and then the ketchup-tastic head shot that follows. Now you have to admit, that line really can't fit perfectly in to many movies but in the ever consistent mood of Dawn of the Dead, it's right at home.\n\nVing Rhames is easily the second best thing in the movie (second only to the fast moving, constantly hungry and occasionally limbless zombies) once he actually starts speaking, and it is welcoming that Sarah Polley's Ana is as composed as she is subtle which is great for the audience because for a change the lead female character is not screaming every 30 seconds because, oh my god, someone is trying to bite me whilst drooling oodles of blood and saliva all over my nice white t-shirt. again!\n\nHer character is only clichéd and therefore flawed once throughout the campaign. As the genius of the group, she is the first to work out that when people are bitten they become very ugly, very quickly and develop a penchant for biting others. However she is still inexplicably opposed to killing the aforementioned soon-to-be cannibals. I don't know about you but whilst she was still talking through the morale dilemma of killing would-be zombies before they turned, I'd already be choosing which sponge I was going to use to clean my shoes after removing my trusty shot gun from a red blob that used to be somebody's face. Maybe that's just me though. us Sagittarians are very impulsive.\n\nSince we all have limited attention spans and I'm mindful of not giving too much away about what happens in the move, I'll wrap up by saying that those of you out there who enjoyed this film's original version and have gone on to enjoy films like Starship Troopers, Robocop, Resident Evil etc., then this is definitely the film for you. And even if the above are not representatives of your particular favourite genre, consider this. I went to the cinema with four friends tonight, one of whom stated before paying his money for the ticket, `I don't know why I'm bothering, I hate [rubbish] like this'. He was the one laughing the loudest and coming closest to vomiting throughout the film, and all of us came out saying, `how many Oscars has this been nominated for'..? Sarcastically - yes, but if it was nominated, it'd get my vote. The only thing that could have made it better was Steven Segal instead of Burt Reynolds but you can't have everything.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":247869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror"],"datePublished":"2004-06-02","keywords":"survival horror,mall,nurse,shopping mall,zombie","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Guide to the Films of Zack Snyder","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1692647449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","description":"From 'Dawn of the Dead' and '300' to 'Zack Snyder's Justice League' and 'Army of the Dead,' we break down the stunning visual trademarks of director Zack Snyder.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001631/","name":"Sarah Polley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001616/","name":"Mekhi Phifer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086710/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010962/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013658/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

Locomotive #8888 was pulling 47 cars, including some with hazardous chemicals, and ran unmanned for two hours and 66 miles at speeds of up to 51 mph. (***Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know how the real-life incident ended before seeing the movie***). Attempts to derail the train using a portable derailer failed, as did an attempt by police to shoot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which didn't work because the button has to be pressed for several seconds before the engine shuts down due to lack of fuel. A northbound freight train took succor in a siding area where the crew released its locomotive and waited for the runaway to pass. Like in the movie, they had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, a relative neophyte conductor. They proceeded to chase the runaway train and successfully locked on to the rear car of the runaway, then slowing it by applying the dynamic brakes or their locomotive. Once the runaway had slowed to 11 miles per hour, trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train, jumped on, and shut down the engine.\n\nWhile the movie starts somewhat bland it quickly picks up momentum for a realistic non-stop thrill ride. The realism is refreshing in this day and age of cartoony action blockbusters and their multiple "yeah, right" action scenes (not that there's anything wrong with those movies, as long as you're in the right mode). Washington and Pine make for good protagonists and you start to care about them as the story progresses. Moreover, the movie doesn't overstay its welcome at a mere 98 minutes.\n\nThe film was shot in numerous locations extending from central Pennsylvania to eastern Ohio, which serve up a nice rolling hills backdrop with the occasional river. Minor note: You'll observe a woodchuck scamper across the tracks in one scene where he/she thankfully DOESN'T become ground chuck.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: "Unstoppable" is worthwhile as a believable disaster thriller. While it lacks the potent subtext and overall greatness of 1985's "Runaway Train," it makes up for it with its realistic and kinetic tone, not to mention the fact that it's based on a true incident.\n\nGRADE: B","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-11-10","keywords":"train,runaway train,train engineer,freight train,train movie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Unstoppable: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3068790297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A rail company frantically works to prevent an unmanned, half-mile-long freight train carrying combustible liquids and poisonous gas from wiping out a city."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276484/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093560/","name":"Mark Bomback"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now Benedict wants his money back. Plus interest. Thus Ocean and his crew must scramble together what they owe; too hot to work in America, they set their sights on Amsterdam.... where, not so coincidently, Rusty Ryan (Pitt) has an ex-love (Zeta-Jones) who just so happens to be head of police and hot on their trail. But Benedict and sexy cop Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones) aren't the crew's only problem. Another thief under the alias of "nightfox" ( Vincent Cassel) is keen to battle it out with Ocean and his team; to decide who the best thief (or thieves) are. \n\nAnd there you have Ocean's 12; a film which falls too short in terms of wit, appearance, plot... and pretty much everything else in comparison to the original Ocean's 11.\n\nOne thing must be made clear, however; the cast is great. Spectacular really. There is a definite and rare chemistry between everyone; even Catherina Zeta-Jones, newcomer to the Soderbergh film. And it is indeed very rare to jam-pack a film with so many big name celebs without the film being ruined by too much star power and not enough of anything else. And these films do indeed have A lot of Hollywood star power in them; Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherina Zeta Jones, Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle... just to name the biggest names. And watching Ocean's 11, you can tell that the crew enjoyed making this film. Unfortunately, the audience may not gain the same pleasure as the actors did....\n\nIf you were like me, absolutely blown away by the chic and jazzy first film, then Ocean's 12 will be a disappointment. The first movie was simply 'classy'. All of the shots, every single take, camera angles were all very clean-cut, solid and very stylish. In this film however, Soderbergh decides to use the currently popular 'shaky cam' technique for some scenes. I can understand why. In this film, unlike the first one, the crew haven't had time to plan to perfection their 'pull'. In this film its a mad rush to meet Benedict's deadline and I suppose Soderbergh wanted to get that rashness and disorientation across. But it wrecks the film. He really should have stuck to his original idea of having it all snazzy, bold and clean. Plus it is confusing when the film snaps between past and present to explain how the crew made some of their robberies; it looks messy and ugly to change between shaky cam to the bolder scenes.\n\nSecondly, the laughs are fewer in 12 and the script is duller. Ocean's 11 had a quick-wit and many a memorable line. Ocean's 12 has to sink so low as to throw in an age joke for Clooney; "Do i look 50?". The plot is predictable; from Julia Robert's 'impersonation' to the crew's great escape. It's all very blunt and can be spotted a mile away. And the summing up of the 'pull' is a little confusing; past tense (there's that shaky cam again!). I cant give too much away but my personal opinion is that the explanation of how the team pulled of the robbery is a little confusing and a sort of "huh"? moment which you will need to disucss with other's who have seen the film, to make sure you absolutely understood everything.\n\nAll in all the film is a let down. By all means go and see it; if for no other reason than to drool over the gorgeous Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and George Clooney.... But do not get your hopes up. As the credits roll you will find yourself feeling cheated somehow. Ocean's 11 was a real gem but Ocean's 12 just leaves you pining for the original.... 5.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":375082,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2004-12-15","keywords":"heist,sequel,pretending to be pregnant,father daughter relationship,reference to spongebob squarepants","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Twelve","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1989804313","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxNzQ0NjAtNmI0MS00NzQ5LTkxNzItMjExMWU0M2Q0MTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxNzQ0NjAtNmI0MS00NzQ5LTkxNzItMjExMWU0M2Q0MTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024560/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1079776/","name":"George Nolfi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425138/","name":"George Clayton Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751207/","name":"Jack Golden Russell"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Ocean's Twelve: Directed by Steven Soderbergh. With Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney, Ed Kross. Daniel Ocean recruits one more team member so he can pull off three major European heists in this sequel to Ocean's Eleven (2001)." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0349903/","name":"Ocean's Twelve","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmJmYzBjNTktMTJjZS00ZGRhLWE1Y2QtOWQxZGU0Y2RmMjkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Daniel Ocean recruits one more team member so he can pull off three major European heists in this sequel to Ocean's Eleven (2001).","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0349903/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Sweet_Ophelia","dateCreated":"2004-12-11","inLanguage":"English","name":"Leaves you pining for '11'","reviewBody":"Three years ago Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his team stole 160 million dollars from Terry Benedict (Garcia). Now Benedict wants his money back. Plus interest. Thus Ocean and his crew must scramble together what they owe; too hot to work in America, they set their sights on Amsterdam.... where, not so coincidently, Rusty Ryan (Pitt) has an ex-love (Zeta-Jones) who just so happens to be head of police and hot on their trail. But Benedict and sexy cop Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones) aren't the crew's only problem. Another thief under the alias of "nightfox" ( Vincent Cassel) is keen to battle it out with Ocean and his team; to decide who the best thief (or thieves) are. \n\nAnd there you have Ocean's 12; a film which falls too short in terms of wit, appearance, plot... and pretty much everything else in comparison to the original Ocean's 11.\n\nOne thing must be made clear, however; the cast is great. Spectacular really. There is a definite and rare chemistry between everyone; even Catherina Zeta-Jones, newcomer to the Soderbergh film. And it is indeed very rare to jam-pack a film with so many big name celebs without the film being ruined by too much star power and not enough of anything else. And these films do indeed have A lot of Hollywood star power in them; Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherina Zeta Jones, Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle... just to name the biggest names. And watching Ocean's 11, you can tell that the crew enjoyed making this film. Unfortunately, the audience may not gain the same pleasure as the actors did....\n\nIf you were like me, absolutely blown away by the chic and jazzy first film, then Ocean's 12 will be a disappointment. The first movie was simply 'classy'. All of the shots, every single take, camera angles were all very clean-cut, solid and very stylish. In this film however, Soderbergh decides to use the currently popular 'shaky cam' technique for some scenes. I can understand why. In this film, unlike the first one, the crew haven't had time to plan to perfection their 'pull'. In this film its a mad rush to meet Benedict's deadline and I suppose Soderbergh wanted to get that rashness and disorientation across. But it wrecks the film. He really should have stuck to his original idea of having it all snazzy, bold and clean. Plus it is confusing when the film snaps between past and present to explain how the crew made some of their robberies; it looks messy and ugly to change between shaky cam to the bolder scenes.\n\nSecondly, the laughs are fewer in 12 and the script is duller. Ocean's 11 had a quick-wit and many a memorable line. Ocean's 12 has to sink so low as to throw in an age joke for Clooney; "Do i look 50?". The plot is predictable; from Julia Robert's 'impersonation' to the crew's great escape. It's all very blunt and can be spotted a mile away. And the summing up of the 'pull' is a little confusing; past tense (there's that shaky cam again!).

Stoga se počinje pitati jesu li njezini postupci doista vođeni slobodnom voljom ili nečim posve drugim...</desc>

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":695874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is a bizarre film, unnecessarily complicated, that assembles a top-notch cast, puts them into a tense situation with all the players in place, and then has nothing to do with them. It's like the writer forgot that you needed a third act; it's all rising action with no denouement.\n\nWashington plays Det. Frazier, a hostage negotiator who acts, literally, as if this is his first case. He has the obligatory younger partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor, "Serenity") who exists so Frazier can explain his theories and the obligatory ESU commander who wants to go in and shoot everyone (Willem Dafoe, sadly underused). Owen plays the bank robber, about whom frustratingly nothing is known except what he said into the camera in the trailer. Finally, Foster plays some sort of player amongst the Powers That Be who walks into the mayor's office, demands an update, and is given "every possible courtesy", etc. She serves no purpose whatsoever, not even in a clichéd action movie type of way like Dafoe and Ejiofor. The performances are the only good part of the movie, but there are times when you can tell that the actors wished they were in a better film. They're giving it their all, and they're getting no help from anyone else involved.\n\nSpike Lee is up to his usual tricks here, which, in this type of movie, is a very bad thing. The details of the heist itself I won't disclose. I can't. The action is, at best, vague - extremely brief scenes of vaults opening, hole-digging, hostage roughing up, and the usual bank-robber stuff are all the details we really get. It is also inter cut with scenes of the hostages recalling the heist; their recollections serve no purpose except to confuse the audience further. "Inside Man" is curiously racist: the white crooks rough up the black bank customers, the white Foster and the mayor order around Washington, the white cops mistake a Sikh for an Arab and beat him, and even a Jewish hostage was not only a lawyer, but has a nephew who is a jeweler. Washington and Ejiofor are given no flaws whatsoever and are seen mostly being pushed around by everyone else in the movie. The action repeatedly grinds to a halt so Lee can insert quirky little subplots involving video games, Washington's much younger girlfriend and random Albanian women. They're at best unnecessary, at worst, disastrous. If we had been given a director with more focus, there is the feeling that this could have been a lean, mean thriller. But it drags and drags and drags and when we get to the end, we understand why the film stalled for so long: the ending is about as climatic as erectile dysfunction.\n\n"Inside Man" looked like it had it all - great cast, good concept, reputable director, but the end result is a near-disaster. It's like someone threw "Dog Day Afternoon" into a blender, drank it, and vomited it back onto the screen. As I stumbled out of the theater, deprived of my money and time, I cursed the screen gods who thought to tease me with such an improbably bad movie. I thought back to a better day, when a movie at least knew what was going on even if the audience didn't, gave us characters who seemed like actual people and served actual purposes to the plot, so that even if we had to wait until the Big Twist to answer our questions, we at least had a reason to still care."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356059,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I thought back to a better day, when a movie at least knew what was going on even if the audience didn't, gave us characters who seemed like actual people and served actual purposes to the plot, so that even if we had to wait until the Big Twist to answer our questions, we at least had a reason to still care.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356059,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A.-a. Od kreatorice / scenaristice / zvijezde Isse Rae, serija "Nesigurna" bavi se nerazdvojnom grupom prijateljica, milenijalki i crnkinja koje navigiraju neugodnim i formativnim iskustvima u srcu L. A.-a. Iako je sputava Molly, dugogodišnja najbolja prijateljica i korporativna odvjetnica koja se sjajno snalazi pred raznim odborima, ali ne i s osjećajima, Issa je strastvena graditeljica zajednice iz Inglewooda čija neodlučnost često omete njezinu viziju. Radnja se nastavlja nedugo nakon što su obje prijateljice dobile nogu od svojih partnera. Peta i posljednja sezona prati naše glavne junakinje, uz smiješnu Kelli i zahtjevnu Tiffany, kako pokušavaju stati na noge i nastaviti sa životom.</desc>

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over.

HBO donosi premijeru treće sezone za "Emmy" nominirane humoristične serije autora Armanda Iannuccija koja na oštar i satiričan način promatra zatvoreni politički svijet Washingtona. Dok prati vrtoglavu svakodnevicu potpredsjednice Seline Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), serija duhovito kritizira svakodnevnu uredsku politiku drugog najvažnijeg ureda u zemlji. Nakon otkrića na kraju druge sezone da se predsjednik neće kandidirati za nove izbore, treća sezona počinje tako što Selina, željna promaknuća, vrbuje stranačke aktiviste Iowe na potpisivanju svoje nove knjige "Neki novi počeci". Uskoro se Selina i njezino osoblje vraćaju u Washington za Mikeovo vjenčanje i saznaju da je ministar obrane Maddox dao ostavku.</desc>

Dok ostarjeli Hays kontemplira o svojoj istrazi s producentom dokumentarca o stvarnim zločinima, saznajemo više o slučaju i Haysovoj prošlosti prateći priče iz 1980., kad se zločin dogodio, i 1990., kad je šokantno otkriće ponovno probudilo interes za slučaj. Kroz ove flashbackove upoznajemo ključne likove poput Rolanda Westa, Wayneova partnera u vrijeme ubojstva; Amelije Reardon, učiteljice kao i okružne dužnosnike, FBI-eve agente, članove obitelji i osumnjičene.</desc>

Carrie Bradshaw je njujorška novinarka koja svoja opažanja o ljubavi i strasti objavljuje u kolumni "Seks i grad". Inspiracije joj ne nedostaje, jer sve što mora jeste saslušati svoje prijateljice dok joj se povjeravaju ili prepričavaju svoj posljednji izlazak. Uz nju su Samantha, vlasnica PR agencije, koja je na samačkoj sceni vidjela i isprobala sve, galeristica Charlotte koja još vjeruje da ljubav pobjeđuje sve i cinična Miranda, advokatica u velikoj kompaniji koja ima najmanje vremena za romanse, jer joj je karijera ispred nestabilnog ljubavnog života.

For a director to achieve this is a rare feat - as any Stephen King fan can sadly attest to after dozens of mediocre to downright terrible adaptations over the last four decades - and what's even more impressive is that it marks the second time Flanagan managed to pull this off, since he already knocked it out of the park with his Netflix adaptation of King's previously considered to be unfilmable novel GERALD'S GAME.\n\nNow the reason why those two films work so well is actually quite simple: like Frank Darabont and Rob Reiner before him, Flanagan gets that the most intriguing aspect of King's stories is not the horror. He's the rare director adapting a story by the writer who gets that it's not the supernatural, not the gory thrills or creeping chills that make those books so immersive and so well loved (though of course those are elements that we King fans also greatly enjoy): it's the meticulous worldbuilding and the deeply human characters.\n\nKing's novels - and Dr. Sleep is no exception - are so immersive because they're usually less about the horror itself and much more about the journeys he sets his characters on in confronting that horror, the world they inhabit and the people they meet along the way - and the strong bonds and friendships they forge. So in order for the adaptations to work on screen, it's crucial to retain the warmth and the humanity the writer infuses his protagonists with. The director's cut of DOCTOR SLEEP (which is the only cut I've seen), perfectly captures that aspect of King's writing. It has that special "King tone" - for lack of a better word - which so rarely survives the Hollywood treatment of his works.\n\nMy only - minor - gripe is that Flanagan focused his considerable talent on what I consider to be a somewhat mediocre book. If latter-day King is what he had to choose from, I wish he had picked BAG OF BONES or DUMA KEY instead, as his storytelling instincts would have been perfectly suited for both of those (admittedly also flawed) novels. There's some great stuff in there that could make for fantastic, haunting, beautifully Gothic genre films if a writer/director with Flanagan's old-school approach to storytelling and deeply humanist sensibilities were to tackle it.\n\nBut never mind my nitpicking; DOCTOR SLEEP is a treat for King fans as well as genre fans in general, and it's a shame it wasn't a bigger success at the box office. The movie is beautifully photographed, the cast - especially Rebecca Ferguson, Kyliegh Curran and Zahn McClarnon - are wonderful, and the deliberate pacing works perfectly for the story. So let's give it up for Mike Flanagan (who's apparently already busy adapting King's Lovecraftian novel REVIVAL); in the absence of Rob Reiner and Frank Darabont, he's perhaps the greatest hope for us King fans."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":171245,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2019-10-31","keywords":"based on the works of stephen king,hat,vampire,the shining,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi212254489","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUwMDBhNTEtNzc3Yi00NDU0LWEzZWYtMTEzYTJiZGEzNTk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUwMDBhNTEtNzc3Yi00NDU0LWEzZWYtMTEzYTJiZGEzNTk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Years following the events of "The Shining," a now-adult Dan Torrence meets a young girl with similar powers as his and tries to protect her from a cult known as The True Knot who prey on children with powers to remain immortal."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272581/","name":"Rebecca Ferguson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7738797/","name":"Kyliegh Curran"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1093039/","name":"Mike Flanagan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059753/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0084207/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1093039/","name":"Mike Flanagan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000175/","name":"Stephen King"}],"duration":"PT2H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There's some great stuff in there that could make for fantastic, haunting, beautifully Gothic genre films if a writer/director with Flanagan's old-school approach to storytelling and deeply humanist sensibilities were to tackle it.\n\nBut never mind my nitpicking; DOCTOR SLEEP is a treat for King fans as well as genre fans in general, and it's a shame it wasn't a bigger success at the box office. The movie is beautifully photographed, the cast - especially Rebecca Ferguson, Kyliegh Curran and Zahn McClarnon - are wonderful, and the deliberate pacing works perfectly for the story. So let's give it up for Mike Flanagan (who's apparently already busy adapting King's Lovecraftian novel REVIVAL); in the absence of Rob Reiner and Frank Darabont, he's perhaps the greatest hope for us King fans.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":171245,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2019-10-31","keywords":"based on the works of stephen king,hat,vampire,the shining,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi212254489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUwMDBhNTEtNzc3Yi00NDU0LWEzZWYtMTEzYTJiZGEzNTk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUwMDBhNTEtNzc3Yi00NDU0LWEzZWYtMTEzYTJiZGEzNTk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Years following the events of "The Shining," a now-adult Dan Torrence meets a young girl with similar powers as his and tries to protect her from a cult known as The True Knot who prey on children with powers to remain immortal.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272581/","name":"Rebecca Ferguson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7738797/","name":"Kyliegh Curran"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1093039/","name":"Mike Flanagan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059753/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0084207/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1093039/","name":"Mike Flanagan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000175/","name":"Stephen King"],"duration":"PT2H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Nemilosrdni i lukavi general Aulo Plaucije odlučniji je no ikad da osvoji ovu mitsku zemlju na krajnjem rubu Rimskog Carstva.

HBO donosi premijeru treće sezone za "Emmy" nominirane humoristične serije autora Armanda Iannuccija koja na oštar i satiričan način promatra zatvoreni politički svijet Washingtona. Dok prati vrtoglavu svakodnevicu potpredsjednice Seline Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), serija duhovito kritizira svakodnevnu uredsku politiku drugog najvažnijeg ureda u zemlji. Nakon otkrića na kraju druge sezone da se predsjednik neće kandidirati za nove izbore, treća sezona počinje tako što Selina, željna promaknuća, vrbuje stranačke aktiviste Iowe na potpisivanju svoje nove knjige "Neki novi počeci". Uskoro se Selina i njezino osoblje vraćaju u Washington za Mikeovo vjenčanje i saznaju da je ministar obrane Maddox dao ostavku.</desc>

When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.\n\nA few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her "typical teenager" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character.

When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.\n\nA few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her "typical teenager" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His "purpose" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.\n\nMost films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to "move" its viewers as much as this movie.

"Pravi detektiv" vraća se s trećom sezonom koja se usredotočuje na novi slučaj i predstavlja impresivnu novu glumačku postavu. Mahershala Ali igra glavnu ulogu Waynea Haysa, umirovljenog detektiva kojeg 35 godina muči slučaj nestanka 12-godišnjeg dječaka i njegove 10-godišnje sestre u gradu West Finger u Arkansasu. Dok ostarjeli Hays kontemplira o svojoj istrazi s producentom dokumentarca o stvarnim zločinima, saznajemo više o slučaju i Haysovoj prošlosti prateći priče iz 1980., kad se zločin dogodio, i 1990., kad je šokantno otkriće ponovno probudilo interes za slučaj. Kroz ove flashbackove upoznajemo ključne likove poput Rolanda Westa, Wayneova partnera u vrijeme ubojstva; Amelije Reardon, učiteljice kao i okružne dužnosnike, FBI-eve agente, članove obitelji i osumnjičene.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Možete pratiti jednu od najpopularnijih svjetskih serija"Seks i grad", koja prati živote četiri urbane žene i najbolje prijateljice iz New Yorka. Možete pratiti jednu od najpopularnijih svjetskih serija "Seks i grad", koja prati živote četiri urbane žene i najbolje prijateljice iz New Yorka u potrazi za ljubavlju, stabilnom vezom, razumjevanjem, seksom... Carrie Bradshaw je njujorška novinarka koja svoja opažanja o ljubavi i strasti objavljuje u kolumni "Seks i grad". Inspiracije joj ne nedostaje, jer sve što mora jeste saslušati svoje prijateljice dok joj se povjeravaju ili prepričavaju svoj posljednji izlazak. Uz nju su Samantha, vlasnica PR agencije, koja je na samačkoj sceni vidjela i isprobala sve, galeristica Charlotte koja još vjeruje da ljubav pobjeđuje sve i cinična Miranda, advokatica u velikoj kompaniji koja ima najmanje vremena za romanse, jer joj je karijera ispred nestabilnog ljubavnog života. Tema za Carriene kolumne je i Faca, zgodni i misteriozni tajkun koji joj uvijek ubrza otkucaje srca. Kristin Davis, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon i Sarah Jessica Parker uče nas važne lekcije o seksu, ljubavi, muškim i ženskim tajnama, uspješnim i neuspješnim taktikama, ispunjenim očekivanjima, skrivenim strahovima. Kada su u pitanju muškarci, veze i odnosi, ne možemo a da se ne zapitamo - da li smo zaista naučili sve?</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Seks i grad</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Možete pratiti jednu od najpopularnijih svjetskih serija"Seks i grad", koja prati živote četiri urbane žene i najbolje prijateljice iz New Yorka. Možete pratiti jednu od najpopularnijih svjetskih serija "Seks i grad", koja prati živote četiri urbane žene i najbolje prijateljice iz New Yorka u potrazi za ljubavlju, stabilnom vezom, razumjevanjem, seksom... Carrie Bradshaw je njujorška novinarka koja svoja opažanja o ljubavi i strasti objavljuje u kolumni "Seks i grad". Inspiracije joj ne nedostaje, jer sve što mora jeste saslušati svoje prijateljice dok joj se povjeravaju ili prepričavaju svoj posljednji izlazak. Uz nju su Samantha, vlasnica PR agencije, koja je na samačkoj sceni vidjela i isprobala sve, galeristica Charlotte koja još vjeruje da ljubav pobjeđuje sve i cinična Miranda, advokatica u velikoj kompaniji koja ima najmanje vremena za romanse, jer joj je karijera ispred nestabilnog ljubavnog života. Tema za Carriene kolumne je i Faca, zgodni i misteriozni tajkun koji joj uvijek ubrza otkucaje srca. Kristin Davis, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon i Sarah Jessica Parker uče nas važne lekcije o seksu, ljubavi, muškim i ženskim tajnama, uspješnim i neuspješnim taktikama, ispunjenim očekivanjima, skrivenim strahovima. Kada su u pitanju muškarci, veze i odnosi, ne možemo a da se ne zapitamo - da li smo zaista naučili sve?</desc>
