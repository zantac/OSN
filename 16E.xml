I thought Christmas with the Kranks was quite hilarious and ignored the sappy meaning of Christmas theme until the final 20 minutes. However once the movie reached that portion of the movie it slowed down painfully and left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nThe story is pretty basic, Blair Krank, played by Julie Gonzalo (Freaky Friday,) joins the Peace Corp. and heads to Peru during the holidays for a full year. The Kranks, Luther, played by Tim Allen (The Santa Clause 1, 2) and Nora, played by Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween, True Lies,) decide to boycott Christmas and head to the Caribbean on a cruise, much to the dismay of the neighborhood lead by Vic Frohmeyer, played by Dan Aykroyd (Ghostbusters, 50 first dates.) On Christmas Eve, Blair calls and tells her parents that she is coming home for Christmas with her boyfriend who wants to experience a true American Christmas with parties, snow and all of the trimmings. So it's a race against the clock to see if they can pull it off before she gets home.\n\nLike I said the beginning of the movie is quite hilarious. The scenes between the Kranks and their neighbors who want them to celebrate Christmas are the funniest I have seen in a Christmas movie since Natl. Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Luther with his Botox is just great.\n\nHowever, the last 20 minutes of the movie when the Kranks are trying to get the Christmas Eve party together, with the help of the whole neighborhood, drags the movie down a lot., so much in fact that you almost forget the laughter in the first act of the movie. There is also a pointless couple of scenes with a burglar that don't make since.\n\nI thought Tim Allen and Jaime Lee Curtis were cast perfectly for each other, all though at times Curtis reminded me of Patricia Richardson who played Allen's wife in the TV show Home Improvement. Along with Aykroyd, the supporting cast is full of very recognizable faces and some even provide humor to the story.\n\nOverall, I say that this movie is a pretty good Christmas movie. If the last half of the movie was as funny as the first half, and if they would have ignored the whole spirit of Christmas message, this movie would have been as great as my favorite Christmas movie of all time, the afore mentioned National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. However, since it wasn't and they didn't, this movie only gets a pretty good rating.

They make his Christmas the best one so far, and he makes the Christmas their best ever. By watching this with my grandfather, it really brought out the Christmas spirit in me. It really, truly did.

"If you liked Shrek ..." And it's so true. Fans of the first will be ga-ga over the second. The gang at Dreamworks was smart enough not to monkey around with a winning formula, so you have all the wit and charm of Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and all the fantastic fairy-tale creatures.\n\nAt the beginning of 2, Shrek and Fiona have been invited by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) to the family castle. Imagine their surprise when the honeymooning ogres show up! Seems the king and queen haven't heard that a) Fiona's an ogre and b) that her husband is one, too. Naturally, this doesn't sit particularly well with the king, and soon he's hired a hit man - Puss in Boots, no less, voiced by Antonio Banderas - to bump off his new son in law. Meanwhile, a Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) offers help to Fiona. And quickly, the main question of the film - conveniently, it was the main question of the first film - is whether love conquers all. Oh, perhaps it's a bit more complex than that - perhaps it's whether Fiona would love Shrek, no matter what he looked like. Come to think of it, that was the theme of the first one as well. \n\nShrek and Fiona journey to the land of Far, Far Away, where the stuffy king and the queen mum live. Far, Far Away is a clear knockoff of Hollywood itself (complete with the sign on the mountain), and the journey includes a pass through what looks like Beverly Hills. The attention to detail is marvelous, as always.\n\nAs with 1, 2 drops all sorts of Disney references, most resulting in full-out belly laughter. I was in stitches, although perhaps - just perhaps - some of the humor will zoom over your tiny tot's tiny head.\n\nShrek 2 is a beautifully done movie, perhaps even more entertaining than the original. Sure, at the end you know your emotions have been manipulated somewhat, but in the end you really don't care. Outstanding voice performances, flawless animation, and a crisp, moderately adult (but not mature, definitely not mature) script reign supreme.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":441517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2004-08-04","keywords":"reference to spider man,ogre,cat,princess,puss in boots","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shrek 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1447231513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRhNGQwNjUtYmFlMS00ODdiLWI3YTUtNjViOWYzZmU2YzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRhNGQwNjUtYmFlMS00ODdiLWI3YTUtNjViOWYzZmU2YzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Dreamworks"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000552/","name":"Eddie Murphy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011470/","name":"Andrew Adamson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0038432/","name":"Kelly Asbury"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0970447/","name":"Conrad Vernon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0825308/","name":"William Steig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011470/","name":"Andrew Adamson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0830294/","name":"Joe Stillman"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you think Micheal Douglas is an over rated actor then this movie is enough to prove you wrong. Sean Penn does full justice to his cameo. This is not a movie that leaves you with puzzles after watching unlike many mystery thrillers, instead it solves itself and relaxes your muscles after a rough ride. This is a movie with an engrossing script, excellent acting and flawless direction. If you have not watched this movie yet then PLAY it. You wont regret it all. Entertainment at its best. Now I can have my snacks and you go watch it. 8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":374689,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-09-12","keywords":"surprise ending,game,suicide,puzzlement,falling from height","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Game: The Criterion Collection [Blu-Ray]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3301942297","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDlkMTNkMWYtOWQ2OS00OTEzLWJkOGYtMGYzNDgyYjg1MWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDlkMTNkMWYtOWQ2OS00OTEzLWJkOGYtMGYzNDgyYjg1MWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Three Reasons Criterion Trailer for The Game","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000679/","name":"Deborah Kara Unger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000576/","name":"Sean Penn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000399/","name":"David Fincher"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030612/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058765/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045460/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104335/","name":"John Brancato","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274905/","name":"Michael Ferris"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Francuska serija pod nazivom "Profileri" predstavlja Chloé. Ona je kriminalistička psihologinja koja istražuje ubojice, a to je od velike pomoći policiji koja traga za istima zbog počinjenja zločina. Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

Snakehead (Julian Sands), your typical crook with world domination ambitions, has discovered the identity of a modern-day chosen child, and pursues him. Meanwhile, Hong Kong police detective Eddie Yang (Jackie Chan) and Interpol agents Arthur Watson (Lee Evans) and Nicole James (Claire Forlani) have been pursuing Snakehead because of his criminal activities, and stumble into the grander scheme.\n\nWhile The Medallion is certainly not a film without flaws, it is satisfying on the whole if you approach it as a comic book/cartoon-styled Jackie Chan actioner. The film combines even more genres than that, actually, and there are times when it seems almost to be a spoof of James Bond-styled thrillers. There are also more straightforward comedy elements--especially when Evans is on screen, the film almost becomes a slapstick farce--there are Matrix-styled fantasy/action aspects, and there is a romance subplot. On top of all of that, The Medallion moves very quickly. Director Gordon Chan packs a lot of information into the film and barely pauses for a breath--if you blink, you're likely to miss some bit of crucial action, a plot point, or a joke.\n\nIn short, it's a complex stew of different genres, with a mixture of adult themes and childlike lightheartedness, wrapped in a dense mythology of fantasy and served at a non-stop, breakneck pace. Undoubtedly, those qualities will turn off a great deal of viewers, whether because they hate MTV/attention-deficit-disorder-styled editing, genre hopping or a lack of real-world believability. I don't mind any of those qualities, and in fact I tend to prefer films that forgo realism.\n\nI only had two small complaints about The Medallion. One, it took me a few scenes to get up to speed with the film, both plot-wise and in terms of style. Once I got into the groove, though, I didn't want the film to stop--enough that my second complaint is that the film was too short (and in general, I strongly dislike the fact that most films seem to be forced by studios to end within 90 minutes). I wanted to see more of these characters, especially Evans, who stole most of the scenes he appeared in. Jackie Chan fans seeking a return to films that are solely kung fu-oriented will likely be disappointed, but if you have broader tastes, The Medallion might hit the spot. An 8 out of 10 from me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40777,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-12-24","keywords":"medallion,hong kong,martial artist,warrior,interpol","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Medallion","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3404726553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2U2MDNkOTgtZmE4ZC00MTIzLWJkZjUtM2Q2YjJlYzNlOTY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2U2MDNkOTgtZmE4ZC00MTIzLWJkZjUtM2Q2YjJlYzNlOTY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000329/","name":"Jackie Chan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0262968/","name":"Lee Evans"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001231/","name":"Claire Forlani"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0150906/","name":"Gordon Chan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047933/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102783/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0082064/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0156434/","name":"Alfred Cheung"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1424658/","name":"Bennett Davlin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0150906/","name":"Gordon Chan"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'm not mad at him, I'm just not in his target market.\n\nIf I didn't like movies so much, or reviewing them, I would've passed on this movie too. Surprisingly it was hilarious...thanks to the awesome little short man that goes by the name "Cedric" played by Kevin Hart. Otherwise it was an average movie about women being ruled by a book on relationships and men playing into predetermined roles. \n\nMore power to Steve Harvey for turning pages, and heads, but it's not one of my favorite movies to date.

I personally did not support the book because it was nothing more than a marketing tool used to make Steve Harvey more money. I'm not mad at him, I'm just not in his target market.\n\nIf I didn't like movies so much, or reviewing them, I would've passed on this movie too. Surprisingly it was hilarious...thanks to the awesome little short man that goes by the name "Cedric" played by Kevin Hart. Otherwise it was an average movie about women being ruled by a book on relationships and men playing into predetermined roles. \n\nMore power to Steve Harvey for turning pages, and heads, but it's not one of my favorite movies to date. It would fit perfectly in a sleepover blockbuster night for single women.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45976,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2012-07-11","keywords":"animated credits,four word title,african american,african american protagonist,interracial friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3746799129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE3MDAwNzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk5MTUxNw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE3MDAwNzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk5MTUxNw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four friends conspire to turn the tables on their women when they discover the ladies have been using Steve Harvey's relationship advice against them.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2093097/","name":"Chris Brown","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005517/","name":"Gabrielle Union","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366389/","name":"Kevin Hart"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1103162/","name":"Tim Story"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045552/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0146485/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2226647/","name":"Keith Merryman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2226970/","name":"David A.

Other than that, I really didn't know what to expect.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised in a few ways. Matthew Perry was playing his usual goofy character, as a result of total lack of any acting ability whatsoever. But Bruce Willis is always good, Amanda Peet stole the screen in almost every scene she was in, and the plot line was just quirky enough to be entertaining. Innovative and fresh, I found this film to be more creative than most of what's currently out in the theatres. It didn't have that formula imprint of so many Hollywood films (i.e. take the comedy formula off the shelf and cast it by Friday). I actually laughed out loud at a few moments.\n\nThe movie did go wrong in a couple of places. Being a Montrealer, I noticed a few things that most viewers might have missed. For instance that their obsession with Mayonnaise on hamburgers, which is integral to the plot, isn't based on any reality that I know of as I have yet to find a Montreal restaurant that puts mayonnaise on burgers. Rosanna Arquette's French accent is even worse than mine, even though it's supposedly her character's first language. Matthew Perry's love scenes with Natasha Henstridge are so ridiculously unrealistic, even the non-cynical will yawn.

Other than that, I really didn't know what to expect.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised in a few ways. Matthew Perry was playing his usual goofy character, as a result of total lack of any acting ability whatsoever. But Bruce Willis is always good, Amanda Peet stole the screen in almost every scene she was in, and the plot line was just quirky enough to be entertaining. Innovative and fresh, I found this film to be more creative than most of what's currently out in the theatres. It didn't have that formula imprint of so many Hollywood films (i.e. take the comedy formula off the shelf and cast it by Friday). I actually laughed out loud at a few moments.\n\nThe movie did go wrong in a couple of places. Being a Montrealer, I noticed a few things that most viewers might have missed. For instance that their obsession with Mayonnaise on hamburgers, which is integral to the plot, isn't based on any reality that I know of as I have yet to find a Montreal restaurant that puts mayonnaise on burgers. Rosanna Arquette's French accent is even worse than mine, even though it's supposedly her character's first language. Matthew Perry's love scenes with Natasha Henstridge are so ridiculously unrealistic, even the non-cynical will yawn. And the director seemed to have an obsession with pointing out Montreal landmarks, even if they had nothing to do with the plot.\n\nThose are small things in the grand context of the movie, though. If you liked movies such as The Big Hit, this is very similar. It's not meant to be taken very seriously, so the plot turns are more for absurdity's sake than for any kind of buildup of suspense.

The beginning is overlong and vaguely too fantastical, but once you realize this is a very different world, a comic book really, and normal rules don't apply, it can be forgiven. In fact most of the flaws can be forgiven because of Ron Perlman and what he brought to the picture.\n\nThis is one of few movies I've ever gone to see on the opening weekend, possibly the only one. And I did so because I was already a fan of Ron Perlman and it was great to see him in a leading role, even though he's covered in makeup. Perlman is the best thing in this movie; he is perfect as Hellboy. He swaggers through it as if he'd always been a leading man. Delivering one-liners with ease and to perfection, battling monsters through subterranean sets and city streets, and giving a great comedic performance as well as a very emotional one that makes you just love the big red oaf. A great feat considering the extensive makeup he had to act through.\n\nAnd the makeup and prosthetics are the best of its kind I've ever seen. There's movement and expression in the lips at times that you would think would be impossible. You might at first think that the lips are rather stationary and unexpressive, but if you just pay attention you'll see that there is a lot of movement and subtleties to it. Rick Baker should be praised for his work in this, it's amazing.\n\nDoug Jones is awesome as the body of Abe Sapien. His movements are truly beautiful. And David Hyde Pierce as the voice is perfect. Abe is a very interesting and neat character that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. And his makeup is as amazing or even more so than Hellboy's.\n\nJohn Hurt is great in this, as is Jeffrey Tambor. Everyone in this does a great job. But Perlman's performance as Hellboy really holds the movie together. His character stands out and speaks to the audience better than any other.\n\nIf you liked X-Men or Spider-Man don't expect a movie as well polished and put together, but you should be able to enjoy it and the more overt comic book feel of the movie. And unlike the aforementioned movies there is quite a bit of light humor throughout Hellboy that should garner some laughs from most anyone.\n\nHellboy isn't perfect, I would have changed some things, but I had fun watching it and in the end, especially for a movie of this type, I think that's what matters most. In fact I like it more now, after seeing it again, than I did when walking out of the theater.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":318157,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-04-02","keywords":"nazi,demon,superhero,hellboy character,hero","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hellboy","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3615007769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThjYmNkZDQtMzZlOC00MDBjLWE2NjQtMWJlNThiOTNjZWE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThjYmNkZDQtMzZlOC00MDBjLWE2NjQtMWJlNThiOTNjZWE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Hellboy"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427964/","name":"Doug Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004757/","name":"Selma Blair"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041635/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0186753/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1486009/","name":"Peter Briggs"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586005/","name":"Mike Mignola"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That stated, Aki Ross is still a more convincing character than ANYONE played by Keanu Reeves.\n\nFinal Fantasy is misnamed; there's little about the story that is "final", nor is it especially fantastic, but what it IS is a pretty decent mystical-science fiction (no, NOT "sci-fi" space opera) yarn. Possibly owing to the real inability to successfully portray facial expressions in the CGI characters, the mood throughout is sombre and hard... so rather more like real life than your average Hollywood space-opera swashbuckler. Frankly, because this story actually tries to make a POINT, it probably disappoints the type of viewer who would like a film like "Aliens".

That stated, Aki Ross is still a more convincing character than ANYONE played by Keanu Reeves.\n\nFinal Fantasy is misnamed; there's little about the story that is "final", nor is it especially fantastic, but what it IS is a pretty decent mystical-science fiction (no, NOT "sci-fi" space opera) yarn. Possibly owing to the real inability to successfully portray facial expressions in the CGI characters, the mood throughout is sombre and hard... so rather more like real life than your average Hollywood space-opera swashbuckler. Frankly, because this story actually tries to make a POINT, it probably disappoints the type of viewer who would like a film like "Aliens". The overriding message is simply that brute force is no use without understanding, and that's a timeless message that many cultures would do well to think about.\n\nAnd, of course, this film is just BEAUTIFUL.

Before you go and see The Da Vinci Code, let all the negative and positive hype surrounding this production cancel each other out, clear your mind, and judge this film fairly. Do NOT judge it on its usually weak director, do NOT judge it entirely on the source material and do NOT judge it on your religious beliefs. All this will be rewarding.\n\nI have not read the book so I will not attempt any kind of comparison. \n\nPlot essentially goes like this: In the middle of the night, Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned as an expert to a crime scene in Le Louvre where a terrible murder has been committed. The victim's body is self-placed in such a bizarre, symbolic way next to one of the world's most famous paintings that the investigation gradually unlocks age-old mysteries that many do not wish to be unlocked.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code is a chilling, thrilling and well-sewn together mystery thriller that often keeps you on the edge of your seat. The cast do not disappoint either. Paul Bettany is genuinely creepy as Silas and thereby reinforces the stereotype that all albinos are evil. While Audrey Tatou is annoyingly frail as Sophie Neveu, she is captivating and lovely and is able to project both charisma and presence on screen in this film. However, Tom Hanks did not at all feel like the protagonist in the story and I am unaware whether that was intentional or not but I'm guessing no, in which case Hanks definitely fails in both attracting and keeping our interest.\n\nSo the cast usually perform well (with the exception of Hanks) and the story is also facilitated by some very striking visuals. A big plus for this film which elevates it slightly above generic formula is its beautiful locations often seen through epic aerial shots. Good call, Howard! Another big plus is its distinctly Euro-centric feel in both style and substance. This surprised me since it is Tom Hanks and Ron Howard in the same film, but they do manage to keep the overblown Hollywood clichés to a minimum. This is even apparent in the score by Hans Zimmer; it is not overblown, but subtle and appropriate in the scenes to which it was scored. Similarly, Frenchmen do not speak English with a French accent when they were alone together, but speak in French. That said, the plot does unfold in a somewhat Hollywood fashion -- and the plot happens to be thinner than an Olsen twin.\n\nTo counter the good parts, two big minuses in The Da Vinci Code are its wooden and sometimes even placeholder dialogue and its distinct lack of humor. I felt the actors were much too serious for this kind of film, which is first and foremost an adventure story, fast-paced and constantly unlocking new mysteries. The issues in the film were serious enough and needed more comedy to balance them.\n\nAs I write this review, more and more bad points about it spring to mind. This is strange, since I remember sitting in the cinema with my friends just a few hours ago and being thoroughly entertained and captivated by the whole thing. So, never mind the occasionally insultingly far-fetched plot and plot-twists by Dan Brown; The Da Vinci Code is a nicely done and very entertaining film in which nothing feels missing or incomplete.\n\n7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":418760,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-17","keywords":"self flagellation,conspiracy,bare butt male,self punishment,bound and gagged","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Da Vinci Code","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2369847833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Blu-Ray trailer for this conspiracy thriller starring Tom Hanks"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000606/","name":"Jean Reno"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000165/","name":"Ron Howard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0124737/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326040/","name":"Akiva Goldsman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1467010/","name":"Dan Brown"}],"duration":"PT2H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A murder inside the Louvre, and clues in Da Vinci paintings, lead to the discovery of a religious mystery protected by a secret society for two thousand years, which could shake the foundations of Christianity." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0382625/","name":"The Da Vinci Code","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxMjQyMTc3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA1MDUzMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A murder inside the Louvre, and clues in Da Vinci paintings, lead to the discovery of a religious mystery protected by a secret society for two thousand years, which could shake the foundations of Christianity.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0382625/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Flagrant-Baronessa","dateCreated":"2006-05-23","inLanguage":"English","name":"The best movie critic is YOU","reviewBody":"So I suggest not writing this off as a Hollywood hack film, simply because it's the bandwagon thing to do. Before you go and see The Da Vinci Code, let all the negative and positive hype surrounding this production cancel each other out, clear your mind, and judge this film fairly. Do NOT judge it on its usually weak director, do NOT judge it entirely on the source material and do NOT judge it on your religious beliefs. All this will be rewarding.\n\nI have not read the book so I will not attempt any kind of comparison. \n\nPlot essentially goes like this: In the middle of the night, Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned as an expert to a crime scene in Le Louvre where a terrible murder has been committed. The victim's body is self-placed in such a bizarre, symbolic way next to one of the world's most famous paintings that the investigation gradually unlocks age-old mysteries that many do not wish to be unlocked.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code is a chilling, thrilling and well-sewn together mystery thriller that often keeps you on the edge of your seat. The cast do not disappoint either. Paul Bettany is genuinely creepy as Silas and thereby reinforces the stereotype that all albinos are evil. While Audrey Tatou is annoyingly frail as Sophie Neveu, she is captivating and lovely and is able to project both charisma and presence on screen in this film. However, Tom Hanks did not at all feel like the protagonist in the story and I am unaware whether that was intentional or not but I'm guessing no, in which case Hanks definitely fails in both attracting and keeping our interest.\n\nSo the cast usually perform well (with the exception of Hanks) and the story is also facilitated by some very striking visuals. A big plus for this film which elevates it slightly above generic formula is its beautiful locations often seen through epic aerial shots. Good call, Howard! Another big plus is its distinctly Euro-centric feel in both style and substance. This surprised me since it is Tom Hanks and Ron Howard in the same film, but they do manage to keep the overblown Hollywood clichés to a minimum. This is even apparent in the score by Hans Zimmer; it is not overblown, but subtle and appropriate in the scenes to which it was scored. Similarly, Frenchmen do not speak English with a French accent when they were alone together, but speak in French. That said, the plot does unfold in a somewhat Hollywood fashion -- and the plot happens to be thinner than an Olsen twin.\n\nTo counter the good parts, two big minuses in The Da Vinci Code are its wooden and sometimes even placeholder dialogue and its distinct lack of humor. I felt the actors were much too serious for this kind of film, which is first and foremost an adventure story, fast-paced and constantly unlocking new mysteries. The issues in the film were serious enough and needed more comedy to balance them.\n\nAs I write this review, more and more bad points about it spring to mind. This is strange, since I remember sitting in the cinema with my friends just a few hours ago and being thoroughly entertained and captivated by the whole thing. So, never mind the occasionally insultingly far-fetched plot and plot-twists by Dan Brown; The Da Vinci Code is a nicely done and very entertaining film in which nothing feels missing or incomplete.\n\n7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":418760,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-17","keywords":"self flagellation,conspiracy,bare butt male,self punishment,bound and gagged","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Da Vinci Code","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2369847833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Blu-Ray trailer for this conspiracy thriller starring Tom Hanks","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000606/","name":"Jean Reno"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000165/","name":"Ron Howard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0124737/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326040/","name":"Akiva Goldsman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1467010/","name":"Dan Brown"],"duration":"PT2H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Nakon što se deset godina klonila profesionalnog svijeta, Candice Renoir, plavuša i majka četvero djece, vrhovna je zapovjednica skupine istražitelja. Candice Renoir ima četvero djece, a nije radila deset godina kako bi pratila njezinog muža u inozemstvu. Sada rastavljena od muža, preuzima posao voditeljice istražnog tima javne sigurnosti na jugu Francuske. Na čelu ovog novog tima, ona mora dokazati da je dobra u svom poslu. Iskustvo, vještina promatranja , analitičke sposobnosti i oštroumnost pomažu joj u rješavanju istraga.</desc>

There are some strong emotions in the film, and Boyle's direction keeps the film dynamic and engaging.\n\nPrepare yourself to be overtaken by emotions as varied as joy, pity, happiness, anger, revulsion, surprise, and an exhilarating conclusion rarely seen in movies anymore. This film has made me grateful to be alive and that we still have people in cinema like Boyle who understands the power and beauty of the medium.

When they arrive their childhood play area - a boat that has gotten stuck in the trees during a storm - they discover an adult is now inhabiting it. Just at a time when they are beginning to recognize their own pre-adult urgings awakening inside them, they discover who is living in their tree house of sort and make friends with him. He becomes a mentor to them just when the murky waters have become too muddy to see clearly, and he tells them how his own life has been shipwrecked because of a love affair that began when he was about their age.\n\nThe man named Mud had fallen in love with a girl named Juniper when he was a kid and never recovered from the experience. Just as her name implies, she is a bittersweet, prickly creature whose fragrance has gotten into his nostrils and he thinks he can't live without her. On the other hand, she is fickle with love, not appreciating what he has to offer, and only accepting it when it's according to her whims. This mirrors the relationship that Ellis finds himself in with his "girlfriend," May Pearl.\n\nNeckbone, on the other hand, has never had anyone love him except for an uncle whose relationships with women are on his terms and usually consist of one night, or to be more exact, one afternoon, stands. On the other hand, his uncle knows how to find the pearls others don't see, and he has found one in the boy he calls Neckbone.\n\nEllis can't help comparing his father's relationship with his mother to his new friend, who will do anything to defend the honor of this woman, even if it means going to jail for the rest of his life, and his father is falling short in his estimation. On one hand, his father is telling him how bad women can be and on the other hand, he has this friend telling him that they are worth everything. This conflicts Ellis, and he finds himself in his own set of conflicts as he defends the girl in his life.\n\nMud's stories are larger than life, and one wonders what is real and what is not. Juniper calls him a liar, but is he really? By the conclusion, one begins to see that Mud's actions are not as murky as they at first seem. In the end, will the river of life lead them to larger horizons where they can grow from their experiences?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":175464,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-05-10","keywords":"southern gothic,river,friendship between boys,character name as title,lionsgate","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1899734553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMTY1MTYxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI3OTQ0OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMTY1MTYxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI3OTQ0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Two teenage boys encounter a fugitive and form a pact to help him evade the bounty hunters on his trail and to reunite him with his true love."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000190/","name":"Matthew McConaughey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4446467/","name":"Tye Sheridan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5015107/","name":"Jacob Lofland"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2158772/","name":"Jeff Nichols"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064141/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0360267/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2158772/","name":"Jeff Nichols"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When they arrive their childhood play area - a boat that has gotten stuck in the trees during a storm - they discover an adult is now inhabiting it. Just at a time when they are beginning to recognize their own pre-adult urgings awakening inside them, they discover who is living in their tree house of sort and make friends with him. He becomes a mentor to them just when the murky waters have become too muddy to see clearly, and he tells them how his own life has been shipwrecked because of a love affair that began when he was about their age.\n\nThe man named Mud had fallen in love with a girl named Juniper when he was a kid and never recovered from the experience. Just as her name implies, she is a bittersweet, prickly creature whose fragrance has gotten into his nostrils and he thinks he can't live without her. On the other hand, she is fickle with love, not appreciating what he has to offer, and only accepting it when it's according to her whims. This mirrors the relationship that Ellis finds himself in with his "girlfriend," May Pearl.\n\nNeckbone, on the other hand, has never had anyone love him except for an uncle whose relationships with women are on his terms and usually consist of one night, or to be more exact, one afternoon, stands. On the other hand, his uncle knows how to find the pearls others don't see, and he has found one in the boy he calls Neckbone.\n\nEllis can't help comparing his father's relationship with his mother to his new friend, who will do anything to defend the honor of this woman, even if it means going to jail for the rest of his life, and his father is falling short in his estimation. On one hand, his father is telling him how bad women can be and on the other hand, he has this friend telling him that they are worth everything. This conflicts Ellis, and he finds himself in his own set of conflicts as he defends the girl in his life.\n\nMud's stories are larger than life, and one wonders what is real and what is not. Juniper calls him a liar, but is he really? By the conclusion, one begins to see that Mud's actions are not as murky as they at first seem. In the end, will the river of life lead them to larger horizons where they can grow from their experiences?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":175464,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-05-10","keywords":"southern gothic,river,friendship between boys,character name as title,lionsgate","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1899734553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMTY1MTYxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI3OTQ0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMTY1MTYxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI3OTQ0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Two teenage boys encounter a fugitive and form a pact to help him evade the bounty hunters on his trail and to reunite him with his true love.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000190/","name":"Matthew McConaughey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4446467/","name":"Tye Sheridan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5015107/","name":"Jacob Lofland"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2158772/","name":"Jeff Nichols"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064141/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0360267/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2158772/","name":"Jeff Nichols"],"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When they arrive their childhood play area - a boat that has gotten stuck in the trees during a storm - they discover an adult is now inhabiting it. Just at a time when they are beginning to recognize their own pre-adult urgings awakening inside them, they discover who is living in their tree house of sort and make friends with him.

Just as her name implies, she is a bittersweet, prickly creature whose fragrance has gotten into his nostrils and he thinks he can't live without her.

On the other hand, his uncle knows how to find the pearls others don't see, and he has found one in the boy he calls Neckbone.\n\nEllis can't help comparing his father's relationship with his mother to his new friend, who will do anything to defend the honor of this woman, even if it means going to jail for the rest of his life, and his father is falling short in his estimation. On one hand, his father is telling him how bad women can be and on the other hand, he has this friend telling him that they are worth everything. This conflicts Ellis, and he finds himself in his own set of conflicts as he defends the girl in his life.\n\nMud's stories are larger than life, and one wonders what is real and what is not. Juniper calls him a liar, but is he really? By the conclusion, one begins to see that Mud's actions are not as murky as they at first seem.

Pong, the first commercially successful video game, came out in 1972 and became the inspiration for "Tron", the 1982 film in which a human being gets trapped inside a game (although one much more complex than Pong). The Tron movie spawned several video games, other entertainment products and a 2010 sequel. In the meantime, video games which became feature films (some live-action, some animated and some a combination of both) included "Super Mario Brothers" (1993), the "Mortal Combat" movies ('95 and '97), the "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" films (2001 and 2003), the "Resident Evil" series (2002-2017) and "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" (2010). More recent examples include the nostalgia-fueled films "Wreck-It Ralph" (2012) and "Pixels" (2015), not to mention 2016's animated fantasy epic "Warcraft".\n\nWith a "Lara Croft" reboot planned (starring Alicia Vikander), the cross-pollination between game consoles and movie theaters doesn't look to end any time soon, especially when you consider the new "Ratchet &amp; Clank" template. Croft's video game franchise got a reboot in 2013, followed by the reboot of her film franchise, both of which serve as prequels to the earlier versions of the game and the Angelina Jolie movies. Likewise, 2016's "Ratchet &amp; Clank" film is an origin story for the characters (whose first video game appeared in 2002), but this film was actually developed in conjunction with the video game reboot, which is based partially on the film, which had its original 2015 release date delayed, leading to a matching (coordinated) postponement in the release of the new game. Of course, all that is just background to a movie which, as a feature film, needs to stand on its own and entertain audiences whether they're gamers or think that "Ratchet &amp; Clank" is just a bad name for an auto repair shop.\n\nRatchet (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) is a Lombax, a cat-like creature with especially large ears and thick eyebrows. He's an earnest mechanic who works for Grimroth Razz (John Goodman) repairing and maintaining spaceships. Ratchet's a relatively small creature, but he has big dreams. He wants to join his heroes, the Galactic Rangers, fellow anthropomorphic animals who travel around the Solona Galaxy battling evildoers (kind of like an animated "Guardians of the Galaxy"). The Rangers' leader is Captain Qwark (Jim Ward) a large attention-seeking humanoid with a larger-than-life personality (think Buzz Lightyear on steroids) and ego to match. Ratchet is crushed when he responds to a Galaxy Rangers open try-out, only for his hero to tell him face-to-face that he doesn't have what it takes to be one of them.\n\nRatchet gets the opportunity to prove himself when he meets up with an undersized but sentient factory-rejected robot whom he calls Clank (David Kaye). Clank carries information about the evil Chairman Drek (Paul Giamatti), the leader of the Blarg, and his involvement in the recent destruction of several uninhabited planets. Working together, Ratchet and Clank are able to throw Drek's plans off track and prove themselves worthy of joining the Galactic Rangers. The adorable title characters work with Qwark, Cora (Bella Thorne), Brax (Vincent Tong), Elaris (Rosario Dawson) and others to keep Drek from meeting his increasingly dangerous goals. Meanwhile, Drek works with his robot henchman, Victor Von Ion (Sylvester Stallone), and his head scientist, Doctor Nefarious (Armin Shimerman) to infiltrate the Galactic Rangers and move forward with his plans, but Drek's not this story's only villain with a plan.\n\n"Ratchet &amp; Clank" is an entertaining and smart blending of various elements and characters from the video game series with a new origin story. Screenwriters T.J. Fixman, Gerry Swallow and Kevin Munroe (who also directs, along with Jericca Cleland) give us plenty of action and some good life lessons which parents will appreciate and will (hopefully) inspire kids, but the script is a short on laughs (including mature humor that pops up in the games). The voice work of the stars in the cast is predictably reliable, but can't outshine the relative unknowns (some of whom voiced the video game characters), proving that it's not necessary to stock every animated movie with big-name voice talent to create an entertaining product. This film's biggest strength is its creative and state-of-the-art animation.

Pong, the first commercially successful video game, came out in 1972 and became the inspiration for "Tron", the 1982 film in which a human being gets trapped inside a game (although one much more complex than Pong). The Tron movie spawned several video games, other entertainment products and a 2010 sequel. In the meantime, video games which became feature films (some live-action, some animated and some a combination of both) included "Super Mario Brothers" (1993), the "Mortal Combat" movies ('95 and '97), the "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" films (2001 and 2003), the "Resident Evil" series (2002-2017) and "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" (2010). More recent examples include the nostalgia-fueled films "Wreck-It Ralph" (2012) and "Pixels" (2015), not to mention 2016's animated fantasy epic "Warcraft".\n\nWith a "Lara Croft" reboot planned (starring Alicia Vikander), the cross-pollination between game consoles and movie theaters doesn't look to end any time soon, especially when you consider the new "Ratchet &amp; Clank" template. Croft's video game franchise got a reboot in 2013, followed by the reboot of her film franchise, both of which serve as prequels to the earlier versions of the game and the Angelina Jolie movies. Likewise, 2016's "Ratchet &amp; Clank" film is an origin story for the characters (whose first video game appeared in 2002), but this film was actually developed in conjunction with the video game reboot, which is based partially on the film, which had its original 2015 release date delayed, leading to a matching (coordinated) postponement in the release of the new game. Of course, all that is just background to a movie which, as a feature film, needs to stand on its own and entertain audiences whether they're gamers or think that "Ratchet &amp; Clank" is just a bad name for an auto repair shop.\n\nRatchet (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) is a Lombax, a cat-like creature with especially large ears and thick eyebrows. He's an earnest mechanic who works for Grimroth Razz (John Goodman) repairing and maintaining spaceships. Ratchet's a relatively small creature, but he has big dreams. He wants to join his heroes, the Galactic Rangers, fellow anthropomorphic animals who travel around the Solona Galaxy battling evildoers (kind of like an animated "Guardians of the Galaxy"). The Rangers' leader is Captain Qwark (Jim Ward) a large attention-seeking humanoid with a larger-than-life personality (think Buzz Lightyear on steroids) and ego to match. Ratchet is crushed when he responds to a Galaxy Rangers open try-out, only for his hero to tell him face-to-face that he doesn't have what it takes to be one of them.\n\nRatchet gets the opportunity to prove himself when he meets up with an undersized but sentient factory-rejected robot whom he calls Clank (David Kaye). Clank carries information about the evil Chairman Drek (Paul Giamatti), the leader of the Blarg, and his involvement in the recent destruction of several uninhabited planets. Working together, Ratchet and Clank are able to throw Drek's plans off track and prove themselves worthy of joining the Galactic Rangers. The adorable title characters work with Qwark, Cora (Bella Thorne), Brax (Vincent Tong), Elaris (Rosario Dawson) and others to keep Drek from meeting his increasingly dangerous goals. Meanwhile, Drek works with his robot henchman, Victor Von Ion (Sylvester Stallone), and his head scientist, Doctor Nefarious (Armin Shimerman) to infiltrate the Galactic Rangers and move forward with his plans, but Drek's not this story's only villain with a plan.\n\n"Ratchet &amp; Clank" is an entertaining and smart blending of various elements and characters from the video game series with a new origin story. Screenwriters T.J. Fixman, Gerry Swallow and Kevin Munroe (who also directs, along with Jericca Cleland) give us plenty of action and some good life lessons which parents will appreciate and will (hopefully) inspire kids, but the script is a short on laughs (including mature humor that pops up in the games). The voice work of the stars in the cast is predictably reliable, but can't outshine the relative unknowns (some of whom voiced the video game characters), proving that it's not necessary to stock every animated movie with big-name voice talent to create an entertaining product. This film's biggest strength is its creative and state-of-the-art animation. Even without viewing the film in 3D, we see remarkable detail and depth in its characters and backgrounds, giving the audience the impression that they already know what the objects and textures would feel like. This is one of those rare video game adaptations that's not only visually stunning, but entertaining AND family friendly.

First, his career as a folk singer  is going badly: his duet partner committed suicide, his record isn't  selling, he makes so little that he cannot afford his own apartment but  has to move from friend to friend, or rather from acquaintance to  acquaintance. Secondly, as far as human relationships are concerned, he  is a total failure. His ex girlfriend despises him, one of her  predecessors faked an abortion to have him out of her  and the mutual  child's life  people who are sympathetic to him, get a rather rude  treatment on a daily basis. After A Serious Man, the Coen brothers have  again chosen to depict a man on the wrong side of luck. Only this time,  one might say he deserves it.  Or maybe not, for he has one redeeming feature. The film opens with a  long scene in which Davis (Oscar Isaac) performs a sad old folk song.  The camera gently hovers around him, catches the hushed, intensely  attentive atmosphere of the smoky basement club, while he sucks his  audience  us  into the dark, sorrowful world he creates in his song,  hinting at a depth he so often will not show in "real life". It is this  contrast, the dialogue between the sadly funny tale of a modern Don  Quixote and that other, older, tenderer story, the music tells. For as  much as this is Llewyn's story, it also is that of the redeeming power  of music. For even if Davis is the same at the end as the story comes  full circle and returns to its opening, as he once again gets beaten up  and is succeeded on stage by a young, cocky folk singer with a nasal  voice who will soon change music  and not just folk music  forever,  there is just the tiniest hint that this Llewyn Davis might have some  sort of promise after all, maybe not as a successful singer, but as a  human being.  Inside Llewyn Davis is inspired loosely by the story of Dave van Ronk,  a star of the Greenwich Village folk scene around the time of Bob  Dylan's arrival there in 1961. Dylan learned a lot from van Ronk and  stole some of his most promising songs, but that is a story to be told  another day. This one is about a man lost in a world that hasn't been  waiting for him, who has a mission that is entirely his own. The  lengths to which he goes to show the world he doesn't care are  astounding. And yet he craves love. Oscar Isaac is a miracle: even in  his most repelling state, in his most rejecting attitude, there is a  flicker of sad longing in his face, his eyes, a face the Coens show us  much of. It is one you need to dive into, closed to the casual observer  but hiding so much pain and uncertainty and desire to live one  sometimes thinks it must explode. The Coens' cinema is one of subtlety,  of nuanced, of shades of grey between the black and white. In Isaac,  they have found their perfect actor, heading a stellar cast including  Carey Mulligan, John Goodman and Justin Timberlake.  As so often, the Coen brothers are masters at creating an atmosphere, a  universe of its own, unique as well as absolutely consistent. It is a  world of the night, in which grey shades reign, days are pale and dust  is everywhere. Even in the open there is a sense of narrowness, of  tight spaces, lightless basements that are cage and protective space in  one. It is the tiny holes that provide the only rooms for creativity,  for the soul to speak. And so it is that the dark world of the  underground gradually regains some warmth and coziness, the dark  becomes a zone of comfort, while everything else becomes cold and  distant.  Having said all this, Inside Llewyn Davis is first and foremost a  comedy in the Coenesque sense of the term. It is a Quixotic tale full  of quirky characters at time bordering on the fairy-tale like   especially true for the sequence around Goodman's character, a  trodden-down mixture of villain and clown that calls up associations of  the expressionist nightmare world of their earlier film Barton Fink.  The other foot of the film is firmly on the ground, in the existential  struggle of a man the world won't welcome. But there is still that  third element: music, that timeless realm of love and pain and  suffering and hope. It is here the film is anchored, it is here this  Don Quixote conquers his windmills, armed solely with his guitar. It is  here it all comes together. Tragedy, comedy, fairy tale, social drama,  held together by the softest of touches. Another Coen brothers  masterpiece.

First, his career as a folk singer  is going badly: his duet partner committed suicide, his record isn't  selling, he makes so little that he cannot afford his own apartment but  has to move from friend to friend, or rather from acquaintance to  acquaintance. Secondly, as far as human relationships are concerned, he  is a total failure. His ex girlfriend despises him, one of her  predecessors faked an abortion to have him out of her  and the mutual  child's life  people who are sympathetic to him, get a rather rude  treatment on a daily basis. After A Serious Man, the Coen brothers have  again chosen to depict a man on the wrong side of luck. Only this time,  one might say he deserves it.  Or maybe not, for he has one redeeming feature.

She somehow is also a sympathetic character, and is beautifully played by Jessie Buckley. You might need subtitles occasionally to catch the full Glaswegian abuse and humour she manages to spout out. Other standouts are her two little children - remarkable performances by both - and a pretty impressive bit of character acting by Julie Walters as her despairing mum - complete with what sounded a decent accent, if a Sassenach can judge that. As for the music and the plot.... it does the job but for me only occasionally hit the real emotional spot.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13036,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2019-04-12","keywords":"singer,country music singer,train,party,release from prison","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2535701529","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGYzMmUxM2MtMWZkYi00ZDk2LWFjN2YtMjI3ZDc1ZTVmMjc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGYzMmUxM2MtMWZkYi00ZDk2LWFjN2YtMjI3ZDc1ZTVmMjc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Fresh out of a stint in prison, Rose-Lynn is a single mom with an ankle monitor, a curfew, and a concerned mother (Julie Walters), who wants her to focus more on her two children and less on her music.

Santa Claus, as played as screen icon Mel Gibson, is not really "fat" as the title would imply, but Mel makes the character a badass. However, Chris has incurred the wrath of a thoroughly repugnant devil-child. Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield) is a rich 12 year old child whose nasty actions have motivated Chris to gift the kid with a lump of coal. But the kid retaliates by calling upon his favorite hitman (the great character actor Walton Goggins), and hiring him to assassinate Chris!\n\n"Fatman" was, for this viewer, an ingeniously twisted little tale that works hard to be edgy, and delivers some good dark comedy. Of course, it's far from being for all tastes, especially as we see that Billy is ready and willing to torture a schoolmate when she wins a science fair first prize that he feels should have been his. Fairly grim (but not overwhelmingly so), and very violent, the film also delivers some unexpected poignancy as Chris bemoans the state of the world today - and the bad attitudes of its children. Chris himself has fallen on such hard times that he enters into a temporary partnership with the U. S. military, where the elves will be making product other than toys.\n\nMel is in fine form, and he and the wonderful Marianne Jean-Baptiste make for a rather endearing Mr. And Mrs. Claus. Goggins is superb as the icy-cold, super-efficient hired killer who has his own reasons for wanting to bump off St. Nick. (One amusing character trait is that "Skinny Man"s' pet of choice is a hamster.) Young Hurstfield is very, very good at creating a child character so despicable that you hate him from the word go.\n\nIn general, whatever problems the movie has are made up for by the entertaining story that provides an off-the-beaten path experience for those viewers who may be tired of "feel good" fare.\n\nEight out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21757,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2020-11-17","keywords":"christmas,santa claus character,post office,assassin,elf","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi830914841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"To save his declining business, Chris Cringle (Mel Gibson), also known as Santa Claus, is forced into a partnership with the U.S. military.

Santa Claus, as played as screen icon Mel Gibson, is not really "fat" as the title would imply, but Mel makes the character a badass. However, Chris has incurred the wrath of a thoroughly repugnant devil-child. Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield) is a rich 12 year old child whose nasty actions have motivated Chris to gift the kid with a lump of coal. But the kid retaliates by calling upon his favorite hitman (the great character actor Walton Goggins), and hiring him to assassinate Chris!\n\n"Fatman" was, for this viewer, an ingeniously twisted little tale that works hard to be edgy, and delivers some good dark comedy. Of course, it's far from being for all tastes, especially as we see that Billy is ready and willing to torture a schoolmate when she wins a science fair first prize that he feels should have been his. Fairly grim (but not overwhelmingly so), and very violent, the film also delivers some unexpected poignancy as Chris bemoans the state of the world today - and the bad attitudes of its children. Chris himself has fallen on such hard times that he enters into a temporary partnership with the U. S. military, where the elves will be making product other than toys.\n\nMel is in fine form, and he and the wonderful Marianne Jean-Baptiste make for a rather endearing Mr. And Mrs. Claus. Goggins is superb as the icy-cold, super-efficient hired killer who has his own reasons for wanting to bump off St. Nick. (One amusing character trait is that "Skinny Man"s' pet of choice is a hamster.) Young Hurstfield is very, very good at creating a child character so despicable that you hate him from the word go.\n\nIn general, whatever problems the movie has are made up for by the entertaining story that provides an off-the-beaten path experience for those viewers who may be tired of "feel good" fare.\n\nEight out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21757,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2020-11-17","keywords":"christmas,santa claus character,post office,assassin,elf","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi830914841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA1NTNhMWMtYjEzYy00MjFkLThkM2ItYjAwZWMzMDgwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"To save his declining business, Chris Cringle (Mel Gibson), also known as Santa Claus, is forced into a partnership with the U.S. military.

However, halfway through the plot suddenly goes completely bonkers and I'm struggling to figure out if the plot goes bonkers in a positive or negative way.\n\nThis movie is based on the story of Peter Pan, except it focuses on Wendy. The story follows Wendy and her twin brothers, James and Douglas, as they hop onto a train and end up on a magic island where kids don't age. However, things begin to get serious when Wendy learns of an old man on the island.\n\nI mentioned how the film starts out lacking substance. This issue is mostly due to the pacing, which is probably my biggest issue with the film. The scene where the kids get onto the train to the island feels like it comes out of nowhere, despite the fact that there is some build up. And even though it's established that Wendy seeks adventure, I don't really get the impression that she is ok with running away. Her sudden fascination with the train is confusing and feels like a scene or two that would further establish her adventurous and reckless side has been removed. The middle of the movie also feels like certain scenes were cut off too soon. For example, when Wendy and her brothers run into Thomas, a kid from their town who ran away to the island when Wendy was a baby, they question why Thomas looks exactly the same as when he disappeared, and then the scene immediately ends. And after that scene, they rarely interact with Thomas and instantly go back to playing. It feets odd to me that the kids seem to forget about the fact that they just reunited with a missing kid from their town and he hasn't aged a day.\n\nWhile the first half of the film feels very light on action, there's a very sudden shift in tone that honestly, made me uncomfortable, but in a good way. From that point forward, the film is a significantly more enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, I have issues with the ending. Obviously, I can't go into specifics, but let's just say that the ending raises more questions than answers. I don't have a problem with ambiguous endings, but when you're more confused because of said ambiguity, then I take issue.\n\nI rate this film 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 15. It came out in theatres on February 28th and the film is now out on digital.\n\nReviewed by Calista B., KIDS FIRST!

The pacing moves at lightning speed, the dialogue is quick, clever and deeper than you first realise and the conflict is always multi-layered. This one is actually told in quite a unique way with a couple of characters going over events that have already happened and it works masterfully.

It's not that the other stuff he's doing is bad ('Swept Away' being an obvious exception), it's just that he is so damn good as this style of movie.

Julianne Moore is excellent and deserving of the acclaim she's received for this role, as well as Quaid in the supporting role. The thing I think most people missed (or haven't made much comment on) is that both Kathleen and Frank are victims of heart-felt emotions at a time when expressing them is unthinkable. They are equally challenged by simple and earnest desires to "fill the void" in their lives: Kathleen with her giant colorblind heart in a cold society of bigots and Frank in his corporate supremacy and his "It's a different kind of love, Charlie Brown" headache. One reviewer said Frank was abusive, closeted (sure, obviously, duh) and an alcoholic. I guess if you'd ever been through that type of situation you might be a bit more forgiving because it is hell and I came from the 50s so trust. Each of these obviously well-developed characters is simply doing the best they can in a world where their ground-breaking feelings are out of place. I loved it. I own it. And I, clearly, do not advise that slim minds or socially challenged people attempt it. However, if you can watch a movie and not be a judge, if you can accept things not from your time and not about you but about very, very grand new ideas, it's an extremely well-made, well-acted and accurate film. I personally forgot we had so much orange and green furniture.

Julianne Moore is excellent and deserving of the acclaim she's received for this role, as well as Quaid in the supporting role. The thing I think most people missed (or haven't made much comment on) is that both Kathleen and Frank are victims of heart-felt emotions at a time when expressing them is unthinkable. They are equally challenged by simple and earnest desires to "fill the void" in their lives: Kathleen with her giant colorblind heart in a cold society of bigots and Frank in his corporate supremacy and his "It's a different kind of love, Charlie Brown" headache. One reviewer said Frank was abusive, closeted (sure, obviously, duh) and an alcoholic. I guess if you'd ever been through that type of situation you might be a bit more forgiving because it is hell and I came from the 50s so trust. Each of these obviously well-developed characters is simply doing the best they can in a world where their ground-breaking feelings are out of place. I loved it. I own it. And I, clearly, do not advise that slim minds or socially challenged people attempt it. However, if you can watch a movie and not be a judge, if you can accept things not from your time and not about you but about very, very grand new ideas, it's an extremely well-made, well-acted and accurate film. I personally forgot we had so much orange and green furniture. And Moore is to be also commended on how well she wore those giant skirts :)","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45713,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-05-07","keywords":"gossip,homosexual,gay kiss,hate crime,domestic violence","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Far From Heaven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2359689497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEyMmEwOTUtOTk1Yi00YTU0LTg2YjktOTUzZTMwODJkOTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEyMmEwOTUtOTk1Yi00YTU0LTg2YjktOTUzZTMwODJkOTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Focus Features","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000598/","name":"Dennis Quaid","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0371660/","name":"Dennis Haysbert"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001331/","name":"Todd Haynes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042766/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001331/","name":"Todd Haynes"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

However, halfway through the plot suddenly goes completely bonkers and I'm struggling to figure out if the plot goes bonkers in a positive or negative way.\n\nThis movie is based on the story of Peter Pan, except it focuses on Wendy. The story follows Wendy and her twin brothers, James and Douglas, as they hop onto a train and end up on a magic island where kids don't age. However, things begin to get serious when Wendy learns of an old man on the island.\n\nI mentioned how the film starts out lacking substance. This issue is mostly due to the pacing, which is probably my biggest issue with the film. The scene where the kids get onto the train to the island feels like it comes out of nowhere, despite the fact that there is some build up. And even though it's established that Wendy seeks adventure, I don't really get the impression that she is ok with running away. Her sudden fascination with the train is confusing and feels like a scene or two that would further establish her adventurous and reckless side has been removed. The middle of the movie also feels like certain scenes were cut off too soon. For example, when Wendy and her brothers run into Thomas, a kid from their town who ran away to the island when Wendy was a baby, they question why Thomas looks exactly the same as when he disappeared, and then the scene immediately ends. And after that scene, they rarely interact with Thomas and instantly go back to playing. It feets odd to me that the kids seem to forget about the fact that they just reunited with a missing kid from their town and he hasn't aged a day.\n\nWhile the first half of the film feels very light on action, there's a very sudden shift in tone that honestly, made me uncomfortable, but in a good way. From that point forward, the film is a significantly more enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, I have issues with the ending. Obviously, I can't go into specifics, but let's just say that the ending raises more questions than answers. I don't have a problem with ambiguous endings, but when you're more confused because of said ambiguity, then I take issue.\n\nI rate this film 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 15. It came out in theatres on February 28th and the film is now out on digital.\n\nReviewed by Calista B., KIDS FIRST!

Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget the bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power to forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves.  At the very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again ("Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it"); at the worst, it eliminates the possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives and whose lives we shape through ours.\n\nThe film explores these ideas in a novel and engaging way: by taking the audience inside the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a man who, after breaking up with his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslett), discovers later that she has had her memory of him wiped clean from her mind.  He finds out how she had this procedure done and, despondent not only about the breakup but even more so about her having completely erased him from her mind, searches out the doctor who performed the procedure and signs up to have the same procedure done to him, so that he may also have no memory of her.  He is rendered unconscious for the procedure but his subconscious is still active.   Once the procedure is initiated and he becomes aware that his memories of the woman he loved - and still loves - are vanishing from his brain, he starts having second thoughts and wants the procedure stopped.  His challenge then becomes to figure out how to protect as much of his memory of her as he can, and to find a way stop the procedure despite the fact that he is in an unconscious state.\n\nThe manner in which he comes to realize and confront his dilemma is played out entirely within his interior landscape, a realm which (as anyone who remembers their dreams upon waking from sleep can attest) is a very surreal extension of our day-to-day experiences.  Michel Gondry's visual style and direction works exceptionally well here in conveying the slippery, chaotic unpredictability of the worlds we construct from our memories and experiences; the clever interplay between this interior world and the goings-on of the outside world helps keep the viewer off-balance just enough to illuminate the fuzzy line of demarcation separating the two worlds and the peculiar manner in which they play off one another.\n\nJim Carrey and Kate Winslett do an exceptional job of bringing this abstract story concept to life with characters that are endearing, poignant, believable and utterly human.  The supporting players are equally impressive: Tom Wilkinson as the mind-eraser doctor, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as the technicians, Kiersten Dunst as the receptionist all have relationships to the main protagonists and to one another that come to light as the story unfolds and help to propel the plot; as friends of Joel and Clementine, David Cross and Jane Adams are hilarious as a couple who seem to be stuck in the same rut that compelled the protagonists to break up and have each other erased from their respective minds.  Kaufman juggles all these relationships masterfully and in such a way as to ensure none of them are superfluous to the ideas he is trying to get across in this story.\n\nWhile there are elements of the plot that seem to place this movie in the realm of science fiction, the focus of the movie stays on the interior states, emotions and relationships between the characters.  As such, the film is more of a romantic comedy than anything - albeit unlike any other romantic comedy you're ever likely to see.  I saw a late showing of this movie with my girlfriend the day it was released at a local multiplex and there were only 20 or so people in the theater, yet at the film's conclusion everyone broke out in a spontaneous round of applause.  This gives an idea of how compelling this movie can be.  If you give this film a chance to creep under your skin, you will likely find yourself reflexively thinking about your feelings toward the important people in your life, as well how you relate to those feelings, as well as your memories and how you relate to them.  A thought provoking, moving and entertaining film - I can imagine that a working title of this film might have been "Warts And All.""},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":959436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-03-19","keywords":"memory,loneliness,valentine's day,flashback,nonlinear timeline","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2292515097","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA4YjQ5ZjEtMGQ4Mi00NWExLTkxMGQtNzAwYzVmNTU1ODJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA4YjQ5ZjEtMGQ4Mi00NWExLTkxMGQtNzAwYzVmNTU1ODJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000120/","name":"Jim Carrey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0929489/","name":"Tom Wilkinson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0327273/","name":"Michel Gondry"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017525/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017713/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0442109/","name":"Charlie Kaufman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0327273/","name":"Michel Gondry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1410028/","name":"Pierre Bismuth"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It also informs me that Emmerich, taking advantage of the money he made on the previous films, paid for this whole movie out of his own pocket, so that he could have full control of the film, without interference from any studio. It shows.\n\nIt's not a bad movie at all. And this is something I never thought I'd find myself saying about a Roland Emmerich movie. The cast is simply to die for: Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth the elder; her daughter Joely Richardson as Elizabeth the younger; Rafe Spall as Shakespeare (a talentless clod of an actor); Sebastian Arnesto as Ben Johnson (a talented playwright, but not even in the same galaxy of greatness as the author of Shakespeare's plays); David Thewlis as William Cecil; Edward Hogg as Robert Cecil; Derek Jacobi doing the prologue; Jaime Campbell Bower (from "Camelot") as the younger Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford; and Rhys Ifans as the older Edward de Vere, and the real author of Shakespeare's work.\n\nAs presented, the plot is not at all a scholarly argument for the Earl of Oxford's authorship of these plays. It is instead a clever reimagining of historical events (some treated as loosely as Shakespeare himself treated actual history) to turn the answer to the mystery that scholars argue about into a taut political thriller. In Orloff's/Emmerich's vision, Edward de Vere wrote the plays and published them under someone else's name for no less a reason that to foment revolution, change the course of history, and determine the next king of England.\n\nAnd damnit, that reimagining kinda worked for me. The sets and costumes are pitch perfect, the performances are good, and the potential is there for a good time to be had by all.

Orloff really did his research. Except for the part about Edward de Vere having died before at least 10 of Shakespeare's plays were written, that is. But that's just a nitpick, and should not stand in the way of writing a good drama. Those kinds of historical nitpicks did not deter Shakespeare, and they don't deter Orloff and Emmerich.

After Mildred Haynes buys three billboards with words written on them accusing the town's well-liked sheriff of having not found her daughter's killer, it sets a series of events that turns the citizens and the cops against her.\n\nThe thing I can say about Three Billboards without going into spoilers is that it is wildly unpredictable. One moment you think things are going one direction as expected then it takes hard left turn that only adds to the dynamic between the characters. As the pressure within the town builds and anger is pointed towards Mildred, we see many of these characters evolve in order to deal with tragedy and grief and learn to find peace. And the movie goes through a roller-coaster of emotions. One moment you are laughing your butt off from the hilarious dialogue then you feel like someone just punched you in the gut. With every victory you think this story brings you feel like it was taken away from because of the world's unfairness and injustice. In lesser hands the mixture of dark and comedic tones would not work, but director and writer Martin McDonagh knows how to balance them to perfection.\n\nThe performances here just through the roof. Frances McDormand delivers a performance that will for sure get her into the Lead Actress awards race at the Oscars. As Mildred, McDormand just cuts loose with her performance with every line of hate, cynicism and cursing towards everyone she feels doesn't truly understand the internal pain she is going through. But McDormand does now and then show a soft side to Mildred. It shows that Mildred is just person like everyone who has her own way of dealing with the tragedy of loosing her own child. And Sam Rockwell also gives one of the best performances of his career as the flawed and very misguided cop Dixon. The character of Dixon is short-tempered, volatile, and not bright with some baggage of his own that the locals accuse him of. But Sam Rockwell brings his charm and sincerity to what could be a rather unlikable character. And in the latter half, you see Dixon go through a tremendous arc of learning to care about others rather then just being angry towards them. Other great performances that should be called out are Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, John Hawk and Caleb Landry Jones.\n\nThree Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best movies this year and is worth seeing once it comes out in wide releases.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":474830,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-12-01","keywords":"billboard,police brutality,black comedy,ambiguous ending,thrown through a window","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3585980441","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUxMzJjNDEtNzI3MS00OWFkLTliZjYtYjc3ZTZiMDc2YWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQ0MDUyMzg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUxMzJjNDEtNzI3MS00OWFkLTliZjYtYjc3ZTZiMDc2YWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQ0MDUyMzg@._V1_.jpg","description":"In this darkly comic drama, a mother personally challenges the local authorities to solve her daughter's murder, when they fail to catch the culprit."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000531/","name":"Frances McDormand"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1732981/","name":"Martin McDonagh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010002/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0476818/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1732981/","name":"Martin McDonagh"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After Mildred Haynes buys three billboards with words written on them accusing the town's well-liked sheriff of having not found her daughter's killer, it sets a series of events that turns the citizens and the cops against her.\n\nThe thing I can say about Three Billboards without going into spoilers is that it is wildly unpredictable. One moment you think things are going one direction as expected then it takes hard left turn that only adds to the dynamic between the characters. As the pressure within the town builds and anger is pointed towards Mildred, we see many of these characters evolve in order to deal with tragedy and grief and learn to find peace. And the movie goes through a roller-coaster of emotions. One moment you are laughing your butt off from the hilarious dialogue then you feel like someone just punched you in the gut. With every victory you think this story brings you feel like it was taken away from because of the world's unfairness and injustice. In lesser hands the mixture of dark and comedic tones would not work, but director and writer Martin McDonagh knows how to balance them to perfection.\n\nThe performances here just through the roof. Frances McDormand delivers a performance that will for sure get her into the Lead Actress awards race at the Oscars. As Mildred, McDormand just cuts loose with her performance with every line of hate, cynicism and cursing towards everyone she feels doesn't truly understand the internal pain she is going through. But McDormand does now and then show a soft side to Mildred. It shows that Mildred is just person like everyone who has her own way of dealing with the tragedy of loosing her own child. And Sam Rockwell also gives one of the best performances of his career as the flawed and very misguided cop Dixon. The character of Dixon is short-tempered, volatile, and not bright with some baggage of his own that the locals accuse him of. But Sam Rockwell brings his charm and sincerity to what could be a rather unlikable character. And in the latter half, you see Dixon go through a tremendous arc of learning to care about others rather then just being angry towards them. Other great performances that should be called out are Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, John Hawk and Caleb Landry Jones.\n\nThree Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best movies this year and is worth seeing once it comes out in wide releases.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":474830,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-12-01","keywords":"billboard,police brutality,black comedy,ambiguous ending,thrown through a window","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3585980441","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUxMzJjNDEtNzI3MS00OWFkLTliZjYtYjc3ZTZiMDc2YWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQ0MDUyMzg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUxMzJjNDEtNzI3MS00OWFkLTliZjYtYjc3ZTZiMDc2YWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQ0MDUyMzg@._V1_.jpg","description":"In this darkly comic drama, a mother personally challenges the local authorities to solve her daughter's murder, when they fail to catch the culprit.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000531/","name":"Frances McDormand","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1732981/","name":"Martin McDonagh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010002/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0476818/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1732981/","name":"Martin McDonagh"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I mean, I had decent hopes for it. Leading up to it, so many people seemed to be taking it way to seriously. I mean, come on. Its about giant talking turtles who fight crime. Its not supposed to be that serious. Hoo, boy.\n\nI guess I'll just start by saying this (spoilers ahead), the changes they made to the origin story don't make any goddamn sense, both in terms of simple logic and quality narrative structure. They completely removed any connection between Splinter and the Shredder, so say goodbye to any emotional connection or tension that that would have brought. And this version Splinter wasn't the ninja master, Hamato Yoshi or even a pet/student of Yoshi. In fact, Yoshi seems to have been omitted completely. So, how does Splinter become a ninja master himself? He reads a book. I'm not even joking. After both he and the turtles mutate he finds a book and teaches himself. And it wasn't even at the very beginning. I mean when Splinter begin teaching himself, the turtles are already walking and talking. He not only learned all of ninjitsu but also somehow mastered it, without any instruction or sparring, in less than ten years? AND he taught it to the turtles? BULLSHIT.\n\nThe turtles themselves are one of the few not-terrible parts of the movie. All of there individual personalities are right where they should be but we are also kind of short-changed on the amount of interaction they have with each other. A bunch of brothers together, getting up to shenanigans? What a great, natural way to have conflict! But no, the movie follows April way too much.\n\nAll of that is indicative of a larger problem with the writing. Both of the villains are BORING. The pacing is uneven and a lot of the dialogue is forced and ham-handed, Michelangelo was the worse in that respect. And believe me, I get it. Mikey is the loud mouth, party turtle. But is is possible (kind of necessary) that if a main character is annoying, to also be likable. Yes, it possible. Severus Snape. Perry Cox. Deadpool. These are all characters that are bad or annoying people but still likable as characters. After a few minutes of listening to Michelangelo, I just wanted him to shut the hell up. \n\nIt doesn't get any better with the villains. I don't remember the last time I watched a movie with such boring villains. Instead of just sticking with one main villain, the Shredder, we now have two...for some reason. WE have Eric Sachs, who is a rich scientist/industrialist and the Shredder, an evil ninja master with no personality. Eric Sachs is working for the Shredder for money? But isn't he already like a billionaire with a castle on a mountain and his own skyscraper?Doe he need more money? What the hell for? Shredder is the most shallow and one-dimensional out of this whole damn movie. We're not really told anything of his back story or shown any of his motivation for anything. The foot clan is also no longer a group of ninja warriors, they're...guys with guns. Completely useless guys with guns (that'll be relevant later).\n\nThey also unnecessarily tie April, Sachs and April's dad into the turtles' back story...for some reason. We don't even really meet April's father. And April is the one who saved them from the lab fire that killed her father...or wait, was it Eric who killed her father? The movie seems to confused on that point. And instead of keeping the baby turtles (like any little girl who likes animals would do) she...dumps them in the sewer? What the hell? The who thing is convoluted and doesn't make any damn sense.\n\nApril O'Neil is uninteresting and stupid. Seriously, I mean she is unintelligent. She is supposedly an educated journalist but spends so much time trying to convince he boss of a "story" of talking, crime- fighting turtles without one single goddamn lick of evidence. Vernon Fenway is apparently supposed to be the comic relief but none of his jokes are funny and his sole role in the film seems to be driving April around. And why the hell is Whoopi Goldberg in this? She had like six lines. Why is she here?\n\nThe camera-work was clichéd and chaotic. There were times when the camera was moving around too much for you to easily follow the action. There is also a serious lack of cool martial arts fights for a NINJA Turtles movie, which is not surprising when you turn their main antagonists from ninja into guys with guns. I also couldn't even begin to take the Shredder serious in the action scenes. Are those giant swiss army knives on his hands? What the hell?\n\nFinally, the one thing, in my opinion, that sort of breaks the movie the most is that they made the turtles too damn powerful. Yes, the turtles are kind of superheroes. But wasn't being a bunch of kick-ass ninjas enough? No? You gotta give them super strength too? AND MAKE THEM BULLET PROOF!? Remember the previously said bit about the foot being a bunch of guys with guns? Yeah...you might see where I am going with this. It was bad enough to see the turtles throwing cars around and shattering concrete with punches. On some level, the audience needs to believe on some sort of fundamental level that the heroes are danger, that the threats that they face have meaning. Without that, there is no tension, no real conflict and with that...no excitement. No story.\n\nThis movie nuked the fridge.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":206328,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-09-03","keywords":"turtle,ninja,sewer,mutant,18 wheeler","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi295480345","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjczMjQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM3NjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjczMjQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM3NjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Darkness has settled over New York City as Shredder and his evil Foot Clan have an iron grip on everything from the police to the politicians.

Certainly if you want to avoid a very loud and very angry fan backlash. Go back to the comics and give the fans what they want. In the case of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, that's not really the case.\n\nThere are a good few of us who really love those original Mirage comic books, but a larger group of Turtles fans want an adaptation of the vastly different cartoon series from the 1980s. They want characters like Krang and Bebop and Rocksteady. As illogical as it might sound, you have to make a faithful adaptation of an unfaithful adaptation. And that's exactly what director David Green and his Turtles team have done for this new movie sequel.\n\nFollowing the events of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014), the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles continue to live in the shadows, bound to their underground lair by day, moving in the shadows at night, hiding from the very people of the city they risked their lives to save. Following the Turtles' failure to thwart a daring jailbreak, Shredder is on the loose again, this time with new allies. The Turtles must once again stop the villainous Shredder to protect the city, and the world, that don't know they exist from a new intergalactic threat.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out Of The Shadows is a massive upgrade from the first film. There are so many improvements. The Turtles' appearances; sized down a bit and given a few cartoonish adjustments, they look so much better (Splinter, voiced by Tony Shalhoub, is also given just minor alterations but looks greatly improved). The film has more action sequences, and they're bigger and better. It has a better script. It has a better story. The score is better.\n\nThe Turtles get more screen time (a concern of expense in the first film; perhaps the budget has been upgraded too), which is a massive boost. Building on one of the successes of the first film, the character work here is great. These are good versions of the Turtles. Michelangelo, played by the brilliant Noel Fisher, is dead funny. Jeremy Howard got Donatello bang on in the first film and here, given more to do, he impresses again. Raphael is not only helped by some adjustments to his face, but he's given some comedy in this sequel and it warms you up to Alan Ritchson's gruff would-be action hero a treat.\n\nThe stand out Turtle performance, though, is Pete Ploszek's Leonardo. Pete just is Leo. This film does right by the Turtles. We get to spend time in the lair with them just being the Turtles. This is a lesson learned in the first film; when your characters are good, let us watch them.

Will Arnett wrings laughs out of every moment of screen time he's given as cowardly cameraman Vernon Fenwick and David Green's film wisely puts him to work. I know you're not supposed to praise Megan Fox on the internet but I like her April O'Neil. Fox is surrounded by large characters with big personalities yet her April never looks like she can't hold her own.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out Of The Shadows is a good looking movie. Every set is stylish and filled with detail. It's colorful and full of cool vehicles and character designs. The bright colors and pristine look compliment to the cartoonish feel of the film and characters.\n\nA couple of the action sequences don't meet the standard set by the others. The film opens on a fairly disorienting one and a Casey Jones fight sequence doesn't seem to have been put together quite right. For the most part, though, the action set pieces are terrific. They're big, exciting and filled with character. The plane sequence in particular is very entertaining.\n\nThe obvious highlight, the stand out by a mile, better than everything else on screen, of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out Of The Shadows is the bungling duo of Bebop and Rocksteady. They don't so much light up the screen as come crashing through it, high fiving each other and destroying the front few rows of seats in the cinema. \n\nThe pair steal every scene they're in thanks to an alignment of excellent writing, top notch CGI and pitch perfect casting. The chemistry between actors Gary Anthony Williams, who plays Bebop, and Stephen 'Sheamus' Farrelly, who plays Rocksteady, contributes massively to a wonderfully funny screen team.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89469,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-06-29","keywords":"sequel,turtle,based on cartoon,rat,brother brother relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2458694681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NTE2NjcwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1NDA4ODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NTE2NjcwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1NDA4ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Meet the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they return to save the city from a dangerous threat."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1083271/","name":"Megan Fox"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1347153/","name":"Tyler Perry"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1757777/","name":"Dave Green"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015592/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0032227/","name":"Josh Appelbaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0625858/","name":"André Nemec"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0481990/","name":"Peter Laird"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Certainly if you want to avoid a very loud and very angry fan backlash. Go back to the comics and give the fans what they want. In the case of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, that's not really the case.\n\nThere are a good few of us who really love those original Mirage comic books, but a larger group of Turtles fans want an adaptation of the vastly different cartoon series from the 1980s. They want characters like Krang and Bebop and Rocksteady. As illogical as it might sound, you have to make a faithful adaptation of an unfaithful adaptation. And that's exactly what director David Green and his Turtles team have done for this new movie sequel.\n\nFollowing the events of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014), the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles continue to live in the shadows, bound to their underground lair by day, moving in the shadows at night, hiding from the very people of the city they risked their lives to save. Following the Turtles' failure to thwart a daring jailbreak, Shredder is on the loose again, this time with new allies. The Turtles must once again stop the villainous Shredder to protect the city, and the world, that don't know they exist from a new intergalactic threat.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out Of The Shadows is a massive upgrade from the first film. There are so many improvements. The Turtles' appearances; sized down a bit and given a few cartoonish adjustments, they look so much better (Splinter, voiced by Tony Shalhoub, is also given just minor alterations but looks greatly improved). The film has more action sequences, and they're bigger and better. It has a better script. It has a better story. The score is better.\n\nThe Turtles get more screen time (a concern of expense in the first film; perhaps the budget has been upgraded too), which is a massive boost. Building on one of the successes of the first film, the character work here is great. These are good versions of the Turtles. Michelangelo, played by the brilliant Noel Fisher, is dead funny. Jeremy Howard got Donatello bang on in the first film and here, given more to do, he impresses again. Raphael is not only helped by some adjustments to his face, but he's given some comedy in this sequel and it warms you up to Alan Ritchson's gruff would-be action hero a treat.\n\nThe stand out Turtle performance, though, is Pete Ploszek's Leonardo. Pete just is Leo. This film does right by the Turtles. We get to spend time in the lair with them just being the Turtles. This is a lesson learned in the first film; when your characters are good, let us watch them. The Turtles each get character moments and proper, set up and paid off story arcs.\n\nStephen Amell's Casey Jones does a bit too much telling instead of showing (he tells us he's crazy but there aren't too many moments on screen to back up his claim, for example), but Amell's performance is likable, energetic and kind of wired; it works. Will Arnett wrings laughs out of every moment of screen time he's given as cowardly cameraman Vernon Fenwick and David Green's film wisely puts him to work.

The comparison to Beauty and the Beast is understandable, but not quite accurate. The idea of social injustice and how immigrants are treated hits closer to home, and for those looking for a hidden message, sure why not. But what happened to just good old fashion storytelling? Do we really need an angle, or a strong political message? \n\nThe Shape of Water spins a beautiful yarn of two characters in love. Is it forbidden love? Of course. But more importantly it's the kind of love where these two only exist for each other. The film's closing narrative of a poem does an excellent job of explaining "The Shape of Water", which is the expression and theme of their love in the story. Michael Shannon continues to be the consummate bad guy, while Sally Hawkins tip toes into the unknown for quite a strange role. Substance is lacking nowadays in most movies so it's no wonder why it took home the Oscar.

The comparison to Beauty and the Beast is understandable, but not quite accurate. The idea of social injustice and how immigrants are treated hits closer to home, and for those looking for a hidden message, sure why not. But what happened to just good old fashion storytelling? Do we really need an angle, or a strong political message? \n\nThe Shape of Water spins a beautiful yarn of two characters in love. Is it forbidden love? Of course. But more importantly it's the kind of love where these two only exist for each other. The film's closing narrative of a poem does an excellent job of explaining "The Shape of Water", which is the expression and theme of their love in the story. Michael Shannon continues to be the consummate bad guy, while Sally Hawkins tip toes into the unknown for quite a strange role. Substance is lacking nowadays in most movies so it's no wonder why it took home the Oscar. Watch this film for a good story that moves well, and delivers in the end.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":398795,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2017-12-08","keywords":"underwater scene,mute woman,creature,interspecies romance,sign language","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4105025561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThkYTY1MzktN2E5OC00NzkxLWIwOTgtZDA1OTYzMzVlMTA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThkYTY1MzktN2E5OC00NzkxLWIwOTgtZDA1OTYzMzVlMTA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An other-worldly fairy tale, set against the backdrop of Cold War era America circa 1962.

It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.\n\nIt's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).\n\nThe Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.\n\nIn a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.\n\nBridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice ("Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.\n\nTwo little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.\n\nAside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":301757,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"lawyer,negotiation,cold war,spy,berlin wall","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Standing Man" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi303870745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4131020/","name":"Matt Charman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"duration":"PT2H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Upon completing his therapy for his injury, Ryan was conscripted by Thomas Harper to be an operative of the CIA because of his keen analytic acumen specifically in economics and finance. \n\n10 years later, while working in Wall Street, Ryan uncovers some suspicious transactions by a Russian firm which may spell economic disaster Stateside. Ryan goes to Moscow supposedly to do some auditing work. But upon his arrival, it was apparent that this mission was not only going to be about punching numbers into a computer.\n\nBecause of his previous work in "This is War", I knew Chris Pine could play a very good spy. Though Pine did not really look like he had a PhD degree, and a lot of his financial talk just flew over my head, his action sequences were very gritty and exhilarating. He also has great chemistry Keira Knightley, the actress who plays Ryan's charming fiancé Dr. Cathy Muller. Her suspicions of an affair unexpectedly gets her involved with Ryan's dangerous mission.\n\nIt was good to see Kevin Costner back on screen in a substantial role again. He was older of course, but still looking good. His character Harper may feel like any other mentor/supervisor role in other espionage films, but Costner played him very well. Too bad he was not really given any special moment which can be considered really memorable.\n\nThe villain of the film Viktor Cherevin though was another matter altogether. Kenneth Branagh creates a strong antagonist with his subtly sinister portrayal of the Russian businessman with terrorism, economic and otherwise, on his mind. He completely transformed into his role very convincingly, with no trace of British-ness.\n\nThis particular Jack Ryan did not feel like this was going to be the same man in the other older films where we knew the character Jack Ryan first, like "Hunt for Red October" (played by Alec Baldwin), "Patriot Games" and "Clear and Present Danger" (played by Harrison Ford) or even "Sum of All Fears" (played by Ben Affleck). This film only has the character Jack Ryan, but in a story NOT written by the books' author Tom Clancy at all.\n\nThis film had an oddly generic feel like we have seen this story in some form before. Even if this was set several years post-9/11, it had that dated Cold War (a la classic James Bond) feel especially when the action shifted to Moscow. Fortunately though, despite those gripes, "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit" is still a very exciting action-packed thriller. \n\nThe director is also Kenneth Branagh, whom we usually associate with Shakespearian productions.

 --- Description: Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit: Directed by Kenneth Branagh. With Chris Pine, Keira Knightley, Kevin Costner, Kenneth Branagh. Jack Ryan, as a young covert C.I.A. analyst, uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U.S. economy with a terrorist attack." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1205537/","name":"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MDkxNzYwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM2MjE5MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Jack Ryan, as a young covert C.I.A. analyst, uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U.S. economy with a terrorist attack.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1205537/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"3xHCCH","dateCreated":"2014-01-15","inLanguage":"English","name":"Oddly Familiar, Yet Still Very Exciting Thriller","reviewBody":"Jack Ryan was a young Marine who was injured during a mission when his helicopter crashed. Upon completing his therapy for his injury, Ryan was conscripted by Thomas Harper to be an operative of the CIA because of his keen analytic acumen specifically in economics and finance. \n\n10 years later, while working in Wall Street, Ryan uncovers some suspicious transactions by a Russian firm which may spell economic disaster Stateside. Ryan goes to Moscow supposedly to do some auditing work. But upon his arrival, it was apparent that this mission was not only going to be about punching numbers into a computer.\n\nBecause of his previous work in "This is War", I knew Chris Pine could play a very good spy. Though Pine did not really look like he had a PhD degree, and a lot of his financial talk just flew over my head, his action sequences were very gritty and exhilarating. He also has great chemistry Keira Knightley, the actress who plays Ryan's charming fiancé Dr. Cathy Muller. Her suspicions of an affair unexpectedly gets her involved with Ryan's dangerous mission.\n\nIt was good to see Kevin Costner back on screen in a substantial role again. He was older of course, but still looking good. His character Harper may feel like any other mentor/supervisor role in other espionage films, but Costner played him very well. Too bad he was not really given any special moment which can be considered really memorable.\n\nThe villain of the film Viktor Cherevin though was another matter altogether. Kenneth Branagh creates a strong antagonist with his subtly sinister portrayal of the Russian businessman with terrorism, economic and otherwise, on his mind. He completely transformed into his role very convincingly, with no trace of British-ness.\n\nThis particular Jack Ryan did not feel like this was going to be the same man in the other older films where we knew the character Jack Ryan first, like "Hunt for Red October" (played by Alec Baldwin), "Patriot Games" and "Clear and Present Danger" (played by Harrison Ford) or even "Sum of All Fears" (played by Ben Affleck). This film only has the character Jack Ryan, but in a story NOT written by the books' author Tom Clancy at all.\n\nThis film had an oddly generic feel like we have seen this story in some form before. Even if this was set several years post-9/11, it had that dated Cold War (a la classic James Bond) feel especially when the action shifted to Moscow. Fortunately though, despite those gripes, "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit" is still a very exciting action-packed thriller. \n\nThe director is also Kenneth Branagh, whom we usually associate with Shakespearian productions. He follows up his mainstream directorial work on the first "Thor" film with this one, with much skill. The camera work was excellent especially for the gunfights and car chases. That sequence of firm infiltration was very astutely edited with much tension, impossible as that could have been in real life. \n\nIt was Branagh's energetic story-telling and Pine's charismatic portrayal as Ryan that turned the potentially mediocre script around and created a really effective and entertaining spy thriller, successfully rebooting the character for a possible film franchise. 7/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":128580,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-01-22","keywords":"jack ryan character,russian,marine,u.s. marine,terrorist plot","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3398346777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2NTM1OTI3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODczNzM0MDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2NTM1OTI3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODczNzM0MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Jack Ryan, as a young covert CIA analyst, uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U.S. economy with a terrorist attack.

Watching it made me read extensively about the War of the Roses and Henry VII as king. Historically, as the series states, has been changed for dramatic purposes which is a bit of a shame because history itself is very interesting.

They are two extraordinary detective shows, which I strongly recommend.\n\nSo I gave Endeavour a try, both with curiosity and with fear that the experience would ruin my memories of the two shows I liked so much.\n\nAlso, Shaun Evans is physically very different from John Thaw, so this made me cringe even before the start.\n\nHaving said this, I fell for it from the very first episode.\n\nI was surprised to find out that Shaun Evans is a terrific actor, who plays an entirely credible Morse, if not physically, in a seamless psychological continuity which makes you feel the smooth way in which this young Morse would become the older Morse 20 years later, the incipient causticity, the noticeable anger, the budding low-key self-confidence--- This is very skillfully done in the prequel.\n\nBoth Thaw and Evans play the magic of giving a sexy twist to an unsexy character, without flashing the sexy card or even circumventing all attempts to look hot.\n\nAllum plays a marvelous D.C.

They are two extraordinary detective shows, which I strongly recommend.\n\nSo I gave Endeavour a try, both with curiosity and with fear that the experience would ruin my memories of the two shows I liked so much.\n\nAlso, Shaun Evans is physically very different from John Thaw, so this made me cringe even before the start.\n\nHaving said this, I fell for it from the very first episode.\n\nI was surprised to find out that Shaun Evans is a terrific actor, who plays an entirely credible Morse, if not physically, in a seamless psychological continuity which makes you feel the smooth way in which this young Morse would become the older Morse 20 years later, the incipient causticity, the noticeable anger, the budding low-key self-confidence--- This is very skillfully done in the prequel.\n\nBoth Thaw and Evans play the magic of giving a sexy twist to an unsexy character, without flashing the sexy card or even circumventing all attempts to look hot.\n\nAllum plays a marvelous D.C. Thursday and the interaction between them, mentor-pupil, is instrumental to explain how this young Morse ends up being that later Morse.\n\nThe 60's atmosphere is a plus in the show, very well portrayed and recreated. I'd say that the linking common trait between Morse, Endeavour and Lewis is, yes, their tremendous atmospheric virtue which sets you right on «in that particular place in that particular time».\n\nIf you like detective stories, you will not be disappointed at all, and even if you are not a Morse or Lewis fan, you will find this show entertaining, alluring and deeply satisfactory by its own right.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22854,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Watching it made me read extensively about the War of the Roses and Henry VII as king. Historically, as the series states, has been changed for dramatic purposes which is a bit of a shame because history itself is very interesting. Some of the dramatizations make relative sense, while other alterations simply are unneeded. I won't give specifics so as to give spoilers, and the internet makes it easy enough to research the accurate stories. The sets, costumes, and acting are all excellent.

Watching it made me read extensively about the War of the Roses and Henry VII as king. Historically, as the series states, has been changed for dramatic purposes which is a bit of a shame because history itself is very interesting. Some of the dramatizations make relative sense, while other alterations simply are unneeded. I won't give specifics so as to give spoilers, and the internet makes it easy enough to research the accurate stories. The sets, costumes, and acting are all excellent. So just accept that extensive liberties are taken, and enjoy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10943,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"2017-04-06","keywords":"1500s,war of the roses,costume drama,royalty,court intrigue","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3069650/","name":"Jodie Comer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5039410/","name":"Rebecca Benson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4753860/","name":"Jacob Collins-Levy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103820/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0361727/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000869/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The White Princess Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi323466777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzYzQ2ZDctZWU0Mi00YjcwLTg5OTMtNDg2MjNmN2I0NzE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5Mjg0NjU@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzYzQ2ZDctZWU0Mi00YjcwLTg5OTMtNDg2MjNmN2I0NzE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5Mjg0NjU@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Not only is it original and exciting, but the acting is top shelf as well. The producers and the people from casting, most famously represented by Jerry Bruckheimer, really did a great job in bringing together a perfect team of actors. The two most famous to me were Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows) and Paul Guilfoyle (Jim Brass) who have had a couple of minor roles in some films I saw. The rest of the crew are William L.Petersen (Gil Grissom), Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle), Gary Dourdan (Warrick Brown) and George Earls (Nick Stokes)\n\n The main characters from CSI, although flawed, like all human beings, are all likeable in their own way, including Greg Sanders (portrayed by Eric Szmanda). Despite the fact that all of the characters like their work and seem a bit obsessed by it, all characters are unique. Grissom is the wise, well educated loner, who seems to be the tough yet soft mentor to the rest of the crew. He likes to play with bugs and at times he seems not to forget what it means to be social. Sidle portrays some kind of a younger version of Grissom. She is eager to be the best, dedicated to her work night and day and quite the loner as well. Willows plays the modern woman. Dedicated to her work, but also a mother, which seems hard to balance at times. Warrick and Stokes are the manly men in the series, always competing to prove themselves and showing the other one who is the best.\n\n The characterizations of the persons portrayed along with everyones way of conduct and the great stories provide and interesting, humane and charming show, to be enjoyed by many people for a long time (I hope).

From what I saw in the Pilot it is a solid 8.5 at the very least. Tho the pilot was fairly predictable when it comes to crime shows that aren't CSI or Law and Order (i.e. one character is a fan of the other. Half way through everything is wrapped up a little too neatly etcetera), it was still an enjoyable romp.\n\nKate Beckett is a beautiful, hard nosed cop that should be working for a private law firm and Nick Castle is an arrogant, but devoted author and father.\n\nStana Katic (awesome name) is beautiful, but not so much that you wonder why she is a cop and not some goddess on an Italian beach like so many actresses tend to be. She plays her part very well, and the scene she has with Fillon when he, as Castle is peeling away her layers is amazing. She barely gives anything away until the very last moment, but with her facial expressions you know it's coming making her character all the more wonderful.\n\nNathan Fillion is wonderful as the successful, charismatic, and egocentric Pop mystery writer who seems to be not a drunk (unlike Hank Moody, played wonderfully by David Duchovney in Californication) and is a loving, attentive father apparently who also has an intriguing backstory with his publisher/ex-wife which I hope is a back story they continue to develop throughout the series.\n\nThis really was a fun series. I know new shows have a very short lifespan, but this is one I hope has a decent shelf life.

It has great cinematography, great action sequences and a breathtaking score by Hans Zimmer and to top it off, it has Arnold who - even though he looks older - is nowhere near obsolete. ;-)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":269876,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-07-08","keywords":"cyborg,future,sarah connor,time machine,human versus cyborg","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1249751321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1MTg5OTExOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM0OTEzNTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1MTg5OTExOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM0OTEzNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When John Connor, leader of the human resistance, sends Sgt.

After seeing it again recently, I think I have a more coherent idea of how I feel about this film.\n\nTo sum this film up neatly, it is a retelling of the story we know in Braveheart, with some alterations and being slightly worse.\n\nFrom a historical standpoint, The Patriot is about as historically accurate as Braveheart - that meaning that it really isn't. By now, many have already meticulously picked apart its inaccuracies so I won't really dwell on it too much. But as a piece of popular cinema, I don't think this film's intention is to be historically accurate anyway.\n\nThe Patriot is an impressive looking film, I believe. The action sequences are exciting to watch and the scale of the battles are appropriate enough where there aren't noticeable CGI people also partaking in the fight.\n\nSpeaking of the CG effects, they are looking a bit dated now. Some of the computer generated blue screen backgrounds don't look very convincing, especially when they go to Charles Town at the beginning of the film. But since the shots don't dwell too much on them, it's not too bi a deal, I believe.\n\nThe acting performances aren't bad at all. Mel Gibson found his niche after Braveheart and went with it and his performance here translates incredibly well. The actors that portray the various British officers in this film do put on a bit of a James Bond villain performance and it does get a little distracting, but there is some complexity in the writing at times that makes up for that in those moments.\n\nIt's also to be noted that the soundtrack for this film is amazing. Of course, this is the work of John Williams and it goes extraordinarily well when paired with this film. It is the shining aspect of this film and I cannot compliment it enough. It has to be one of the more underrated works John Williams has done.\n\nWhere this film ultimately loses me is when it comes to the issue of slavery. I understand this is among the myriad of other historical inaccuracies with this film, but it's this particular aspect of American history that really hurts it the most. The most obvious example of this is when the workers on Martin's farm say that they work his land but are not slaves. It is also framed in this film that the British army offering freedom to any slave who serves with them is a bad thing, but later when the American army announces something similar, suddenly it's righteous. This, of course, wasn't the case and it's very misleading. There's a scene in the film where Gabriel makes a promise that once the British are defeated, the old world will be pushed out and a new world can be built; one where all people are free. This is so obviously untrue but the film ignores it. As a result, it feels like the one slave character shown in the whole film is duped into serving with the continentals just to be enslaved again once the eventual government decides, through inaction, that slavery is necessary. I get images of the American Civil War in my mind every time I see that scene, and it's that scene that really hurts this film the most- but ironically enough, maybe the most accurate part of it...\n\nThe Patriot is interesting. I feel it's a bit long. Granted, I'm just coming from seeing the extended cut but I do think this film could have gone without some things. Not horrible if you're looking for a fictional story that takes place in a real time in history. Just don't use it as an educational tool unless you're going to talk about the uniforms and clothing of that period.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2000-07-19","keywords":"american revolution,hero,standoff,father son relationship,george washington character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Patriot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi100139289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcxNjY2N2MtNjllYy00OGE1LTgxMmYtZjYwOTc2MzEyYzVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcxNjY2N2MtNjllYy00OGE1LTgxMmYtZjYwOTc2MzEyYzVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Touchstone Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000154/","name":"Mel Gibson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005132/","name":"Heath Ledger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000613/","name":"Joely Richardson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007500/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Ova neobična serija upoznat će nas s tri različite obitelji koje, ustvari, čine jednu veliku, modernu i sretnu zajednicu! Njihov život nije ni uredan ni politički korektan, ili predvidljiv. Ova neobična serija upoznat će nas s tri različite obitelji koje, ustvari, čine jednu veliku, modernu i sretnu zajednicu! Jay Pritchett (Ed O'Neill) ima odraslu djecu i unuke iz prijašnjeg braka te veličanstvenu mladu ženu Gloriju (Sofia Vergara), koja je središte cijelog njegovog svijeta. Gloria je nepopravljivi sanjar, ona piše poeziju i rado se prepušta strastima, a iz prijašnje veze ima jedanaestogodišnjeg sina Mannyja Delgada (Rico Rodriguez) koji već počinje primjećivati cure. Jay bi više volio da je Manny tvrđeg karaktera jer ne zna kako drugačije odgajati i ponašati se pred tim "čudnim" klincem. Osim toga, Jay muku muči s percepcijom okoline koja misli da je on Glorijin otac, a ne muž, što mu stvara popriličnu nelagodu. Njih troje zajedno moraju, ukoliko žele živjeti u miru, premostiti generacijski, kulturni i socijalni jaz. Tu je i druga obitelj koju čine Phil (Ty Burrell) i Claire (Julie Bowen), par koji gaji zdrav, pošten i otvoren odnos prema svoje troje djece. Ponekad to i nije baš lako jer njihova kći tinejdžerica Haley (Sarah Hyland) sazrijeva malo prebrzo, srednja kći Alex (Ariel Winter) je prepametna za svoj uzrast, a sin Luke (Nolan Gould) je pomalo problematičan. Na kraju, upoznajemo i treću obitelj, Mitchella (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) i Camerona (Eric Stonestreet), vrhunskog odvjetnika i njegovog divnog, brižnog i veoma romantičnog životnog partnera. Njih dvojica odlučili su napraviti korak naprijed i posvojiti malenu djevojčicu Lily iz Vijetnama. Njihov život nije ni uredan ni politički korektan, ili na bilo koji način predvidljiv. Pravi gazda cijele obitelji je patrijarh Jay, a Claire i Mitchell su njegova odrasla djeca, dok su svi ostali u tom modernom plemenu otkačena ekipa kod koje se nikad ne zna što će im se dogoditi jer oni su strastveni, moderni, suludi i prepuni iznenađenja.</desc>

This prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark tries to out-do its predecessor for breakneck spills and gross-out moments, but the sparkle isn't quite there. It's an entertaining film for sure, but not as good as the original, partially because the plotting this time round is a little awkward and partially because Kate Capshaw as the main female character is an almighty irritation.\n\nThe film opens in a Shanghai restaurant, where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) causes a riot in pursuit of a diamond. Fleeing the scene with American singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and teenaged pick-pocket Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), he escapes to the airport. However, Indy and his companions unwittingly board an airplane owned by one of Indy's enemies, from which they have to make an audacious mid-air escape when the real pilots bail out mid-flight! Soon, the intrepid trio find themselves in India, where they come across a village in the grip of starvation. The village children have been kidnapped by local cultists to work in a mine, digging for the sacred Sankara Stones, and Indy is persuaded by the distraught villagers to rescue their youngsters. His quest takes him to the opulent Pankot Palace and, beneath it and beyond a maze of tunnels, the Temple of Doom.\n\nFord is great as Jones, bringing genuine charisma to a role that he was born to play (can you imagine how things would have turned out if Tom Selleck had got the part, as originally planned?) There are some great moments along the way too, including the intentionally subversive opening sequence in Shanghai, a particularly funny and exciting runaway mine-train sequence, and an unforgettable banquet at Pankot Palace in which the food served up is enough to churn any stomach. But Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom still can't live up to the standard set by Raiders of the Lost Ark. As mentioned, Capshaw is a real pain on the senses as the always-squealing heroine, and the plot seems to over-stretch in an effort to link to the next development or set piece. The hunt-for-the-missing-children plot device allows Spielberg to dip into the kind of cloying sentimentality that occasionally mars his films too. This is certainly an entertaining and professionally assembled film, but in no way a rival or an equal to the excellence of its predecessor.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":469637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1984-05-23","keywords":"india,prequel,shanghai china,indiana jones character,white savior","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2444476697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5ZTE3OTItMThmZC00ZjdhLWExMDEtZWQ5MDFjMmM5NjJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5ZTE3OTItMThmZC00ZjdhLWExMDEtZWQ5MDFjMmM5NjJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001009/","name":"Kate Capshaw"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702841/","name":"Ke Huy Quan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071326/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404754/","name":"Willard Huyck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0441718/","name":"Gloria Katz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000184/","name":"George Lucas"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Soon, the intrepid trio find themselves in India, where they come across a village in the grip of starvation. The village children have been kidnapped by local cultists to work in a mine, digging for the sacred Sankara Stones, and Indy is persuaded by the distraught villagers to rescue their youngsters. His quest takes him to the opulent Pankot Palace and, beneath it and beyond a maze of tunnels, the Temple of Doom.\n\nFord is great as Jones, bringing genuine charisma to a role that he was born to play (can you imagine how things would have turned out if Tom Selleck had got the part, as originally planned?) There are some great moments along the way too, including the intentionally subversive opening sequence in Shanghai, a particularly funny and exciting runaway mine-train sequence, and an unforgettable banquet at Pankot Palace in which the food served up is enough to churn any stomach. But Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom still can't live up to the standard set by Raiders of the Lost Ark. As mentioned, Capshaw is a real pain on the senses as the always-squealing heroine, and the plot seems to over-stretch in an effort to link to the next development or set piece. The hunt-for-the-missing-children plot device allows Spielberg to dip into the kind of cloying sentimentality that occasionally mars his films too. This is certainly an entertaining and professionally assembled film, but in no way a rival or an equal to the excellence of its predecessor.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":469637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1984-05-23","keywords":"india,prequel,shanghai china,indiana jones character,white savior","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2444476697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5ZTE3OTItMThmZC00ZjdhLWExMDEtZWQ5MDFjMmM5NjJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5ZTE3OTItMThmZC00ZjdhLWExMDEtZWQ5MDFjMmM5NjJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001009/","name":"Kate Capshaw","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702841/","name":"Ke Huy Quan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071326/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404754/","name":"Willard Huyck","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0441718/","name":"Gloria Katz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000184/","name":"George Lucas"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And not to mention give assorted actors who have all been great in projects not up to their talents, the chance to really shine in some very well-written roles, and I want to single out Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, Chandra Wilson and especially T.R. Knight as George, who is really coming into his own as this season progresses.\n\nNot to snub Isaiah Washington, James Pickens, Jr., Kate Walsh or the so-hot-it's-criminal Patrick Dempsey. Seasoned vets all, it's just good to see them all land in a nice place where they can do great work with some sense of job security. (WE HOPE.) \n\nRealistic enough to be accessible but not a turn-off, and whimsically light enough at other times without straying into "Stefan-the-Frog" territory, (are you listening, David Kelley?), "Grey's" should remain as a dependable Sunday night staple as long as creator/producer Shonda Rhimes and her crew are able to continue to strike that balance, and keep its newfound audience interested and entertained with the trials, tribulations and trysts of the staff at Seattle Grace Hospital.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":282211,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It consisted of 20 very short films, each with their own unique style and storyline, only they all shared the same setting of Paris. Three years later, another group of filmmakers and writers, including the late, great Anthony Minghella, decided to make a film consisting of short vignettes called New York, I Love You.\n\nThe idea is nice. It's endearing how a group of people can come together and present several different stories about a place that they love.\n\n(Pause for nice, smiling moment)\n\nOkay, back to the film. Now that we can agree that this is a nice idea, I think it's time to get serious. Much like Paris je t'aime, there are parts of this film that are nice. Still, overall I can't help but disagree with the construction of this film. I thought the stories were clever, but if I liked the story I didn't like the acting, or if I liked the acting, the directing was off. It was a never-ending stream of likes and dislikes.\n\nThere are some interesting segments. Brett Ratner's segment about a teenager trying to go to prom is clever and entertaining, starring Anton Yelchin, Olivia Thirlby, and James Caan. I thought Caan gave the most honest performance in the whole film. He had the look and most of all the sound of a New Yorker. I was even impressed with Natalie Portman's segment which follows a man looking after a young girl in Central Park.\n\nThere was nothing that blew me away like some of the parts of Paris, je t'aime. There was nothing here that made me say, "Wow!" For a film like this nice just doesn't cut it. I can forgive a few bad shorts for one or two really good ones. At least I can take something away from the film. I all took away from this were the various settings that New York City has to offer.\n\nMaking a compilation film is risky. One bad egg can spoil the rest, or in this case a lot of mediocre eggs can make for a bland film.

As the follow-up riding on "Housewives'" coattails, I was ready to dismiss it outright as "Ally McBeal in hospital scrubs." But not having much else to watch in that time slot, I decided to give it a try, and was I pleasantly shocked! Though there ARE some moments where the principal characters come off as self-centered, neurotic and at times downright eccentric, it never reached the level of absurdity that "Ally" often did, and thank God for that! Ellen Pompeo as Dr. Meredith Grey comes off as likable and probably more self-aware and introspective than self-absorbed and scatterbrained, though there are moments you do want to reach into the screen and give her a good shaking.\n\nAnd good call on the ensemble casting! You really have to give props to any show that FINALLY figures out how to effectively showcase the sweet-and-sour charms of Sandra Oh, who was good enough to elevate a sow's ear of a show like "Arli$$," if not to save it. And not to mention give assorted actors who have all been great in projects not up to their talents, the chance to really shine in some very well-written roles, and I want to single out Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, Chandra Wilson and especially T.R. Knight as George, who is really coming into his own as this season progresses.\n\nNot to snub Isaiah Washington, James Pickens, Jr., Kate Walsh or the so-hot-it's-criminal Patrick Dempsey. Seasoned vets all, it's just good to see them all land in a nice place where they can do great work with some sense of job security. (WE HOPE.) \n\nRealistic enough to be accessible but not a turn-off, and whimsically light enough at other times without straying into "Stefan-the-Frog" territory, (are you listening, David Kelley?), "Grey's" should remain as a dependable Sunday night staple as long as creator/producer Shonda Rhimes and her crew are able to continue to strike that balance, and keep its newfound audience interested and entertained with the trials, tribulations and trysts of the staff at Seattle Grace Hospital.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":282211,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As the follow-up riding on "Housewives'" coattails, I was ready to dismiss it outright as "Ally McBeal in hospital scrubs." But not having much else to watch in that time slot, I decided to give it a try, and was I pleasantly shocked! Though there ARE some moments where the principal characters come off as self-centered, neurotic and at times downright eccentric, it never reached the level of absurdity that "Ally" often did, and thank God for that! Ellen Pompeo as Dr. Meredith Grey comes off as likable and probably more self-aware and introspective than self-absorbed and scatterbrained, though there are moments you do want to reach into the screen and give her a good shaking.\n\nAnd good call on the ensemble casting! You really have to give props to any show that FINALLY figures out how to effectively showcase the sweet-and-sour charms of Sandra Oh, who was good enough to elevate a sow's ear of a show like "Arli$$," if not to save it. And not to mention give assorted actors who have all been great in projects not up to their talents, the chance to really shine in some very well-written roles, and I want to single out Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, Chandra Wilson and especially T.R. Knight as George, who is really coming into his own as this season progresses.\n\nNot to snub Isaiah Washington, James Pickens, Jr., Kate Walsh or the so-hot-it's-criminal Patrick Dempsey. Seasoned vets all, it's just good to see them all land in a nice place where they can do great work with some sense of job security. (WE HOPE.) \n\nRealistic enough to be accessible but not a turn-off, and whimsically light enough at other times without straying into "Stefan-the-Frog" territory, (are you listening, David Kelley?), "Grey's" should remain as a dependable Sunday night staple as long as creator/producer Shonda Rhimes and her crew are able to continue to strike that balance, and keep its newfound audience interested and entertained with the trials, tribulations and trysts of the staff at Seattle Grace Hospital."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":282211,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Well, it worked in Twins so why not do it again? Actually this time around he fares very well, balancing quite nicely his tough guy side (which we all love) and also his comedic side. His interaction with the children are hilarious and somewhat touching at times. Supporting cast do a nice job, particularly Reed as Arnie's partner and Hunt as his kindergarten supervisor.\n\nMany critics found the level of violence to be a little excessive considering it's listed as mainly a comedy, but I don't agree. Sure, there's some violence near the end, but it's relatively toned down.

Well, it worked in Twins so why not do it again? Actually this time around he fares very well, balancing quite nicely his tough guy side (which we all love) and also his comedic side. His interaction with the children are hilarious and somewhat touching at times. Supporting cast do a nice job, particularly Reed as Arnie's partner and Hunt as his kindergarten supervisor.\n\nMany critics found the level of violence to be a little excessive considering it's listed as mainly a comedy, but I don't agree. Sure, there's some violence near the end, but it's relatively toned down.

I attended the premiere of CARS at LMS on Friday, May 26. True to Disney form, the premiere itself was spectacular. Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the "original", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep. As always, don't leave your seat until all of the credits roll. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie! You'll love them this time, as they tie back to prior Pixar movies, in a car sort of way. This is definitely a movie we'll add to the DVD collection. I really hope this movie does well since it's the first release since Disney bought Pixar. Don't go in looking for the action or adult humor of The Incredibles. If you do you'll be disappointed. Just go in looking for the "Disney always has a good moral behind its animated movies" type of movie and you will really enjoy it. Paul Newman and Larry the Cable Guy really have the best characters in the movie. And while John Ratzenberger's character doesn't have a lot of screen time, I really enjoyed him! I'll be going back to see it when it releases in theaters so I can get a better feel for the sound, as it wasn't the best in an outdoor setting.

While Princess and the Frog was a missed opportunity, Tangled is almost perfect.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":428452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-12-01","keywords":"rapunzel,based on fairy tale,disney,flower,female protagonist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tangled: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi385091865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzI2NDA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE1OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzI2NDA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE1OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The long-haired Princess Rapunzel has spent her entire life in a tower, but when she falls in love with a bandit who was passing by she must venture into the outside world for the first time to find him.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601553/","name":"Mandy Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1157048/","name":"Zachary Levi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0614220/","name":"Donna Murphy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1977355/","name":"Nathan Greno","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0397174/","name":"Byron Howard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074039/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1557594/","name":"Dan Fogelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342278/","name":"Jacob Grimm","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342303/","name":"Wilhelm Grimm"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Car Marko Aurelije (R. Harris) pokušava spriječiti prodor barbarskih plemena na sjevernim granicama u čemu mu presudno pomaže hrabri posinak i vojskovođa Maximus (R. Crowe). Nakon pobjede u krvavom boju, ostarjeli vladar upravo u Maximusu vidi svog nasljednika, iako ga u Rimu čeka njegov rođeni sin Komod (J. Phoenix). Doznavši da će ostati bez carske titule, beskrupulozni Komod odluči ubrzati stupanje na prijestolje, te nakon očeve smrti zapovjedi ubistvo Maximusa i njegove porodice. Za razliku od porodice, Maximus izbjegne smrt, ali ne i odlazak u roblje pri čemu ga kupuje Proximo (O. Reed) koji trenira najbolje gladijatore u Carstvu. Postavši Proximov najslavniji borac u areni, Maximus se zavjetuje da će usred Rima osvetiti smrt svoje neprežaljene porodice.</desc>

It stars Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker.\n\nIt feels a bit silly to write it now, but there was a time when Reservoir Dogs barely made a ripple in the cinema loving world; in America that is. Upon its release in the States it was moderately successful and comfortably made back its $1.2 million budget. However, upon hitting the British shores it was a big hit and grossed nearly £6.5 million and then Pulp Fiction exploded on the world in 94 and Reservoir Dogs got reappraised in its home country. The rest as they say is history.\n\nTarantino, the most enthusiastic of film fans, was once a video store clerk in Redondo Beach. There he dreamed of making his own movies and planned to make Reservoir Dogs with his friends on a relatively small budget. As luck would have it, Keitel got hold of the script and wanted in. With his name attached, and using his contacts, a serious budget was raised and so the Dogs were set loose. At the time of its popularity, Tarantino had to guardedly fend off accusations of plagiarism and a charge of just hacking from older classic heist movies. His argument was that he was making his own homage to the heist caper, but even so, the fact remains that Reservoir Dogs is spliced from The Killing, Kansas City Confidential, The Big Combo, The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three and we can definitely throw in The Asphalt Jungle as well.\n\nYet Reservoir Dogs is still extraordinarily fresh and vibrant, raising the bar for crime movies in the modern era. Tarantino of course has since gone on to prove his worth with other projects, so in truth his homage movie was merely the foot in the door for the talented son of Knoxville, Tennessee. In terms of its dialogue, tho, and its gleeful use of "ultra-violence," it has few peers. From any decade. It also helps considerably that Tarantino has assembled a quality cast to make his non-linear classic shine. Keitel is a given, but Roth is exceptional, as too is Buscemi, while Madsen is frighteningly convincing as psycho for hire Mr. Blonde. Then there's the 70s soundtrack, a vital part of the narrative as we hear the dulcet tones of Steven Wright Djing on K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies. If you have not seen the film yet? Then I promise you will remember Stealers Wheel-Stuck in the Middle for the rest of your cinema loving days.\n\nAnd that's the thing with Reservoir Dogs, it's crammed packed full of memorable things. A quip, a bang, a song or the WTF ending, as homages go; it's one of the very best. 9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":969640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1992-09-02","keywords":"heist gone wrong,nonlinear timeline,mexican standoff,robbery,graphic violence","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Reservoir Dogs: 10th Anniversary Edition","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3028484377","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMDNkYTEtNzNlYi00OTU2LTg3ODMtMjg1MDUxZmIxYTFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMDNkYTEtNzNlYi00OTU2LTg3ODMtMjg1MDUxZmIxYTFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000172/","name":"Harvey Keitel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000514/","name":"Michael Madsen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000233/","name":"Quentin Tarantino"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0112857/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000233/","name":"Quentin Tarantino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000812/","name":"Roger Avary"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I thought it would be just another "social commentary" dystopian film trying to ride the coattails of The Hunger Games craze. Instead what I ended up getting was one of the best post-apocalyptic films I've ever seen. A smooth roller coaster of action and quiet, dark dialogue.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, it is another "social commentary" dystopian film, and yes, perhaps it's riding The Hunger Games craze just a little bit. But, when that riding ends up producing a film of this quality, is it a bad thing? And it's not like The Hunger Games invented the idea of alternative future where the poor are trying to usurp the rich people that are controlling them from their towers of ivory. These are both just variations of Orwell's 1984, which draws heavily from the age old tale of the underdog, David versus Goliath.\n\nIt's the execution of an idea that makes or breaks a film and here that execution is nigh flawless. Everything from the design of the train to the A-list cast of actors to the storyline that keeps up the relentless pace, but still has time to reflect on the motives, histories and moods of the characters.\n\nSnowpiercer is simplistic art. It doesn't try to win you over with limitless of details, high explosives or flashiness. Rather it takes a central idea and fills it with as much quality as possible. Highly recommended for all fans of science fiction out there.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":345264,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-08-01","keywords":"train,perpetual winter,closed ecological system,population control,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1214688537","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTYwNjUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5MTAyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTYwNjUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5MTAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a future where a failed global-warming experiment kills off all life on the planet except for a lucky few that boarded the Snowpiercer, a train that travels around the globe, where a class system evolves.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0262635/","name":"Chris Evans"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068260/","name":"Jamie Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0842770/","name":"Tilda Swinton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0094435/","name":"Bong Joon Ho"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0364224/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0157434/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058896/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2441468/","name":"Jacques Lob"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499429/","name":"Benjamin Legrand"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2440893/","name":"Jean-Marc Rochette"}],"duration":"PT2H6M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In a future where a failed climate change experiment has killed all life except for the survivors who boarded the Snowpiercer (a train that travels around the globe), a new class system emerges." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1706620/","name":"Snowpiercer","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3NzA1MTY3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE2Mzg5MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a future where a failed climate change experiment has killed all life except for the survivors who boarded the Snowpiercer (a train that travels around the globe), a new class system emerges.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1706620/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Vartiainen","dateCreated":"2014-10-02","inLanguage":"English","name":"Dark social science fiction","reviewBody":"Snowpiercer was a surprise to me. I thought it would be just another "social commentary" dystopian film trying to ride the coattails of The Hunger Games craze. Instead what I ended up getting was one of the best post-apocalyptic films I've ever seen. A smooth roller coaster of action and quiet, dark dialogue.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, it is another "social commentary" dystopian film, and yes, perhaps it's riding The Hunger Games craze just a little bit. But, when that riding ends up producing a film of this quality, is it a bad thing? And it's not like The Hunger Games invented the idea of alternative future where the poor are trying to usurp the rich people that are controlling them from their towers of ivory. These are both just variations of Orwell's 1984, which draws heavily from the age old tale of the underdog, David versus Goliath.\n\nIt's the execution of an idea that makes or breaks a film and here that execution is nigh flawless. Everything from the design of the train to the A-list cast of actors to the storyline that keeps up the relentless pace, but still has time to reflect on the motives, histories and moods of the characters.\n\nSnowpiercer is simplistic art. It doesn't try to win you over with limitless of details, high explosives or flashiness. Rather it takes a central idea and fills it with as much quality as possible. Highly recommended for all fans of science fiction out there.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":345264,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-08-01","keywords":"train,perpetual winter,closed ecological system,population control,dystopia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1214688537","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTYwNjUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5MTAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTYwNjUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5MTAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a future where a failed global-warming experiment kills off all life on the planet except for a lucky few that boarded the Snowpiercer, a train that travels around the globe, where a class system evolves.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0262635/","name":"Chris Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068260/","name":"Jamie Bell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0842770/","name":"Tilda Swinton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0094435/","name":"Bong Joon Ho"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0364224/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0157434/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058896/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2441468/","name":"Jacques Lob","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499429/","name":"Benjamin Legrand","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2440893/","name":"Jean-Marc Rochette"],"duration":"PT2H6M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Trying to ignore all the hype around it, I tried to watch it (on DVD) as the second sequel to one of my favourite films, nothing more. Although it comes nowhere near the quality of the first film, it does try to recreate its pleasant pacing and isn't overstuffed with easy film/commercial/real life-reference jokes (I'm looking at you, Shrek 2). And if one pops up, than it got more laughs out of me than Far Far Away ever did in Shrek 2. The Medieval high School was just hilarious, especially the mix-up between today's teen slang and Middle English. As an English student, it really appealed to me.\n\nI really liked the dialogue between the characters like in Shrek 1, it's something I kind of missed in Shrek 2, where the characters just jumped from one crazy situation to the next with a few one-liners her and there. What I did miss, was the bickering between Puss and Donkey. Both characters do in fact get way too little screen time, and that's a big mistake since both characters were the highlights of Shrek 2. Somewhere near the end they do get in a situation that brings back some of the comedy gold of Shrek 2, but it's too little and too late.\n\nAll the old characters get to do something funny, but in the end they are all just great to see as old friends you know from the past. It's nice to see Donkey, Puss and Shrek get along so well with each other, but there's nothing more they can do to fill another film. We know the characters, and they have all found a place in the world they live in. I have gotten all I wanted out of the overall storyline, I'm happy with the way things are for the characters now, and I don't mind that the third journey had to replace the "insert joke every few seconds"-mentality of Shrek 2 with a bit more storytelling. There were still plenty of big laughs left, I can tell you.\n\nUltimately, Shrek 2 was funnier, but I think I like Shrek 3 better. I felt that this adventure was more meaningful for all the characters, and I know that this is the part where a lot of critics thought it wasn't necessary. But if you ask me, Shrek 3 was unnecessary. But since they really had to make a Shrek 3, I think they did well to make the adventure a bit more meaningful and make it really count in the end. It's only too bad that the message is the same of the previous two films, we get it already.\n\nThe only thing I really didn't like was one of the major characters they used to tell us again that you must accept yourself and others as they are. Artie was a really un-Shrek character. His speeches were dull and Justin Timberlake does nothing to make the character more likable. Of course, he has little to work with. I liked Justin timberlake's part better as a poster in Shrek 2 with the text "Sir Justin". It was funnier than anything Artie said or did in Shrek 3. Let Shrek, Donkey or Puss do the talking, dude.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, Shrek 3 was an unnecessary sequel that still worked for me with some good humour and the characters being as charming as ever. The story was more meaningful for the main characters. The end of this adventure, even though repeating the message of the previous films, provided me with satisfying closure on the story of the happy Shrek family. Too bad that another unnecessary sequel is coming, undoubtedly with even more hype and more dull characters like Artie. Sadly, the Shrek franchise seems to be the most inspired thing coming from Dreamworks Animations.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":294501,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2007-06-06","keywords":"shrek,king,puss in boots,donkey,kingdom","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shrek the Third","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1484980505","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI0NmI0MTItYzIzNy00YzcwLTk3ZmItZDU0MTAyM2JjOGRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI0NmI0MTItYzIzNy00YzcwLTk3ZmItZDU0MTAyM2JjOGRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Dreamworks"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000552/","name":"Eddie Murphy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1844237/","name":"Chris Miller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0401203/","name":"Raman Hui"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040938/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0696949/","name":"Jeffrey Price"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0780620/","name":"Peter S.

While I too have fond memories of seeing the original animated version at the theatre, I was at least willing to give this one a chance. I'm glad I did. Firstly, people need to realise an animated film and live-action film are two different things. Some things that work in animation just won't translate too well into live-action. The other thing to accept is that, short of resurrecting Robin Williams, there was no way they were ever going to be able to replicate his unique take on the character of the Genie. Once you open your mind to the possibility that something can be 'different' but also *good*; then you'll have a more pleasant experience. That's what we get here: a movie that is familiar, but at the same time new/different (and that's not a bad thing).\n\nFrom the very beginning, the movie is somewhat different to what we might be expecting when we're introduced to who is telling the story. While it was immediately evident to me what was going on, it wasn't a 'bad' addition. After sweeping shots set to the song 'Arabian Nights', we're introduced to the 'street rat' named Aladdin. Although much fuss has been made about the Genie casting, if Aladdin had been miscast, then the whole film would've suffered. Thankfully, I can say that I almost immediately liked Mena Massoud in the role. He's funny, got moves/charm, makes for a likeable 'thief' and his relationship with his pet monkey, Abu, is as good as I'd hoped it'd be. Speaking of, although people think of CGI characters badly a lot of the time, it must be made clear the animal companions in this are all wonderfully brought to life/fully-realised characters. Abu is expressive, funny, and helpful (despite sometimes getting them both into trouble).\n\nNot before long Aladdin encounters Princess Jasmine (a well-cast Naomi Scott, who does a lot with the character and should make most Jasmine fans proud), who's undercover among the people. I was afraid that the movie would rush through their first meeting, but was happy with the amount of time devoted to them developing an interest in each other. I could instantly tell that the beloved character of Jasmine was in safe hands as portrayed by Naomi Scott and that she had nice chemistry with Massoud's Aladdin. Although not given as much to do as Abu, Jasmine's loyal tiger companion, Rajah, is another lovely animal created with CGI, who I appreciated wasn't largely ignored. Jasmine's other loyal friend, her handmaiden named Dalia, is actually a stand-out character in the movie. Nasim Pedrad has excellent comic timing, as does Naomi Scott, which is on full display in a fun scene where Aladdin comes to the palace and Jasmine attempts to maintain her cover.\n\nThe one 'miss' in the casting department is that of Marwan Kenzari as villainous Jafar. While others had pre-judged him based on the trailers alone, I was willing to give him a chance to make up for his lack of sinister voice with what would hopefully be at least a menacing performance. Sadly, he lacks even that. There's nothing particularly memorable about his portrayal (even near the end when he's given every opportunity to unleash in full-on villain mode, he falls way short). About the only 'positive' I could find regarding his character is his animal companion of Iago. The red parrot might not be quite as talkative as the animated version, but he *does* talk (and in a much more bird-like way), getting a few funny lines here and there (I'd expect nothing less from Alan Tudyk providing the voice). It's just disappointing that Jafar's miscast, and thus the 'weak link' in the film.\n\nWhat most people are probably wondering about is Will Smith as the Genie. I actually thought he was pretty good here (and I found him more likeable in this role than I have in any movie I've seen him in since probably the first Men In Black). There are just one or two instances where I felt he tried to emulate Robin Williams' version and it didn't quite work, but on the whole I felt he brought his own energy/style to the character of Genie and it (mostly) worked. The most important thing was the friendship that he formed with Aladdin. While Smith's Genie may seem a bit more snarky than you might expect, when it comes to the emotional beats, his performance hits the right notes (especially near the end).\n\nSpeaking of notes, "What about the songs?" you may ask. I was pretty happy with them, there were just the right amount and they didn't feel particularly intrusive in any of the scenes they were featured. Even the new song, 'Speechless', isn't too bad (though there are those who'll no doubt complain). Massoud and Scott have really nice singing voices and did their songs justice, I thought. Will Smith's also decent with his main songs in the movie (the end credits one I could've done without, though).\n\nI must also praise the costumes (Jasmine's are all stunning, as is Jasmine herself), the use of vibrant colours is quite impressive and the overall look of the film feels like something new/different to what we've seen time and time again in films (especially Disney ones). Things I forgot to mention: the Magic Carpet has as much 'character' as in the original (I especially appreciated seeing how close friends Carpet and Abu became by the end), and even the Sultan's head guard, Hakim, is given some depth.\n\nIn conclusion, if you go into the theatre already disliking/hating the film based on just the trailers, then you're probably going to leave the same way you entered: bitter and thinking things like "It ruined my childhood!" (such a rubbish statement). Just try accepting this is a different thing and hopefully you'll enjoy it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249421,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2019-05-22","keywords":"hero,monkey,genie character,tiger,parrot","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Aladdin","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3875453977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBlZWE0ODEtY2VkNi00OTJiLTg5MzMtNjcyYTU3NDExY2U3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBlZWE0ODEtY2VkNi00OTJiLTg5MzMtNjcyYTU3NDExY2U3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4565815/","name":"Mena Massoud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4305463/","name":"Naomi Scott"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0226345/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0699871/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"}],"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In truth, the Spartans were backed by a mixed force of almost 7,000, while there are enormous variations in modern estimates of the multi-ethnic Persian army, but somewhere between 100,000-200,000 seems realistic. Whatever the actual figures, the odds against the Spartans were terrible, death was inevitable, and their honour secure.\n\nThe story was first told on film in 1962 when director Rudolph Maté went to Greece and shot a worthy, but conventional and surprisingly leaden, version entitled "The 300 Spartans", starring American Richard Egan as King Leonidas and the British David Farrar as Xerxes. "300" takes the same basic narrative and presents it in an utterly different style in a blood-fest when "The Wild Bunch" meets "Kill Bill" and the visuals are like nothing except "Sin City". This time the director is Zack Snyder, known for his music videos, and the location is a studio set in Montreal with green backgrounds later filled by superb computer-generated graphics and the whole storybook style is based on the graphic novel by co-producer Frank Miller. Both versions use the legendary exchange: "When we attack today, our arrows will blot out the sun!" "Good; then we will fight in the shade." But only "300" has such fun lines as: "Spartans! Enjoy your breakfast, for tonight we dine in Hell!" \n\nEver since its first public showing at the Berlin Film Festival, most critics have mauled "300" and it presents an easy target for those wanting something more cerebral: there is virtually no plot or characterisation, the script is sparse and bland, much of the acting is exaggerated and over-loud, when it is not homo-erotic it is oddly camp, and the whole thing is stereotypical when it is not outright xenophobic and politically incorrect. And yet, as entertainment, it has much to offer: the sepia-tinged visuals are absolutely stunning and the fight sequences viscerally exciting. I was fortunate enough to see it in IMAX and I regularly felt blood-splattered and exhausted and quite ready to leap into the action.\n\nThere are no big names in the cast list which helps the sense of history but does not raise the thespian talent quotient. Gerard Butler plays King Leonidas with a Scottish accent, while the Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro is a version of Xerxes bejewelled with ethnic metalwork. Most of the warriors are literally larger than life: the actors playing the Spartans reveal most of their bodies with digitally-enhanced muscles, while on Xerxes' side characters include a huge hunchback, a giant emissary and a claw-armed executioner as well the metal-masked Immortals. This is before we get on to an enormous raging rhino and bedecked elephants. Truly this is a battle with a circus-like cast. The love interest comes from the feisty wife of Leonidas, Queen Gorgo, portrayed by the alluring British actress Lena Headey. There is even a scene in a rippling corn field borrowed from "Gladiator".\n\nAt the end of the day, what makes the movie are the thrilling fight sequences with encounters in which the film is slowed down and then speeded up to give a video-game quality that is unlike anything you have previously seen on the big screen.

The gang at Dreamworks was smart enough not to monkey around with a winning formula, so you have all the wit and charm of Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and all the fantastic fairy-tale creatures.\n\nAt the beginning of 2, Shrek and Fiona have been invited by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) to the family castle. Imagine their surprise when the honeymooning ogres show up! Seems the king and queen haven't heard that a) Fiona's an ogre and b) that her husband is one, too. Naturally, this doesn't sit particularly well with the king, and soon he's hired a hit man - Puss in Boots, no less, voiced by Antonio Banderas - to bump off his new son in law. Meanwhile, a Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) offers help to Fiona. And quickly, the main question of the film - conveniently, it was the main question of the first film - is whether love conquers all. Oh, perhaps it's a bit more complex than that - perhaps it's whether Fiona would love Shrek, no matter what he looked like. Come to think of it, that was the theme of the first one as well. \n\nShrek and Fiona journey to the land of Far, Far Away, where the stuffy king and the queen mum live. Far, Far Away is a clear knockoff of Hollywood itself (complete with the sign on the mountain), and the journey includes a pass through what looks like Beverly Hills. The attention to detail is marvelous, as always.\n\nAs with 1, 2 drops all sorts of Disney references, most resulting in full-out belly laughter. I was in stitches, although perhaps - just perhaps - some of the humor will zoom over your tiny tot's tiny head.\n\nShrek 2 is a beautifully done movie, perhaps even more entertaining than the original. Sure, at the end you know your emotions have been manipulated somewhat, but in the end you really don't care. Outstanding voice performances, flawless animation, and a crisp, moderately adult (but not mature, definitely not mature) script reign supreme.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":441517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2004-08-04","keywords":"reference to spider man,ogre,cat,princess,puss in boots","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shrek 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1447231513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRhNGQwNjUtYmFlMS00ODdiLWI3YTUtNjViOWYzZmU2YzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRhNGQwNjUtYmFlMS00ODdiLWI3YTUtNjViOWYzZmU2YzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Dreamworks"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000552/","name":"Eddie Murphy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011470/","name":"Andrew Adamson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0038432/","name":"Kelly Asbury"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0970447/","name":"Conrad Vernon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0825308/","name":"William Steig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011470/","name":"Andrew Adamson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0830294/","name":"Joe Stillman"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.\n\nA masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own.

After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.\n\nA masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own.

Nova priča zatječe Dianu Prince kako neprimjetno živi među smrtnicima u živahnim, elegantnim 1980-ima - eri hedonizma i želje za posjedovanjem. Iako je u potpunosti razvila svoje moći, ona ostaje pritajena, bavi se prikupljanjem drevnih artefakta, a herojska djela izvodi samo potajno. Međutim, Diana će uskoro morati skupiti svu svoju snagu, mudrost i hrabrost kad se sukobi s Maxwellom Lordom i Cheetom, zlikovkom koja posjeduje nadljudsku snagu i spretnost.</desc>

He claims it's part of an Obama/Occupy conspiracy to brainwash kids with pro-environment/anti-business messages. Dr. Seuss wrote the story in 1971, when President Obama was 10; and, given how long it takes to draw and voice such productions, most, if not all the work was done long before the Occupy Movement began.\n\nThe premise is a dystopic reality beneath the idyllic surface of a town that's 100% artificial, after all the trees were chopped up to make a certain product. Greed and short-sighted thinking led to lurking disaster. But what's new, or even controversial, about that? For decades, the entire lumber industry has understood the need for planned re-foresting to assure the future availability of raw materials, and its own survival. As to the politicizing polemics, Wall-E presented an even gloomier future with otiose blobs of humanity floating in space above the garbage-strewn Earth they had to abandon. That came out before the 2008 elections. I don't recall the original Mr. Dobbs, or the pod overlord who apparently evicted him from his own flesh, blaming that one on President Bush.\n\nMore importantly (and rationally), the film offers fun for all ages with delightful visuals, a perky pace, a few first-rate musical numbers and several well-crafted characters. Danny DeVito, Zac Efron and the blissfully ubiquitous Betty White head the voice cast. The 3-D option is a fine enhancement, making a number of scenes more exciting than 2-D. And, if every ticket purchased pains those pod people trying to pass for humans, eventually driving them back to their home planet, consider that a bonus.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106626,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-03-14","keywords":"corrupt mayor,crooked mayor,heroine,betrayal,cat","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1238212889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMzY0MDY3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY3NzYzNw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMzY0MDY3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY3NzYzNw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A 12-year-old boy searches for the one thing that will enable him to win the affection of the girl of his dreams.

He claims it's part of an Obama/Occupy conspiracy to brainwash kids with pro-environment/anti-business messages. Dr. Seuss wrote the story in 1971, when President Obama was 10; and, given how long it takes to draw and voice such productions, most, if not all the work was done long before the Occupy Movement began.\n\nThe premise is a dystopic reality beneath the idyllic surface of a town that's 100% artificial, after all the trees were chopped up to make a certain product. Greed and short-sighted thinking led to lurking disaster. But what's new, or even controversial, about that? For decades, the entire lumber industry has understood the need for planned re-foresting to assure the future availability of raw materials, and its own survival. As to the politicizing polemics, Wall-E presented an even gloomier future with otiose blobs of humanity floating in space above the garbage-strewn Earth they had to abandon. That came out before the 2008 elections. I don't recall the original Mr. Dobbs, or the pod overlord who apparently evicted him from his own flesh, blaming that one on President Bush.\n\nMore importantly (and rationally), the film offers fun for all ages with delightful visuals, a perky pace, a few first-rate musical numbers and several well-crafted characters. Danny DeVito, Zac Efron and the blissfully ubiquitous Betty White head the voice cast. The 3-D option is a fine enhancement, making a number of scenes more exciting than 2-D. And, if every ticket purchased pains those pod people trying to pass for humans, eventually driving them back to their home planet, consider that a bonus.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106626,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-03-14","keywords":"corrupt mayor,crooked mayor,heroine,betrayal,cat","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1238212889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMzY0MDY3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY3NzYzNw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMzY0MDY3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY3NzYzNw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A 12-year-old boy searches for the one thing that will enable him to win the affection of the girl of his dreams.

In 2014, upon the announcement of 'The Lego Movie', despite my love for the toy, I was kinda doubting the general premise. How could you make a movie out of Lego? Well, that question was soon answered as I gawped in awe at the screen, the movie was fantastic. Now, the character from 'The Lego Movie'' that garnered the most love was Batman, a cocky, sarcastic, childish take on the superhero we know and love... well it was only going to be a matter of time before he got his own motion picture.\n\n'The Lego Batman Movie' was definitely an enjoyable ride, and whilst I think it lacks in comparison to its predecessor, it stills thrusts us back into the universe that we came to revere in 2014. With an admirable cast of voice talent, and stunning animated visuals, 'The Lego Batman Movie' boasts undeniable creative talent, but does at times seem to be trying a little too hard to be funny, building off the reputation the initial film garnered.\n\nIs this film worth viewing? Most definitely, it's a hilarious feel- good animated comedy, and definitely perfect for the younger audience. I actually saw this film prior to its full release during a preview a few days early, however I believe it may have been aimed more as a kids matinée... I was literally the only adult there, shameful I know, but heck, I didn't care. The kids in the audience continually laughed with glee, so its definitely something suited for that kind of audience, but don't skip over the older adults who are still children at heart, it's an alluring comedy that piles on the laughs, definitely worth a watch."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140051,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"If you liked Shrek ..." And it's so true. Fans of the first will be ga-ga over the second. The gang at Dreamworks was smart enough not to monkey around with a winning formula, so you have all the wit and charm of Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and all the fantastic fairy-tale creatures.\n\nAt the beginning of 2, Shrek and Fiona have been invited by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) to the family castle. Imagine their surprise when the honeymooning ogres show up! Seems the king and queen haven't heard that a) Fiona's an ogre and b) that her husband is one, too. Naturally, this doesn't sit particularly well with the king, and soon he's hired a hit man - Puss in Boots, no less, voiced by Antonio Banderas - to bump off his new son in law. Meanwhile, a Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) offers help to Fiona. And quickly, the main question of the film - conveniently, it was the main question of the first film - is whether love conquers all. Oh, perhaps it's a bit more complex than that - perhaps it's whether Fiona would love Shrek, no matter what he looked like. Come to think of it, that was the theme of the first one as well. \n\nShrek and Fiona journey to the land of Far, Far Away, where the stuffy king and the queen mum live. Far, Far Away is a clear knockoff of Hollywood itself (complete with the sign on the mountain), and the journey includes a pass through what looks like Beverly Hills. The attention to detail is marvelous, as always.\n\nAs with 1, 2 drops all sorts of Disney references, most resulting in full-out belly laughter.

"If you liked Shrek ..." And it's so true. Fans of the first will be ga-ga over the second. The gang at Dreamworks was smart enough not to monkey around with a winning formula, so you have all the wit and charm of Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and all the fantastic fairy-tale creatures.\n\nAt the beginning of 2, Shrek and Fiona have been invited by Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) to the family castle. Imagine their surprise when the honeymooning ogres show up! Seems the king and queen haven't heard that a) Fiona's an ogre and b) that her husband is one, too. Naturally, this doesn't sit particularly well with the king, and soon he's hired a hit man - Puss in Boots, no less, voiced by Antonio Banderas - to bump off his new son in law. Meanwhile, a Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) offers help to Fiona. And quickly, the main question of the film - conveniently, it was the main question of the first film - is whether love conquers all. Oh, perhaps it's a bit more complex than that - perhaps it's whether Fiona would love Shrek, no matter what he looked like. Come to think of it, that was the theme of the first one as well. \n\nShrek and Fiona journey to the land of Far, Far Away, where the stuffy king and the queen mum live. Far, Far Away is a clear knockoff of Hollywood itself (complete with the sign on the mountain), and the journey includes a pass through what looks like Beverly Hills. The attention to detail is marvelous, as always.\n\nAs with 1, 2 drops all sorts of Disney references, most resulting in full-out belly laughter. I was in stitches, although perhaps - just perhaps - some of the humor will zoom over your tiny tot's tiny head.\n\nShrek 2 is a beautifully done movie, perhaps even more entertaining than the original.

The film was foot-tapping fun and the dark turn it took in the third act, while unexpected, made it edgy and different for me. When a sequel was announced, I thought it seemed unnecessary. How far can you really stretch the premise of penguins who can dance and sing? Apparently, not that far. After viewing the sequel, it very much does seem unnecessary and wholly forgettable within ten minutes after you walk out of the theater, which is disappointing to say the least. Other than this, the main problem with HAPPY FEET 2 is that there aren't that many good musical numbers as compared to the first one. Most of them are pretty mediocre. However, there are probably around three that range from good to great, one of which uses the song "Under Pressure," which is easily the best number in the entire film.\n\nAnother problem I had was the dark tone of the film. It's a bit TOO dark, if you ask me. You see the younger penguin characters constantly be put in danger which made the film very uncomfortable to watch, and what these characters go through in the film would probably traumatize them for life. The film also suffers from messy storytelling. For example, the subplot with the shrimp characters (voiced by Matt Damon and Brad Pitt) seems to come from nowhere and is out of place from the rest of the film. It also doesn't help that the characters are so damn annoying. As for the 3D, it's put to good use in some places but, overall, it's really unnecessary. The one good thing I can say about the film is the look of it, which is very beautiful. I also liked Pink a lot, who gives a boost for all the musical numbers she sings in, along with Robin Williams, who has a few great jokes up his sleeves.\n\nOverall, HAPPY FEET 2 is a disappointment considering that I am a fan of the first film. Director George Miller doesn't seem to have his heart in the right place for this sequel compared to the first film.

It's a solid study of a character's mind unwinding. Perhaps a few of the directorial decisions were unwise but I see no way in which they undermined the movie to the extent that it is a 36 metacritic/22 rotten tomatoes. It is honestly baffling to me. The garbage I have seen get positive ratings and this gets that? It honestly boggles the mind.\n\nIt is a promising first movie from the very talented Noah Hawley and I seriously hope the bizarre reaction to this movie does not hamper his future career.

Vjerojatno omiljena filmska franšiza jedne generacije, Rocky je svačiji omiljeni austajder. Ono što se događalo iza kamere jednako je fascinantno; Sylvester Stallone bio je gotovo nepoznati glumac sa snom. Poput svog lika u filmu, Sylvester je izašao na kraj s izazovom svog života i svijetu podario ovaj legendarni serijal. Pogledajte kako nas sam Sylvester Stallone vodi kroz kućne filmove i snimke iza kulisa kao da smo u njegovoj dnevnoj sobi i gledamo to zajedno s njim. Ovaj intimni dokumentarac potpisuje nevjerojatno nadareni, nagrađivani redatelj Derek Wayne Johnson.</desc>

This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.\n\nTwo and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.\n\nIt also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.\n\nThe humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.\n\nThe voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.\n\nOther than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.\n\nDan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.\n\nRupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.\n\nThe Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.\n\nRobbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.\n\nDavid Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.\n\nThe most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.\n\nThe world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)\n\nThe set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.\n\nThe score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.\n\nThe feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.\n\nSo it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.\n\n8/10 at the very least.

This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.\n\nTwo and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.\n\nIt also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.\n\nThe humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.\n\nThe voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.\n\nOther than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.\n\nDan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.\n\nRupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.\n\nThe Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.\n\nRobbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.\n\nDavid Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.\n\nThe most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.\n\nThe world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)\n\nThe set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.\n\nThe score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.\n\nThe feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.\n\nSo it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.\n\n8/10 at the very least.

So I was truly delighted to enjoy this movie so much. It had a lot to live up to.\n\nThe first thing I must say is that it is exquisitely photographed. The atmosphere set by the beautiful cinematography, is perfect. The film deserves to be nominated for an Oscar on that basis alone. I am in awe of the technical crew and director who could find such unspoiled vistas and such perfect weather in England, and I say that as a Brit who used to live very close to some of the eastern England locations! I sat right through to the end of the credits to see where it was shot, because I assumed it must have been filmed in some remote, rural, continental European locale. I felt quite ashamed that I had doubted the ability of my native land to still provide such delightful scenery! The mist rising off early morning fields, geese on a perfect farm pond, magnificent country estates and enormous trees more usually associated with California than England. Also perfect were the interiors. The air of genteel poverty in which the Bennets lived was well captured. The slightly down at heel scruffiness of the Bennet's farm and house, and the general dirtiness of 18th century life for most people, contrasted well with the ridiculous, rich fussiness of Lady Catherine de Bourg's house and the stark, museum-like beauty of Darcy's home.\n\nThe cast were excellent. I thought Rosamunde Pike as Jane Bennet was perfect, Simon Woods as Mr Bingley was charming although perhaps a little too puppyish, I enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn as Mr and Mrs Bennet and I'm one who thinks Matthew MacFadyen did a very good job as Mr Darcy, a characterization which was slightly more user-friendly than Colin Firth's 1995 Darcy. Also outstanding were Claudie Blakley as plain Charlotte Lucas, rescued from a life of unmarried oblivion by pompous Mr Collins (a very good Tom Hollander) and Kelly Reilly, as the bitchy Miss Bingley. Is Rupert Friend (Mr Wickham) destined to play Orlando Bloom's brother? Am I alone in seeing a similarity? Of course, Keira Knightley plays the title role of Elizabeth. I have followed her career closely since Bend it Like Beckham, and I thought this easily her best acting performance so far.

So I was truly delighted to enjoy this movie so much. It had a lot to live up to.\n\nThe first thing I must say is that it is exquisitely photographed. The atmosphere set by the beautiful cinematography, is perfect. The film deserves to be nominated for an Oscar on that basis alone. I am in awe of the technical crew and director who could find such unspoiled vistas and such perfect weather in England, and I say that as a Brit who used to live very close to some of the eastern England locations! I sat right through to the end of the credits to see where it was shot, because I assumed it must have been filmed in some remote, rural, continental European locale. I felt quite ashamed that I had doubted the ability of my native land to still provide such delightful scenery! The mist rising off early morning fields, geese on a perfect farm pond, magnificent country estates and enormous trees more usually associated with California than England. Also perfect were the interiors. The air of genteel poverty in which the Bennets lived was well captured. The slightly down at heel scruffiness of the Bennet's farm and house, and the general dirtiness of 18th century life for most people, contrasted well with the ridiculous, rich fussiness of Lady Catherine de Bourg's house and the stark, museum-like beauty of Darcy's home.\n\nThe cast were excellent. I thought Rosamunde Pike as Jane Bennet was perfect, Simon Woods as Mr Bingley was charming although perhaps a little too puppyish, I enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn as Mr and Mrs Bennet and I'm one who thinks Matthew MacFadyen did a very good job as Mr Darcy, a characterization which was slightly more user-friendly than Colin Firth's 1995 Darcy. Also outstanding were Claudie Blakley as plain Charlotte Lucas, rescued from a life of unmarried oblivion by pompous Mr Collins (a very good Tom Hollander) and Kelly Reilly, as the bitchy Miss Bingley. Is Rupert Friend (Mr Wickham) destined to play Orlando Bloom's brother? Am I alone in seeing a similarity? Of course, Keira Knightley plays the title role of Elizabeth. I have followed her career closely since Bend it Like Beckham, and I thought this easily her best acting performance so far. She captured the playfulness and wit of Lizzie's bright mind wonderfully well, and made me think long and hard how truly frustrating it must have been to be an intelligent young woman in a world that expected nothing more of her than an ability to choose ribbon and to capture a husband possessed of money. The only possible slight criticism I might make, is that Keira Knightley is perhaps a little too waif-like to pull off the 18th century characterization entirely convincingly. She is stunningly beautiful, but her stick thin appearance alongside her more robust looking screen sisters, made her look as if Mr Bennet might well have doubted her parentage!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":278163,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"pride and prejudice,england,gentleman,bachelor,prejudice","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pride &amp; Prejudice","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3045130521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOTY1MDktM2IxMy00MTA4LWI4NjEtNWM1ZjNmMWJmMzkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOTY1MDktM2IxMy00MTA4LWI4NjEtNWM1ZjNmMWJmMzkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Focus Features","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532193/","name":"Matthew Macfadyen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000950/","name":"Brenda Blethyn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942504/","name":"Joe Wright"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0595738/","name":"Deborah Moggach","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000807/","name":"Jane Austen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000668/","name":"Emma Thompson"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I would say I had pretty low knowledge in films before I first saw Inside Out (not to say that I'm highly intelligent on films now). I only saw about 200 films prior. I hadn't seen a lot of classic films or even know that film can be an art form just through its camera work among other aspects. So you could say that I can't speak for everyone on my views of this film. And you may be right because opinions are subjective anyway.\n\nThis is my favourite film ever.\n\nLike I said above, I didn't see a lot of films that were deemed as masterpieces at that time. While I still have a lot more to see, I can say that I have caught up with many notable ones now. I've seen The Godfather. I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen Casablanca. I've seen The Shawshank Redemption. I've seen Pulp Fiction. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nYet this is still my favourite film of all-time.\n\n80 years from now, this won't change. I felt something extraordinary that will never be felt again. This to me, was a revelation. In honest words I've never experienced something like this before. Only because of Inside Out I was able to kick myself off of a serious depression I had for years, understand the meaning of feeling, feel sympathy to why people act the way they do, be interested in films. In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.\n\nEver since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).\n\nInside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.\n\nIn the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.\n\nYou can vote "not helpful" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here....

This is my third movie I've seen by him and he still has not disappointed me. I remember when I first saw Kick Ass and was blown away with how great it is (probably in my top 25). \n\nThis film is a big shout out (basically) to old spy films. It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.\n\nThe action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.\n\nThere really aren't any huge gripes for this movie.

This is my third movie I've seen by him and he still has not disappointed me. I remember when I first saw Kick Ass and was blown away with how great it is (probably in my top 25). \n\nThis film is a big shout out (basically) to old spy films. It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.\n\nThe action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.\n\nThere really aren't any huge gripes for this movie. The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act. \n\nKingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments.

Starring Robert De Niro and Michelle Pffeifer, The Wizard of Lies features a strong cast of seasoned actors that give their best on screen. De Niro particularly is very strong here and gives his best performance in close to a decade. However, the film suffers from a broken and jumbled script that leaves for a somewhat confusing watch.\n\nThe film begins with an interview between Madoff and the subsequent author of his unofficial biography. He begins telling the story at the end of the meltdown on the eve of his arrest and starts from there. From here on out, we're told the story in chunks and pieces, from one perspective to another and totally abandons all formality regarding coherent storytelling. Instead, Levinson creates a deeply personal character study that paints Madoff as a sociopath and a white collar criminal mastermind who would rather blame the victim than himself. While it is engrossing to see De Niro as Madoff, it is barely enough to sustain its bloated runtime.\n\nThe film is engrossing to watch. There's no denying it but as the minutes ticked by, it all started to feel redundant. It was more so just dragging the entire Madoff family through hell for the remaining hour of the film and it becomes exhausting after awhile. In a way it was very much a Greek tragedy of epic proportions that just didn't seem to end and by the time it decided it wanted to, you were already checked out 10 minutes prior. Despite this, the ending is satisfying for those wanting to see karma at its best or a tragedy at its worst, whatever way you want to look at it.\n\nOverall, The Wizard of Lies is a missed opportunity more so than not. While it is great to see De Niro and Pfeiffer in top forms, it would have been nice to get a more coherent script from a story that literally writes itself. While anyone expecting a film in the vein of The Big Short will be let down by this, The Wizard of Lies benefits from being a deep character study that shines a (small) light of one of the most tragic mysteries of the 2008 financial crisis.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24376,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-20","keywords":"financial fraud,financier,ponzi scheme,fraudster,fraud","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tonight 8/7c","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi42121497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005273/","name":"Alessandro Nivola"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001469/","name":"Barry Levinson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063961/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506094/","name":"Sam Levinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2331718/","name":"John Burnham Schwartz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345603/","name":"Samuel Baum"}],"duration":"PT2H13M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Starring Robert De Niro and Michelle Pffeifer, The Wizard of Lies features a strong cast of seasoned actors that give their best on screen. De Niro particularly is very strong here and gives his best performance in close to a decade. However, the film suffers from a broken and jumbled script that leaves for a somewhat confusing watch.\n\nThe film begins with an interview between Madoff and the subsequent author of his unofficial biography. He begins telling the story at the end of the meltdown on the eve of his arrest and starts from there. From here on out, we're told the story in chunks and pieces, from one perspective to another and totally abandons all formality regarding coherent storytelling. Instead, Levinson creates a deeply personal character study that paints Madoff as a sociopath and a white collar criminal mastermind who would rather blame the victim than himself. While it is engrossing to see De Niro as Madoff, it is barely enough to sustain its bloated runtime.\n\nThe film is engrossing to watch. There's no denying it but as the minutes ticked by, it all started to feel redundant. It was more so just dragging the entire Madoff family through hell for the remaining hour of the film and it becomes exhausting after awhile. In a way it was very much a Greek tragedy of epic proportions that just didn't seem to end and by the time it decided it wanted to, you were already checked out 10 minutes prior. Despite this, the ending is satisfying for those wanting to see karma at its best or a tragedy at its worst, whatever way you want to look at it.\n\nOverall, The Wizard of Lies is a missed opportunity more so than not. While it is great to see De Niro and Pfeiffer in top forms, it would have been nice to get a more coherent script from a story that literally writes itself. While anyone expecting a film in the vein of The Big Short will be let down by this, The Wizard of Lies benefits from being a deep character study that shines a (small) light of one of the most tragic mysteries of the 2008 financial crisis.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24376,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-20","keywords":"financial fraud,financier,ponzi scheme,fraudster,fraud","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tonight 8/7c","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi42121497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005273/","name":"Alessandro Nivola"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001469/","name":"Barry Levinson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063961/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506094/","name":"Sam Levinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2331718/","name":"John Burnham Schwartz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345603/","name":"Samuel Baum"],"duration":"PT2H13M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In almost every movie, every TV series, there are at least one or two characters that don't fit or are poorly portrayed. Not so here. I simply cannot find fault with the performances of the entire cast. Stellar! The sets, the direction, the camera work, the intensity all fit together seamlessly. This is a story of a good world...gone very wrong. This is a story about faith, twisted by evil intent, then thrust upon the common people. For me it is truly horrifying. I'm sorry I can't find better words to describe how this show affects me. I will say this: My daughter is currently attending university in the U.S. and I can tell you I fear for her safety every hour of every day. Not because this story is happening now...but because it is so close.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":208725,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-04-26","keywords":"rape,dystopia,violence against women,slavery,torture","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005253/","name":"Elisabeth Moss"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2088803/","name":"Yvonne Strahovski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001212/","name":"Joseph Fiennes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071026/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108881/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588005/","name":"Bruce Miller"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2726412313","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljMGNkYTMtMzE3MS00ZjM2LThjY2ItM2Q5YTVhYmI0ZmEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljMGNkYTMtMzE3MS00ZjM2LThjY2ItM2Q5YTVhYmI0ZmEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"Freedom is just the beginning.

Seeing it, there are no regrets watching it but at the same time it was a little frustrating. It is an interesting and decent film, but had real potential to be a great one and could have been much more.\n\nMatt Damon is a charismatic presence and commands the film with ease without ever trying too hard. Emily Blunt has a genuine winning charm as one often finds with Blunt, her character is not quite as interesting as Damon's but Blunt makes it work. The two have great chemistry together, it really sparkles. In fact it is the romance that comes off the best and most consistently, being where 'The Adjustment Bureau' really comes alive. Anthony Mackie is suitably mysterious while also quite likable in the film's latter stages.\n\nJohn Slattery really looks the part and has a lot of fun in a suitably shady role while Terence Stamp brings some sinister dignity and authority to a rather severely underwritten character that appears in the film too late somewhat. On the acting front, 'The Adjustment Bureau' is very good.\n\nAs it is too with the way it's made, suitably gritty and slick with some inventive moments and an audacious style. The locations are chosen well and used cleverly. The music score has a good mix of understatement and thrilling pulsation. The first half has a lot of very interesting and smart ideas that leaves one gripped enough to carry on and see further how it goes and there is a good deal of fun and a few suspenseful jolts to be had.\n\nFor all those great things, 'The Adjustment Bureau' would have been an even better film if it had done more with the premise. The romance is the most well done and memorable element of it and the rest doesn't live up. It's intriguing and entertaining, but the second half suffers from playing it too safe and having too many ideas needing to be tied up, meaning that potentially great ideas are not fully expanded upon (even the whole basic premise doesn't feel fully cooked).\n\nPacing does get stodgy, as a result of the lack of risk-taking and struggles with keeping things probable and consistent. Despite the conflict being well performed the threat feels lacking because it is handled in a way that's under-cooked and somewhat repetitive which dilutes the suspense quite badly. The more under-explored 'The Adjustment Bureau' gets, the more confusing, tonally muddled and far-fetched it gets too. This is especially true with the ending, which to me is down there with the decade's "what the heck" film endings.\n\nOverall, has a lot to recommend but there was a lot more to the film that never fully emerged. 6/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":252397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Romance","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-03-16","keywords":"fate,free will,political superpower,new york,usa","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Adjustment Bureau -- Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2215418393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MTE3ODMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE4MTQyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MTE3ODMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE4MTQyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Adjustment Bureau -- Super Bowl Spot\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1289434/","name":"Emily Blunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2564974/","name":"Lisa Thoreson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1079776/","name":"George Nolfi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0194736/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177587/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1079776/","name":"George Nolfi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001140/","name":"Philip K.

Incredible? No, but Very Good. And it washes the bad taste left in my mouth from Indiana Jones and the Big Letdown. The story is good, the acting is awesome. Ed Norton is the perfect person to play the tormented Bruce Banner. He is more believable in the roll than Eric Bana. Liv Tyler is very good as Betty Ross (formally played by the tasty Jennifer Connelly) William Hurt as General Ross is impressive and makes for a worthy adversary to Bruce Banner. If I had to come up with a negative, it would be Tim Roth. While I really like him, and he always plays great villains, I feel he's just miss cast here. He seems tiny next to General Ross. Instead of coming off like the English bad ass special op he's supposed to be, he comes off more like a jerk with Napoleon Syndrome. Someone more physically imposing like Vinnie Jones (Bullet tooth from Snatch), or Daniel Craig (the new Bond) would have been more convincing for the part. But I'm just picking here. The movie is a joy. Great action. No long boring, dragging development stuff that the first Hulk had in spades. There are some very nice cameos as well. Some were a surprise, some were not. I didn't see Nick Fury anywhere except in a brief headline in a montage. However I did not remain through the credits, so there might have been a scene at the end like Iron Man that I don't know about. I give it ***1/2 out of ****. I also predict it to make 80+million this weekend when it opens to the public and should "Hulk Smash" the competition. The movie received an ovation from the audience at the end which sums it up. A worthy movie made for the fans and everyone else."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":463386,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2008-06-18","keywords":"marvel cinematic universe,based on comic,bruce banner character,the incredible hulk character,reboot of series","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Incredible Hulk: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1726152985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second trailer for The Incredible Hulk, directed by Louis Leterrier."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000239/","name":"Liv Tyler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504642/","name":"Louis Leterrier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672015/","name":"Zak Penn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456158/","name":"Jack Kirby"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Incredible? No, but Very Good. And it washes the bad taste left in my mouth from Indiana Jones and the Big Letdown. The story is good, the acting is awesome. Ed Norton is the perfect person to play the tormented Bruce Banner. He is more believable in the roll than Eric Bana. Liv Tyler is very good as Betty Ross (formally played by the tasty Jennifer Connelly) William Hurt as General Ross is impressive and makes for a worthy adversary to Bruce Banner. If I had to come up with a negative, it would be Tim Roth. While I really like him, and he always plays great villains, I feel he's just miss cast here. He seems tiny next to General Ross. Instead of coming off like the English bad ass special op he's supposed to be, he comes off more like a jerk with Napoleon Syndrome. Someone more physically imposing like Vinnie Jones (Bullet tooth from Snatch), or Daniel Craig (the new Bond) would have been more convincing for the part. But I'm just picking here. The movie is a joy. Great action. No long boring, dragging development stuff that the first Hulk had in spades. There are some very nice cameos as well. Some were a surprise, some were not. I didn't see Nick Fury anywhere except in a brief headline in a montage. However I did not remain through the credits, so there might have been a scene at the end like Iron Man that I don't know about. I give it ***1/2 out of ****. I also predict it to make 80+million this weekend when it opens to the public and should "Hulk Smash" the competition. The movie received an ovation from the audience at the end which sums it up. A worthy movie made for the fans and everyone else.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":463386,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2008-06-18","keywords":"marvel cinematic universe,based on comic,bruce banner character,the incredible hulk character,reboot of series","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Incredible Hulk: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1726152985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second trailer for The Incredible Hulk, directed by Louis Leterrier.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000239/","name":"Liv Tyler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504642/","name":"Louis Leterrier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672015/","name":"Zak Penn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456158/","name":"Jack Kirby"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
