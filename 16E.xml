To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":318968,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I have seen this movie several times, and still enjoy it. Although i find Christopher Lambert a mediocre actor in most of his films, i feel that he shines here (a good idea to let him speak in his native French accent, cleverly written into the script by means of the Belgian explorer who finds him)instead of making him put on a bizarre accent, and it works well. Ian Holm and Ralph Richardson are fantastic and moving, but McDowell spoils it again and most of her scenes are irritating to watch. Some of this movie was actually quite upsetting (the taxidermy labs and the scene where the ape/father is shot) but very well done. The scenery is fantastic, and the musical score is brilliant and stirring. Great make-up effects for its day. This movie is well worth watching, give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19641,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1984-03-30","keywords":"year 1885,shipwreck,africa,ape,orphan","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1200997145","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjg3NWI4MmUtY2UzOC00OWUxLTk5MTYtMzNkYzc2MGQyMzU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjg3NWI4MmUtY2UzOC00OWUxLTk5MTYtMzNkYzc2MGQyMzU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A missing heir of respected Scottish family, raised in African jungles by animals, finally returns to his estate only to realize that difference between the two worlds is really significant."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000483/","name":"Christopher Lambert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000510/","name":"Andie MacDowell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0724732/","name":"Ralph Richardson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0399853/","name":"Hugh Hudson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0128312/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043388/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123194/","name":"Edgar Rice Burroughs"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001801/","name":"Robert Towne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0042472/","name":"Michael Austin"}],"duration":"PT2H23M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I have seen this movie several times, and still enjoy it. Although i find Christopher Lambert a mediocre actor in most of his films, i feel that he shines here (a good idea to let him speak in his native French accent, cleverly written into the script by means of the Belgian explorer who finds him)instead of making him put on a bizarre accent, and it works well. Ian Holm and Ralph Richardson are fantastic and moving, but McDowell spoils it again and most of her scenes are irritating to watch. Some of this movie was actually quite upsetting (the taxidermy labs and the scene where the ape/father is shot) but very well done. The scenery is fantastic, and the musical score is brilliant and stirring. Great make-up effects for its day. This movie is well worth watching, give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19641,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1984-03-30","keywords":"year 1885,shipwreck,africa,ape,orphan","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1200997145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjg3NWI4MmUtY2UzOC00OWUxLTk5MTYtMzNkYzc2MGQyMzU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjg3NWI4MmUtY2UzOC00OWUxLTk5MTYtMzNkYzc2MGQyMzU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A missing heir of respected Scottish family, raised in African jungles by animals, finally returns to his estate only to realize that difference between the two worlds is really significant.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000483/","name":"Christopher Lambert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000510/","name":"Andie MacDowell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0724732/","name":"Ralph Richardson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0399853/","name":"Hugh Hudson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0128312/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043388/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123194/","name":"Edgar Rice Burroughs","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001801/","name":"Robert Towne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0042472/","name":"Michael Austin"],"duration":"PT2H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

To sum it up, it was pretty damn good! Chad Michael Murray was pretty good, I thought he was going to be another Chris Flynn from Wrong Turn but I was wrong. Elisha Cuthbert was also good but the best performance has to go to Brian Van Holt. He played the bad guy too well, I mean he was sick, sadistic, and very cruel. The back story between the brothers was good, plus I liked how no killings took place until about 40 minutes into the film. It gave you time to pick the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die. Jon Abrahams was pretty good as the goofy best bud of CMM. I liked how Chad kind of cried when he found him dead, it was better then just him being like, "Whatever, my buddy is dead, who cares". It showed how he really cared.

No, probably not.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119428,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2001-08-31","keywords":"demon,wings,record player,eaten alive,scarecrow","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi10009113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmExZThlMDUtODMzNC00Mjc0LThhYWUtMTZkYTcxYzVjMDI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmExZThlMDUtODMzNC00Mjc0LThhYWUtMTZkYTcxYzVjMDI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005312/","name":"Gina Philips","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0519043/","name":"Justin Long","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0106534/","name":"Jonathan Breck"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0759207/","name":"Victor Salva"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020958/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092605/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0759207/","name":"Victor Salva"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Her acting is the worst.\n\nThe screenplay is just clown shoes. But the real highlight of this thing is the "ship". It looks like a carrack without sails, but wheels instead. It moves forward by means of ... erm, nobody knows. At the very least, they should have lamp-shaded it. But no.\n\nThis thing is only a 2/10 because the dragon special effects are somewhat decent. Somewhat. Otherwise it would be a 1/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4398,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2013-12-04","keywords":"downward spiral,dragon,revenge,harpooner,sword and sorcery","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Age Of The Dragons","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3116014873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMzY3MjMyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU5NjQ2NA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMzY3MjMyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU5NjQ2NA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Age Of The Dragons","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000418/","name":"Danny Glover","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005068/","name":"Vinnie Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0786417/","name":"Corey Sevier"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0514662/","name":"Ryan Little"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0111135/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076345/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011582/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1384611/","name":"McKay Daines","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2249135/","name":"Gil Aglaure","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1237224/","name":"Anne K.

Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) meet in Bloomingdales when they both want to purchase the same pair of gloves.  The attraction is instant and they spend a romantic evening cavorting around New York City together.  At the end of the evening John wants to see her again, but Sara decides that if it is fate that they should be together, they will find each other again.  She drives away in a cab and he never sees her again.   Well, almost never.\n\nYears go by and both of them are about to be married, but each still has this nagging feeling that the other was his/her one true love.  Of course fate conspires to bring them back together (after about a dozen near misses) as they each simultaneously undertake one last attempt to find one another just before they get married to someone else.\n\nThe fate angle is plowed mercilessly, almost to the point of nausea, but the skits are funny and the chemistry between Cusack and Beckinsale is enchanting.  Cusack is an expert at playing the tortured and neurotic lover, but here he is more haunted and forlorn than dysfunctional, and it plays much better than his previous two characters in `High Fidelity' and `America's Sweethearts'.  \n\nKate Beckinsale rocketed from obscurity to prominence with her performance in `Pearl Harbor' and proves to be a wonderful romantic lead in this film. She is breezy and adorable and spins a delightful web around Jonathan and the viewer.  The film also benefits from outstanding comedic support from Jeremy Piven as Jonathan's best friend and devoted Sara sleuth.  Piven's zany comedy proves to be the perfect complement to Cusack's wry despondency. Eugene Levy is a scream as the eccentric Bloomingdales salesman, who blackmails Jonathan into buying half the store to give him information from Sara's charge account.\n\nAll in all, this is an entertaining comedy that is insubstantial but delectable.  I tend to give romantic comedies a little more slack, because I'm a sucker for this slush, and this is one of the better ones I've seen in a while so I rated it a 9/10.  This lighthearted romp makes a great date flick, but if serious drama is your preference stay away.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":108126,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2002-04-03","keywords":"fate,destiny,serendipity,christmas,coincidence","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Serendipity","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi735092249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc5NjEwNDYtZTM4ZS00OWRiLTlmZWMtYjljODgwOWQxNjkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc5NjEwNDYtZTM4ZS00OWRiLTlmZWMtYjljODgwOWQxNjkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #3"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000131/","name":"John Cusack"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000295/","name":"Kate Beckinsale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005315/","name":"Jeremy Piven"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0155093/","name":"Peter Chelsom"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0018522/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044742/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458884/","name":"Marc Klein"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) meet in Bloomingdales when they both want to purchase the same pair of gloves.  The attraction is instant and they spend a romantic evening cavorting around New York City together.  At the end of the evening John wants to see her again, but Sara decides that if it is fate that they should be together, they will find each other again.  She drives away in a cab and he never sees her again.   Well, almost never.\n\nYears go by and both of them are about to be married, but each still has this nagging feeling that the other was his/her one true love.  Of course fate conspires to bring them back together (after about a dozen near misses) as they each simultaneously undertake one last attempt to find one another just before they get married to someone else.\n\nThe fate angle is plowed mercilessly, almost to the point of nausea, but the skits are funny and the chemistry between Cusack and Beckinsale is enchanting.  Cusack is an expert at playing the tortured and neurotic lover, but here he is more haunted and forlorn than dysfunctional, and it plays much better than his previous two characters in `High Fidelity' and `America's Sweethearts'.  \n\nKate Beckinsale rocketed from obscurity to prominence with her performance in `Pearl Harbor' and proves to be a wonderful romantic lead in this film. She is breezy and adorable and spins a delightful web around Jonathan and the viewer.  The film also benefits from outstanding comedic support from Jeremy Piven as Jonathan's best friend and devoted Sara sleuth.  Piven's zany comedy proves to be the perfect complement to Cusack's wry despondency. Eugene Levy is a scream as the eccentric Bloomingdales salesman, who blackmails Jonathan into buying half the store to give him information from Sara's charge account.\n\nAll in all, this is an entertaining comedy that is insubstantial but delectable.  I tend to give romantic comedies a little more slack, because I'm a sucker for this slush, and this is one of the better ones I've seen in a while so I rated it a 9/10.  This lighthearted romp makes a great date flick, but if serious drama is your preference stay away.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":108126,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2002-04-03","keywords":"fate,destiny,serendipity,christmas,coincidence","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Serendipity","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi735092249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc5NjEwNDYtZTM4ZS00OWRiLTlmZWMtYjljODgwOWQxNjkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc5NjEwNDYtZTM4ZS00OWRiLTlmZWMtYjljODgwOWQxNjkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #3","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000131/","name":"John Cusack","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000295/","name":"Kate Beckinsale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005315/","name":"Jeremy Piven"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0155093/","name":"Peter Chelsom"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0018522/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044742/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458884/","name":"Marc Klein"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Daniel's mother has visions of a new start, a new life with the sky as the limit.  Daniel, however, quickly finds that, for him, the West Coast holds nothing but hard times.\n\nWith the comforts of his rough, middle-class neighborhood thousands of miles away, Daniel tries to make friends and blend with the well-to-do, upper-class kids in his new home.  At first, Daniel seems to do alright but, before long, he crosses paths with Johnny (William Zabka), the tough, rich leader of a group of karate students who attends Daniel's new school.  To make matters worse, Johnny is the ex-boyfriend of Ali (Elisabeth Shue), a girl Daniel is pursuing.\n\nEnter Miyagi (Noriyuki "Pat" Morita), an aging handy-man who works at Daniel's apartment building.  Struggling for friends and failing to fit in, Daniel finds support in Miyagi.  After enduring several beatings at the hands of Johnny and his gang, Daniel comes to learn that Miyagi, in fact, knows karate.  Following a vain attempt to speak with Johnny's karate teacher (Martin Kove) about being left alone, Daniel is suddenly entered into the All-Valley Karate Tournament, where he will attempt to win the respect that Johnny and his gang have taken.\n\nAs he trains for the karate tournament with Miyagi, Daniel learns invaluable lessons about life and love.  And brought to the foreground of this karate story is Daniel's pursuit of Ali, who truly is the single person who gave the new kid a chance.\n\nOn many levels, "The Karate Kid" is an uplifting movie.  It illustrates how a lonely, out-of-place kid triumphs against the odds, and the movie doesn't need computer-animation or special effects to get its story across.  But, for me and anyone who loves '80s movies, the "The Karate Kid" has to be appreciated for its nostalgia trip back to "better times."

Daniel's mother has visions of a new start, a new life with the sky as the limit.  Daniel, however, quickly finds that, for him, the West Coast holds nothing but hard times.\n\nWith the comforts of his rough, middle-class neighborhood thousands of miles away, Daniel tries to make friends and blend with the well-to-do, upper-class kids in his new home.  At first, Daniel seems to do alright but, before long, he crosses paths with Johnny (William Zabka), the tough, rich leader of a group of karate students who attends Daniel's new school.  To make matters worse, Johnny is the ex-boyfriend of Ali (Elisabeth Shue), a girl Daniel is pursuing.\n\nEnter Miyagi (Noriyuki "Pat" Morita), an aging handy-man who works at Daniel's apartment building.  Struggling for friends and failing to fit in, Daniel finds support in Miyagi.  After enduring several beatings at the hands of Johnny and his gang, Daniel comes to learn that Miyagi, in fact, knows karate.  Following a vain attempt to speak with Johnny's karate teacher (Martin Kove) about being left alone, Daniel is suddenly entered into the All-Valley Karate Tournament, where he will attempt to win the respect that Johnny and his gang have taken.\n\nAs he trains for the karate tournament with Miyagi, Daniel learns invaluable lessons about life and love.  And brought to the foreground of this karate story is Daniel's pursuit of Ali, who truly is the single person who gave the new kid a chance.\n\nOn many levels, "The Karate Kid" is an uplifting movie.  It illustrates how a lonely, out-of-place kid triumphs against the odds, and the movie doesn't need computer-animation or special effects to get its story across.  But, for me and anyone who loves '80s movies, the "The Karate Kid" has to be appreciated for its nostalgia trip back to "better times."  For that reason alone, this movie is a classic.\n\nI've enjoyed few movies, if any, more than "The Karate Kid."  I highly recommend this flick to anyone who loves a touching, uplifting story, or to anyone who simply can't get out of the '80s!!!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":209048,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"1984-06-22","keywords":"karate,teenager,training,martial arts,bonsai","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Karate Kid","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi813087257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU0YTU1MTQtMjM5OC00Yzg1LWFmOWQtYjFkOTJkYWRiMTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU0YTU1MTQtMjM5OC00Yzg1LWFmOWQtYjFkOTJkYWRiMTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001494/","name":"Ralph Macchio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001552/","name":"Pat Morita","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000223/","name":"Elisabeth Shue"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

It wouldn't be that, if it wasn't so over the top trying to be funny. On the other hand I do admire, that German movie makers at last try to come out having gut to go better ways. The main problem with Germans movie business is, that they always try to do a movie that has a deeper meaning - and then the movies become boring, except those movies about the second world war.

Having my ear so close to cinema I know for sure that there is always one or two war films floating around in the projection booths, but people are making somewhat of a big deal out of Fury, so I suppose the reel question is will this be a Flag For Our Fathers or will it make us wish for Apocalypse Now?\n\nSo lets get this out of the way now. Fury isn't as good as Saving Private Ryan, but then I don't think it ever meant to be, comparing the two movies is like saying that Saun Of The Dead isn't as good as The Book Of Eli, just because both films has similarities (in as much as they are set at the end of the world) doesn't mean they are anything alike. These are two films that are near logger heads with each other.\n\nYou see Fury is contained, and given an almost claustrophobic feel to it, the entire film is either inside or at close proximity of the tank that Collier commands. This gives the movie a focus, and a focal point. We are never given a rest from the tank and it's enforcing nature, we are given no repreave from it, just like the men themselves, we are trapped in a steel giant that is only purpose is to kill people.\n\nTo say that Fury is bloodthirsty would be an understatement, actually that's not fair for me to say. Fury doesn't enjoy itself in gore, it only tries to give us an accurate portrayal of what it must have been like for those brave men and women who faced death on a daily basis.\n\nThat's what David Ayer does really well, he controls his audience. In the opening scene we are shown Collier (Brad Pitt) ambushing and attacking a German officer, it is crude and desperate and over quickly but we can tell even then that is a man who cannot cope with the horrors he has had to endure.\n\nLooking back there are so many moments in Fury that stand out as impressive. There is a single second where Collier shows his true emotions and it is incredible to view. Collier is a man who is forced to be a hero, he never chooses it, he wants only to survive this war.\n\nAny war film can be impressive in it's action sequences, anyone can make loud noises and explosions and fighting, but if a war film can still shock and grip and captivate you in the slower periods, in the silences, that's when you know for sure you have an outstanding movie, and that is what happens with Fury.\n\nLike all war movies, Fury ultimately builds to a climatic finale and truly I think it's one of the best I've ever seen, not because of the action or it's quality of visuals but because we have invested too much into the characters we have seen on screen.\n\nThe film of course would be nothing without the men inside the tank, those being Brad Pitt (who helms the best), Shia LaBouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal. With these men there is no star, or main character, outside the tank the two leads are Logan Lerman (Who plays the new recruit) and Brad Pitt, however once we are inside the tank all men are equals, and dare I say it, but Shai LaBouf is actually quite good in his role. It's also always nice to see Jason Issacs on screen (hello to you).\n\nFury is a poignant and painful reminder of how much war can take from each of us, it is a film that never wants us to relax and we never do. Gory and gripping, Fury deserves a high spot in the history of war movies.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":452185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2014-10-22","keywords":"battle,tank,battlefield,world war two,combat","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1850190873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxODA4ODIxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2MDcxMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxODA4ODIxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2MDcxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"April, 1945.

Having my ear so close to cinema I know for sure that there is always one or two war films floating around in the projection booths, but people are making somewhat of a big deal out of Fury, so I suppose the reel question is will this be a Flag For Our Fathers or will it make us wish for Apocalypse Now?\n\nSo lets get this out of the way now. Fury isn't as good as Saving Private Ryan, but then I don't think it ever meant to be, comparing the two movies is like saying that Saun Of The Dead isn't as good as The Book Of Eli, just because both films has similarities (in as much as they are set at the end of the world) doesn't mean they are anything alike. These are two films that are near logger heads with each other.\n\nYou see Fury is contained, and given an almost claustrophobic feel to it, the entire film is either inside or at close proximity of the tank that Collier commands. This gives the movie a focus, and a focal point. We are never given a rest from the tank and it's enforcing nature, we are given no repreave from it, just like the men themselves, we are trapped in a steel giant that is only purpose is to kill people.\n\nTo say that Fury is bloodthirsty would be an understatement, actually that's not fair for me to say. Fury doesn't enjoy itself in gore, it only tries to give us an accurate portrayal of what it must have been like for those brave men and women who faced death on a daily basis.\n\nThat's what David Ayer does really well, he controls his audience. In the opening scene we are shown Collier (Brad Pitt) ambushing and attacking a German officer, it is crude and desperate and over quickly but we can tell even then that is a man who cannot cope with the horrors he has had to endure.\n\nLooking back there are so many moments in Fury that stand out as impressive. There is a single second where Collier shows his true emotions and it is incredible to view. Collier is a man who is forced to be a hero, he never chooses it, he wants only to survive this war.\n\nAny war film can be impressive in it's action sequences, anyone can make loud noises and explosions and fighting, but if a war film can still shock and grip and captivate you in the slower periods, in the silences, that's when you know for sure you have an outstanding movie, and that is what happens with Fury.\n\nLike all war movies, Fury ultimately builds to a climatic finale and truly I think it's one of the best I've ever seen, not because of the action or it's quality of visuals but because we have invested too much into the characters we have seen on screen.\n\nThe film of course would be nothing without the men inside the tank, those being Brad Pitt (who helms the best), Shia LaBouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal. With these men there is no star, or main character, outside the tank the two leads are Logan Lerman (Who plays the new recruit) and Brad Pitt, however once we are inside the tank all men are equals, and dare I say it, but Shai LaBouf is actually quite good in his role. It's also always nice to see Jason Issacs on screen (hello to you).\n\nFury is a poignant and painful reminder of how much war can take from each of us, it is a film that never wants us to relax and we never do. Gory and gripping, Fury deserves a high spot in the history of war movies.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":452185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2014-10-22","keywords":"battle,tank,battlefield,world war two,combat","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1850190873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxODA4ODIxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2MDcxMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxODA4ODIxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2MDcxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"April, 1945.

Great acting, too!","reviewBody":"The Life of David Gale (2003)\n\nWhether you are pro or anti death penalty, there's not getting past the sensational, brave, and maybe insane elements of this story. Based on fact about a death row inmate who had been famous as a death row protester, the core of the movie is how a young reporter (a convincing Kate Winslet) interviews the inmate (an equally convincing Kevin Spacey) in the days before his scheduled execution. We are gradually shown the backstory through their interviews, and another story builds as the reporter chases down new leads, including missing video evidence. Laura Linney plays an important third lead that starts to throw doubts into everyone's mind, including the audience's.\n\nAll of this sounds like a great movie should have come out of it: superb casting and acting, a great story with believable but astounding twists, and a nice tight framework, day by day, with methodical flashbacks. Instead the movie both tries too hard and fumbles some of the key moments. What is clearly dramatic is sometimes made over-dramatic (Winslet running and running and running, or words like "innocent" spinning across the screen between scenes). Other sensationalist add-ons make the movie cheap (seeing a chaingang neatly working along the road just as they drive by). And simple reactions aren't believable (they way characters respond to someone following them, or to other threats). This is important stuff for a movie trying to recreate the truth. \n\nBy my guess, the director is the key suspect, though he has a raft of successful films behind him, including the closest echo, Midnight Express (1978), which is about injustice and a prisoner who is extraordinary. But in all his films (that I've seen, which is quite a few, it turns out), there is a feeling of powerful story line carrying the day (Mississippi Burning, Birdy). Parker has also made a series of films tied to contemporary music, from Evita which is fair to The Commitments which is terrific fun, as well as The Wall, which might be his best film in all, though a difficult one. All of these films have a great setting, either musically or geographically.\n\nHere we have only the dull backdrop of conservative Texas (if that's not redundant). And a blazing, heartwrenching story. Which is fair enough as a start. The Life of David Gale is a powerful morality tale, most of all, with some great acting, and many or most people watching will be glad they saw it. All those little flaws fade further and further as you get toward the end.\n\nAnd then the end, the famous big final twist. That's memorable stuff.

I hope the next projects will be less hectic and over-excited, but better - in a new way.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5440,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-10-26","keywords":"singing in a car,female teacher,teacher student relationship,teacher student conflict,munich germany","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4153260825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBhZGNlYTctYmYxYi00YmU2LTlhMDItN2E0ZjRjNzU4NmNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBhZGNlYTctYmYxYi00YmU2LTlhMDItN2E0ZjRjNzU4NmNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065929/","name":"Elyas M'Barek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0726257/","name":"Katja Riemann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3436464/","name":"Jella Haase"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1480916/","name":"Bora Dagtekin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1480916/","name":"Bora Dagtekin"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Every now and then movies come along that speak out to you and emotionally touch you in some way. Amelie is one such film for me. I related to its innocent charm and delightfully shy protagonist played by French sensation Audrey Tautou, the way very few films have. Part of the reason we watch movies is to learn something about ourselves or recognize characters that are remarkably similar to us and the way we are in real life. For all of us shy, introverted, quirky, and odd-ball eccentrics out there who have trouble relating to "normal" people, Audrey Tautou in this film is our personal hero. Instead of going into much detail about why the film works, I'll instead try to explain what it meant to me personally. Sure I guess this means I have to open up maybe more than I'd like to about myself, but oh well. The way Amelie's childhood was presented is similar to my own. I am an only child to divorced parents and very rarely had friends as I was and still am very much a loner. As a child much of my time was spent alone so I entertained myself in all kinds of silly ways. Just like Amelie does in the film. Of course I gained my fixation with films at an extremely early age, but also did stupid things like give my stuffed animals personalities and have conversations with them, draw pictures and create stories to go along with them, and laid in bed listening to the radio with the windows open on a lazy summer day imagining creatures out of the cloud formations. Apparently there are legions of us out there. Even today I enjoy solitude far more than the company of most people and still use my imagination to think of stupid little things. Amelie did an amazing job in capturing what the world is like through the eyes of a person who doesn't really fit in, but finds joy in the simple things in life. Like the fresh spring breeze on your face, the sound of the rain, the chirping of birds, the touch of fur, and popping bubble wrap. Actually popping bubble wrap was always an exciting and rare treat during my youth. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film also has a marvelously fun nifty view of sex. For Amelie sex is not something that is intimidating, temptingly desirable, sinful, adult, or lustful. It's just another of the many silly things that people do in this world that make us human. Two people taking off their cloths and rubbing up against one another. How sweet! In fact many people have insulted the film for it's unique view and open attitude towards sex. For shame really. Sure there's a lot of it actually. Amelie's first sexual encounter, the orgasms, the object of her affection working in a porn shop with a stripper and putting price tags on didoes. But it's all in good fun and filmed with the naivety that a character like Amelie would view sex as. Anyways the movie really works. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel does an excellent job in filming Jeunet's crazy vision and Audrey Tautou with her funky hairdo, wide brown eyes, and whimsical voice and kitten like mannerisms and shyness brings the movie to life. As I said I relate to this movie and understand the character the way I do with few other movies simply because it is frighteningly very much like I tend to be in real life. \n\n"You mean she would rather imagine herself relating to an absent person than build relationships with those around her?"\n\nHmm, so would I sometimes. Audrey Tautou's been a more reliable friend than most people and has put a smile on my face and lightened my day at the thought of her more times than one. And I still say I'll marry her one day.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":726869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-04-25","keywords":"female protagonist,voice over narration,paris france,france,montmartre paris","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1406515737","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTc2ODQwNTEtNjk1ZS00Y2MwLTk4OWQtZWQ1OGYxYjI0MmM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTc2ODQwNTEtNjk1ZS00Y2MwLTk4OWQtZWQ1OGYxYjI0MmM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440913/","name":"Mathieu Kassovitz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749363/","name":"Rufus"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0125555/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069524/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072800/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0491011/","name":"Guillaume Laurant"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Three young men were convicted of killing three small children and much of the evidence presented in court was testimony that the alleged perpetrators were young, listened to heavy metal music and had an interest in the occult...along with about 10,000,000 other teens at that time! The film talks a lot about the conflicting evidence, recanted testimony and holes in the case. And, it gives two other possible perpetrators who were never prosecuted. But, because the community was looking for convictions and because there was a strong cultural belief in the existence of satanic murder cults, folks seemed more than willing to see these three teens convicted and so they were.\n\nThe film does work very well in convincing the audience and providing an entertaining film. Your heart will certainly get caught up in the film and it will have a strong impact on viewers. The director, production staff and everyone associated with the film did quite well.

This came as a bit surprise. \n\nIf you are looking for a thorough examination of the killings, the folks involved and subsequent trial, this film may leave you a bit cold, unfortunately. For dramatic reasons, the film chose to focus on one particular mother (probably because she was played by Reese Witherspoon) and completely ignored the other two grieving families--a very, very odd omission to say the least and something that seems a bit offensive. If you are interested in all the details of the case, then see "Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills", "Paradise Lost 2: Revelations", and "Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory"—three documentaries about the infamous 'Memphis Three' directed by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky\n\nOverall, the movie is a good, well-constructed drama and a reasonably fair representation of the case--albeit far from a perfect one.

And, if you do watch, you might want to keep some Kleenex handy...it has a few gut-wrenching moments.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-03-12","keywords":"west memphis three,year 1993,angry mob,police interrogation,police investigation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4000688665","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU5ODM2ODc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzMDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU5ODM2ODc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzMDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The savage murders of three young children spark a controversial trial of three teenagers accused of killing the kids as part of a satanic ritual.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000702/","name":"Reese Witherspoon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005273/","name":"Alessandro Nivola"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000382/","name":"Atom Egoyan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001099/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0171732/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0090199/","name":"Paul Harris Boardman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0220600/","name":"Scott Derrickson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2268286/","name":"Mara Leveritt"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

My take on this is the subject matter cannot go in that many directions. You can find similarities in every films about choir boys. Heck even the hit cult French film "The Chorist is far from original and recycle story lines from films that came before it. In most of these films you will get a trouble boy or boys who gets his or their life changed by his or their new found love of singing. This film is no different and if you are aware of that before going into it you will see the good point of that film rather then the fact that it is a very familiar story. Young and troubled Stet (Garrett Wareing) is sent to a Choir school by his father he never met before (Stet is a secret son,the product of a one night stand) following the death of his junkie mother. Things start roughly as Stet is accepted via bribe by his father desperate to put his son somewhere so he can be back to his real family. This causes some students and teachers to only see Stet as a charity case with no real musical talent.However Stet determination pays off and the main teacher Mr Carvelle (Dustin Hoffman) finally start noticing that their might be more to the boy then meet the eye. So yes pretty straightforward story and yes it sound like a TV movie from lifetime but you know what it has a good heart and all the actors seems to really enjoy themselves. Kathy Bates as the overworked headmistress ,Eddy Izzard as a competitive teacher , Kevin McHale as the teacher who first notice Stet's talent along with Hoffman creates a very interesting dynamic and they breath life to the school. Garrett Wareing is easy to root for as Stet , he his misunderstood and a victim of his upbringing.The actor convey that sense of wanting to break free from the tag everybody has placed on him all his life and he convey a quiet sort of will power and maturity really well. The only thing that bothered me is Stet's relationship with his father felt rushed and underdeveloped and they wrapped this storyline conveniently.It is a shame as it was intriguing and it could have been explored a lot more. With that said , listen ! Yeah this films has received a lot of bad review for being too "Simple" but people who are interested in theses type of films should not be looking for "Interstellar" they should be looking for a sweet little heart warmer with excellent music and songs and this film do that!

Who cares?? The whole movie is a blast!!\n\nIlya Naishuller is a young director who had a very cool idea to shoot an action film from a first-person perspective using a GoPro Hero3 Black Edition camera. The proof of concept was released as "Biting Elbows: Bad Motherf***er". It was pitched publicly and helped to successfully crowd-fund the feature, 'Hardcore'.\n\nIt's better to keep this short and sweet: the film is extraordinarily violent; not for the squeamish. It has plenty of action, free-running, stunts, and plenty of room for comedic elements. Even the opening titles give you a taste of what's to come!\n\nSharlto Copley (District 9, and other Neill Blomkamp projects) plays the main POV's assistant throughout the film. Copley definitely gives a range of character performances and is quality. Wearing many hats, he guides you along as if you were needing assistance in a video game, which, by the way, this film makes several references to. In particular, the Chernobyl level in Call of Duty 4 with Capt. MacMillian. Even the opening scenes are reminiscent of Half-Life, and a lot of the free-running scenes are inspired by Mirror's Edge.\n\nFor those who are wondering, no.

Who cares?? The whole movie is a blast!!\n\nIlya Naishuller is a young director who had a very cool idea to shoot an action film from a first-person perspective using a GoPro Hero3 Black Edition camera. The proof of concept was released as "Biting Elbows: Bad Motherf***er". It was pitched publicly and helped to successfully crowd-fund the feature, 'Hardcore'.\n\nIt's better to keep this short and sweet: the film is extraordinarily violent; not for the squeamish. It has plenty of action, free-running, stunts, and plenty of room for comedic elements. Even the opening titles give you a taste of what's to come!\n\nSharlto Copley (District 9, and other Neill Blomkamp projects) plays the main POV's assistant throughout the film. Copley definitely gives a range of character performances and is quality. Wearing many hats, he guides you along as if you were needing assistance in a video game, which, by the way, this film makes several references to. In particular, the Chernobyl level in Call of Duty 4 with Capt. MacMillian. Even the opening scenes are reminiscent of Half-Life, and a lot of the free-running scenes are inspired by Mirror's Edge.\n\nFor those who are wondering, no. You likely won't get dizzy watching a 90-minute action film from an FP perspective. Well, maybe you shouldn't sit in the front row. Otherwise, you will have a blast.\n\n'Hardcore' is an all-around fun time. Just be okay with the violence. It's only 90 minutes of your time that you'll likely want to experience over and over again. Or, you'll just want to plug in a play a few games. \n\nEither way, it's bloody fun!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":91527,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-04-07","keywords":"point of view,cyborg,violence,telekinesis,moscow russia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3742872857","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5ODE2MDIxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI3NzUyODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5ODE2MDIxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI3NzUyODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Hardcore Henry is an action film told from a first person perspective: You remember nothing.

One of my favourite songs was "In my Room" by Brian Wilson. Chasing Mavericks deals with people coming to terms with massive gaps in their lives but somehow focusing on something bigger than themselves to pull through. If you love surfing or the ocean, this movie is for you. Mavericks was brought to world wide attention with Stacey Peralta's film "Riding Giants". Jay has lost his father early in life, and has to act as a pseudo parent for his mother who suffers from the breakup. He accidentally discovers that his much older neighbour Frosty is a big wave surfer and so a teacher mentor relationship starts. Frosty, as well, has terrible father issues which continue to plague him. Their relationship develops momentum and gives each of them energy and purpose. The film underlines the choices we can make in life. Everyone has scars and issues to deal with. Do we give up and spiral downwards or do we set big goals (waves) and go after them. Jay plans carefully in his room to conquer his fears and reach his goal. Excellent and heartfelt acting.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31950,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2012-10-26","keywords":"bare chested male,briefs,white briefs,male underwear,tighty whities","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3341722905","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NDA5NjU1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA1MTQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NDA5NjU1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA1MTQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When 15-year-old Jay Moriarty discovers that the mythic Mavericks surf break, one of the biggest waves on Earth, is not only real, but exists just miles from his Santa Cruz home, he enlists the help of local legend Frosty Hesson to train him to survive it."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4103976/","name":"Jonny Weston"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000223/","name":"Elisabeth Shue"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000776/","name":"Michael Apted"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000436/","name":"Curtis Hanson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073388/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177687/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0758002/","name":"Kario Salem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2249435/","name":"Jim Meenaghan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393714/","name":"Brandon Hooper"}],"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One of my favourite songs was "In my Room" by Brian Wilson. Chasing Mavericks deals with people coming to terms with massive gaps in their lives but somehow focusing on something bigger than themselves to pull through. If you love surfing or the ocean, this movie is for you. Mavericks was brought to world wide attention with Stacey Peralta's film "Riding Giants". Jay has lost his father early in life, and has to act as a pseudo parent for his mother who suffers from the breakup. He accidentally discovers that his much older neighbour Frosty is a big wave surfer and so a teacher mentor relationship starts. Frosty, as well, has terrible father issues which continue to plague him. Their relationship develops momentum and gives each of them energy and purpose. The film underlines the choices we can make in life. Everyone has scars and issues to deal with. Do we give up and spiral downwards or do we set big goals (waves) and go after them. Jay plans carefully in his room to conquer his fears and reach his goal. Excellent and heartfelt acting.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31950,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2012-10-26","keywords":"bare chested male,briefs,white briefs,male underwear,tighty whities","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3341722905","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NDA5NjU1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA1MTQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NDA5NjU1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA1MTQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When 15-year-old Jay Moriarty discovers that the mythic Mavericks surf break, one of the biggest waves on Earth, is not only real, but exists just miles from his Santa Cruz home, he enlists the help of local legend Frosty Hesson to train him to survive it.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4103976/","name":"Jonny Weston","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000223/","name":"Elisabeth Shue"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000776/","name":"Michael Apted","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000436/","name":"Curtis Hanson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073388/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177687/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0758002/","name":"Kario Salem","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2249435/","name":"Jim Meenaghan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393714/","name":"Brandon Hooper"],"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

My initial reaction upon leaving the screening room was it was astonishing, a magnificent achievement that stands tall as one of the year's best movies. As the film continues to settle within my cinematic soul, this very well could be the best film of the year, anchored by a career best performance from the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch. \n\nFull disclosure, I'm fairly oblivious to European history and the heroes that had a hand in one of the deadliest wars in history. I've heard the name Alan Turing from high school and college but either didn't care enough to learn or have no recollection of his contributions. Minutes following the screening, Amazon.com got $15.82 from my bank account in order to read "Alan Turing: The Enigma," the book in which screenwriter Graham Moore based the story upon. Telling the story of Alan Turing, a mathematician who in 1939 led a pioneer in cracking one of the most difficult codes in history. His contributions paved the way for essentially the way we exist now. However, Turing, who is a homosexual, has to wrestle with his secret in order to keep his status and his work years later.\n\nMasterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum's film is both engrossing and disturbing. It has genius aspirations in which it wants to exist in the cinematic world. It's an impeccable thriller, taut and brilliant, exploring the horrors of war along with the choices that doom mankind for all eternity. Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic. Screenwriter Moore crafts a murky, dark, yet totally enjoyable spy film that stands taller than any James Bond film ever released. It's a sure-fire Oscar contender for several Academy Awards including Best Picture. They should feel so lucky to have the gumption to choose something this methodical and majestic.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch continues to climb the ladder as one of the best actors working today. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV's "Sherlock," this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. Oscar-winner or not, this will be looked upon like the greats such as Gene Hackman in The French Connection or any legendary 70's movie that you love today. Cumberbatch hones in on all of Turing's character flaws and good qualities that make him a real person. He constructs him from the toes up, inflicting mannerisms and behaviors that all ring true. He stimulates all the sensual beats that keep us fixated on a performance. I can't help but go back to someone like Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, who delivered a construction of epic proportions. Though based on a real person, the talented Cumberbatch ignites his own masterpiece performance. He follows the demons of Turing down to his bones. Unsure, arrogant, and dismissive to the world around him, Turing shows only what he must, what he chooses, and every once in a while, we get a front seat to his soul. Thank you Cumberbatch.\n\nThe rest of the cast is completely on their game. It's probably a contender for the SAG Ensemble prize. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley, as the feisty and fiery Joan Clark, is as loose and comfortable as I've ever seen her. She wears Joan like an old coat from the back of the closet. Remembering it fondly and seeing that it fits just perfect. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film. \n\nI don't know when it's going to happen but the world needs to make Matthew Goode a mega-star. In his brief time on-screen, Goode makes his mark, becoming essentially a co-anchor with Knightley of the supporting players, showcasing a reason to give this guy his own leading role sooner rather than later. As our resident sleazy authority figure, Charles Dance shows that he's still got it. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine.\n\nTechnical merits are no shortage of excellence on display. Oscar- winning Editor William Goldenberg (Argo) shows that tension is his second language. Cutting the film to perfection, and forcing your heart into throat, this espionage thriller succeeds for general audiences because of Goldenberg's efforts. It's something that anyone can seek out and get fully immersed into. Alexandre Desplat tacks another impressive composition to his already thick resume. With films like The Grand Budapest Hotel already in his arsenal, I assume this to be another Oscar citation in his future. Shot by the talented Oscar Faura, responsible for painting the canvas that was J.A. Bayona's The Impossible, he utilizes the standard brilliance of capturing a moment. Knows when to pull back and get close. Let's not forget the Production and Costume Design by Maria Djurkovic and Sammy Sheldon Differ. Those two will surely be mentioned for the rest of the film year.\n\nThe Imitation Game is assertive and makes a serious claim as one of the best spy thrillers ever made.

 --- Description: The Imitation Game: Directed by Morten Tyldum. With Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear.

My initial reaction upon leaving the screening room was it was astonishing, a magnificent achievement that stands tall as one of the year's best movies. As the film continues to settle within my cinematic soul, this very well could be the best film of the year, anchored by a career best performance from the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch. \n\nFull disclosure, I'm fairly oblivious to European history and the heroes that had a hand in one of the deadliest wars in history. I've heard the name Alan Turing from high school and college but either didn't care enough to learn or have no recollection of his contributions. Minutes following the screening, Amazon.com got $15.82 from my bank account in order to read "Alan Turing: The Enigma," the book in which screenwriter Graham Moore based the story upon. Telling the story of Alan Turing, a mathematician who in 1939 led a pioneer in cracking one of the most difficult codes in history. His contributions paved the way for essentially the way we exist now. However, Turing, who is a homosexual, has to wrestle with his secret in order to keep his status and his work years later.\n\nMasterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum's film is both engrossing and disturbing. It has genius aspirations in which it wants to exist in the cinematic world. It's an impeccable thriller, taut and brilliant, exploring the horrors of war along with the choices that doom mankind for all eternity. Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic. Screenwriter Moore crafts a murky, dark, yet totally enjoyable spy film that stands taller than any James Bond film ever released. It's a sure-fire Oscar contender for several Academy Awards including Best Picture. They should feel so lucky to have the gumption to choose something this methodical and majestic.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch continues to climb the ladder as one of the best actors working today. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV's "Sherlock," this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. Oscar-winner or not, this will be looked upon like the greats such as Gene Hackman in The French Connection or any legendary 70's movie that you love today. Cumberbatch hones in on all of Turing's character flaws and good qualities that make him a real person. He constructs him from the toes up, inflicting mannerisms and behaviors that all ring true. He stimulates all the sensual beats that keep us fixated on a performance. I can't help but go back to someone like Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, who delivered a construction of epic proportions. Though based on a real person, the talented Cumberbatch ignites his own masterpiece performance. He follows the demons of Turing down to his bones. Unsure, arrogant, and dismissive to the world around him, Turing shows only what he must, what he chooses, and every once in a while, we get a front seat to his soul. Thank you Cumberbatch.\n\nThe rest of the cast is completely on their game. It's probably a contender for the SAG Ensemble prize. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley, as the feisty and fiery Joan Clark, is as loose and comfortable as I've ever seen her. She wears Joan like an old coat from the back of the closet. Remembering it fondly and seeing that it fits just perfect. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film. \n\nI don't know when it's going to happen but the world needs to make Matthew Goode a mega-star. In his brief time on-screen, Goode makes his mark, becoming essentially a co-anchor with Knightley of the supporting players, showcasing a reason to give this guy his own leading role sooner rather than later. As our resident sleazy authority figure, Charles Dance shows that he's still got it. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine.\n\nTechnical merits are no shortage of excellence on display. Oscar- winning Editor William Goldenberg (Argo) shows that tension is his second language. Cutting the film to perfection, and forcing your heart into throat, this espionage thriller succeeds for general audiences because of Goldenberg's efforts. It's something that anyone can seek out and get fully immersed into. Alexandre Desplat tacks another impressive composition to his already thick resume. With films like The Grand Budapest Hotel already in his arsenal, I assume this to be another Oscar citation in his future. Shot by the talented Oscar Faura, responsible for painting the canvas that was J.A. Bayona's The Impossible, he utilizes the standard brilliance of capturing a moment. Knows when to pull back and get close. Let's not forget the Production and Costume Design by Maria Djurkovic and Sammy Sheldon Differ. Those two will surely be mentioned for the rest of the film year.\n\nThe Imitation Game is assertive and makes a serious claim as one of the best spy thrillers ever made. There are sub plots that all resonate and never feel forced. This will not only keep your tension level at a fever pitch but could leave you in tears to walk home with. It's a complete realistic view at the spy game that stands as one of the best films of the year and a performance for the ages from Benedict Cumberbatch. A captivating achievement that I'll likely remember for some time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":720004,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-01-07","keywords":"cryptography,world war two,enigma code,mathematician,closeted gay man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3398414105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzODk5OTY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU1NjUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzODk5OTY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU1NjUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on the real life story of legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing, the film portrays the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his brilliant team of code-breakers at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212722/","name":"Benedict Cumberbatch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0328828/","name":"Matthew Goode"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878763/","name":"Morten Tyldum"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0319513/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251858/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0457197/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2441699/","name":"Graham Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0388132/","name":"Andrew Hodges"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There is no humor, no suspense, and the acting is poor. I can't think of a single performer that impressed me - even Monae let me down this time.\n\nThe first 1/2 hour was strong but then it completely degenerated. The twist was interesting and probably the only thing of note that I took away from the viewing. And as important as the 'message' of the film was, it couldn't have been any more hamfisted in its delivery. Such a waste.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-09-18","keywords":"lipstick,offscreen suicide,slave,kidnapping,rape","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4212375065","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE2ODAxZTQtMGM1NC00NzVkLWEzYTYtOGE0ZGYxNTAyZWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE2ODAxZTQtMGM1NC00NzVkLWEzYTYtOGE0ZGYxNTAyZWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Successful author Veronica Henley finds herself trapped in a horrifying reality and must uncover the mind-bending mystery before its too late.\n\nStarring Janelle Monáe, Marque Richardson II, Eric Lange, Jack Huston, Kiersey Clemons, Tongayi Chirisa, Gabourey Sidibe, Rob Aramayo, Lily Cowles, and Jena Malone, the film is released August 21 in the US and the UK.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1847117/","name":"Janelle Monáe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1441925/","name":"Eric Lange","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0540441/","name":"Jena Malone"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4680113/","name":"Gerard Bush","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7896794/","name":"Christopher Renz"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0555595/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4680113/","name":"Gerard Bush","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7896794/","name":"Christopher Renz"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The humor is laugh-out-loud here, both through the dialogues and the visuals that is just magically delivered in a snappy screenplay of 90 minutes. The performances are the next highlight of the film, especially the sisters who played Diamantino's sisters on screen. Such beauty and sinister-ship they carry, you cannot take eyes off them when they are on the screen. But come to think of it, this is a film where you can't do it anyway because it's fun... absurdist, but just pure fun. The wit and wordplay is also very strong here. It will most importantly remind you of a real-life footballer who hails from the same country this film is set in...

The humor is laugh-out-loud here, both through the dialogues and the visuals that is just magically delivered in a snappy screenplay of 90 minutes. The performances are the next highlight of the film, especially the sisters who played Diamantino's sisters on screen. Such beauty and sinister-ship they carry, you cannot take eyes off them when they are on the screen. But come to think of it, this is a film where you can't do it anyway because it's fun... absurdist, but just pure fun. The wit and wordplay is also very strong here. It will most importantly remind you of a real-life footballer who hails from the same country this film is set in...

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66116,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-08-27","keywords":"stripper,premarital sex,sex standing up,sex scene,belgrade serbia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3721243673","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An ex-CIA operative is brought back in on a very personal mission and finds himself pitted against his former pupil in a deadly game involving high level CIA officials and the Russian president-elect.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3478396/","name":"Luke Bracey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1385871/","name":"Olga Kurylenko"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002044/","name":"Roger Donaldson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088199/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0500612/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3360218/","name":"Michael Finch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2244980/","name":"Karl Gajdusek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1952653/","name":"Bill Granger"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While "Slumdog Millionaire" is far from a Bollywood tragic love story filled with singing and dancing, the way director Danny Boyle will rivet audiences with his film that is authentic to Indian culture while using a distinctly Western style of film-making might be enough proof that there is a profit to be made here.\n\n"Slumdog Millionaire" is a drama exposing the tragic effects of poverty in gigantic Indian cities like Mumbai that is also fused with a modern day Indian fairytale. Jamal Malik is a young man on India's "Who Wants to Be A Millionaire" and is a question away from one million dollars when he's arrested on suspicion of cheating. Because Jamal is from the slums of India and has no educational background, it seems entirely improbable if not impossible that Jamal could make it this far, but each question is connected with distinct and sometimes painful memories for Jamal. It's as if he is destined to win, even though he only went on the show to impress a girl he has loved his whole life, Latika.\n\nDanny Boyle ("28 Days Later," "Sunshine") takes us from memory to memory as Jamal advances question by question toward the million dollars. These memories offer vivid insight into poverty in India as well as the lives of Jamal, Latika and Jamal's older brother Salim. As children they are left parentless and taught how to swindle tourists, leading to lives of little fulfillment or even corruption. Despite being separated, Jamal and Latika are reunited several times and in fact Jamal's only motivation in life is his love for her.\n\nWhile the young, unknown, Indian actors are absolutely amazing in this film, the biggest kudos go to director Boyle, who creates an astonishing film. For Boyle to go from science fiction and zombie thrillers to taking on a project as daring and unusual as "Slumdog Millionaire" proves that he's not only a brave director, but a versatile one. His great success with making this film intense, eye-opening and full of heart all at the same time prove that he's also an incredible one. "Slumdog" is just the beginning for Boyle who might be one of the most progressive and talented directors working today.\n\nIt's hard to be completely blown away by a film whose core message is about destiny and leans on the fact that Jamal is simply fated to do this well in explaining what has unfolded, but like any good film ought to, Boyle makes you a fan of the characters and not care as much about the logistics as you might normally do. The fact that this film starts out so dramatic and real makes it hard to embrace the fairytale it blossoms into, but it's the great visual storytelling along the way that makes it so enjoyable. \n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":819404,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-03-18","keywords":"papadum,murder,india,non professional cast,prostitute","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Slumdog Millionaire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2220163097","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of how impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik became a contestant on the Hindi version of "Who Wants to be A Millionaire?" -- an endeavor made in  an effort to prove his love for his friend Latika, who is an ardent fan of the show."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2353862/","name":"Dev Patel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795661/","name":"Saurabh Shukla"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0849164/","name":"Loveleen Tandan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152921/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064479/","name":"Simon Beaufoy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3139511/","name":"Vikas Swarup"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

These memories offer vivid insight into poverty in India as well as the lives of Jamal, Latika and Jamal's older brother Salim. As children they are left parentless and taught how to swindle tourists, leading to lives of little fulfillment or even corruption. Despite being separated, Jamal and Latika are reunited several times and in fact Jamal's only motivation in life is his love for her.\n\nWhile the young, unknown, Indian actors are absolutely amazing in this film, the biggest kudos go to director Boyle, who creates an astonishing film. For Boyle to go from science fiction and zombie thrillers to taking on a project as daring and unusual as "Slumdog Millionaire" proves that he's not only a brave director, but a versatile one. His great success with making this film intense, eye-opening and full of heart all at the same time prove that he's also an incredible one. "Slumdog" is just the beginning for Boyle who might be one of the most progressive and talented directors working today.\n\nIt's hard to be completely blown away by a film whose core message is about destiny and leans on the fact that Jamal is simply fated to do this well in explaining what has unfolded, but like any good film ought to, Boyle makes you a fan of the characters and not care as much about the logistics as you might normally do. The fact that this film starts out so dramatic and real makes it hard to embrace the fairytale it blossoms into, but it's the great visual storytelling along the way that makes it so enjoyable. \n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":819404,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-03-18","keywords":"papadum,murder,india,non professional cast,prostitute","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Slumdog Millionaire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2220163097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of how impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik became a contestant on the Hindi version of "Who Wants to be A Millionaire?" -- an endeavor made in  an effort to prove his love for his friend Latika, who is an ardent fan of the show.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2353862/","name":"Dev Patel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795661/","name":"Saurabh Shukla"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0849164/","name":"Loveleen Tandan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152921/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064479/","name":"Simon Beaufoy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3139511/","name":"Vikas Swarup"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While "Slumdog Millionaire" is far from a Bollywood tragic love story filled with singing and dancing, the way director Danny Boyle will rivet audiences with his film that is authentic to Indian culture while using a distinctly Western style of film-making might be enough proof that there is a profit to be made here.\n\n"Slumdog Millionaire" is a drama exposing the tragic effects of poverty in gigantic Indian cities like Mumbai that is also fused with a modern day Indian fairytale. Jamal Malik is a young man on India's "Who Wants to Be A Millionaire" and is a question away from one million dollars when he's arrested on suspicion of cheating. Because Jamal is from the slums of India and has no educational background, it seems entirely improbable if not impossible that Jamal could make it this far, but each question is connected with distinct and sometimes painful memories for Jamal. It's as if he is destined to win, even though he only went on the show to impress a girl he has loved his whole life, Latika.\n\nDanny Boyle ("28 Days Later," "Sunshine") takes us from memory to memory as Jamal advances question by question toward the million dollars. These memories offer vivid insight into poverty in India as well as the lives of Jamal, Latika and Jamal's older brother Salim. As children they are left parentless and taught how to swindle tourists, leading to lives of little fulfillment or even corruption. Despite being separated, Jamal and Latika are reunited several times and in fact Jamal's only motivation in life is his love for her.\n\nWhile the young, unknown, Indian actors are absolutely amazing in this film, the biggest kudos go to director Boyle, who creates an astonishing film. For Boyle to go from science fiction and zombie thrillers to taking on a project as daring and unusual as "Slumdog Millionaire" proves that he's not only a brave director, but a versatile one. His great success with making this film intense, eye-opening and full of heart all at the same time prove that he's also an incredible one. "Slumdog" is just the beginning for Boyle who might be one of the most progressive and talented directors working today.\n\nIt's hard to be completely blown away by a film whose core message is about destiny and leans on the fact that Jamal is simply fated to do this well in explaining what has unfolded, but like any good film ought to, Boyle makes you a fan of the characters and not care as much about the logistics as you might normally do. The fact that this film starts out so dramatic and real makes it hard to embrace the fairytale it blossoms into, but it's the great visual storytelling along the way that makes it so enjoyable. \n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":819404,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-03-18","keywords":"papadum,murder,india,non professional cast,prostitute","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Slumdog Millionaire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2220163097","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjQzNzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of how impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik became a contestant on the Hindi version of "Who Wants to be A Millionaire?" -- an endeavor made in  an effort to prove his love for his friend Latika, who is an ardent fan of the show."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2353862/","name":"Dev Patel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0795661/","name":"Saurabh Shukla"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0849164/","name":"Loveleen Tandan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152921/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064479/","name":"Simon Beaufoy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3139511/","name":"Vikas Swarup"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Instead, there is just a handful of characters, and they discuss about consequences. It's a discussion that won't happen in reality, of course, but the characters represent the different viewpoints in the drone killing process, and they do it very well. As another comment said: you have never seen a Skype call this gripping. This is great cinematography.\n\nHad it just been a discussion about the moral ambiguity of drone strikes, the movie would not have convinced. Where the movie shines, IMO, is its portrayal of uncertainty. Reality cannot be manipulated, and can certainly not be taken for granted. The outcome is not decided in the discussion, but afterwards, and we have to face it. That can make you reluctant to act to the point of cowardice, or all gung-ho, but it doesn't make a difference in the end.\n\nSo, is there a happy ending? It doesn't matter.

Instead, there is just a handful of characters, and they discuss about consequences. It's a discussion that won't happen in reality, of course, but the characters represent the different viewpoints in the drone killing process, and they do it very well. As another comment said: you have never seen a Skype call this gripping. This is great cinematography.\n\nHad it just been a discussion about the moral ambiguity of drone strikes, the movie would not have convinced. Where the movie shines, IMO, is its portrayal of uncertainty. Reality cannot be manipulated, and can certainly not be taken for granted. The outcome is not decided in the discussion, but afterwards, and we have to face it. That can make you reluctant to act to the point of cowardice, or all gung-ho, but it doesn't make a difference in the end.\n\nSo, is there a happy ending? It doesn't matter. Live with the pain.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82463,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-04-15","keywords":"drone pilot,terrorist cell,drone strike,terrorist,collateral damage","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1137947161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNzYzMjc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTM1MjA0NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNzYzMjc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTM1MjA0NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"UK-based military officer Colonel Katherine Powell is in command of a top secret drone operation to capture terrorists in Kenya.

The script follows exactly the method of an unfortunate accident causing turmoil and chaos in a seemingly healthy family and then things start becoming interesting, secrets deeply buried surface, old forgotten grudges start to poke and so on.\n\nEven though it's a directorial debut of Mehdi Barsaoui, The film is really well made, there are some scenes that you would only expect from masters of filmmaking. Without trying to spoil any parts of the story, my only issue was that the film puts finger on so many conflicts, whether political, cultural or religion related in a rather short runtime (96 minutes) and the inevitable is that many ascepts, some really important ones, are left out or just briefly mentioned. I think this is caused by the ambitious mentality of the director as he tried do to score as high as possible.

Yet still this is a good film from a new voice.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":811,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-03-11","keywords":"troubled family,father son relationship,mother son relationship,husband wife relationship,tunisian lebanese production","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi872529433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmJhZTVhZWQtZmMzNC00NGRjLWJjOTMtZjY3ZGJlZTlmYzU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmJhZTVhZWQtZmMzNC00NGRjLWJjOTMtZjY3ZGJlZTlmYzU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0098793/","name":"Sami Bouajila","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5858261/","name":"Najla Ben Abdallah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10923123/","name":"Youssef Khemiri"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5421179/","name":"Mehdi Barsaoui"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0039666/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0246993/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002052/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5421179/","name":"Mehdi Barsaoui"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.\n\nAt an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors - Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Henwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.\n\nWritten by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, and directed by William Eubank, Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Alien (1979) and The Abyss (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as Leviathan (1989), Event Horizon (1997), Sphere (1998), and Sunshine (2007). I even detected a slight nod to The Descent (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic "group of isolated people getting picked off one by one". When someone as talented as Danny Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.\n\nSure, it isn't really about much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled "too deep" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And Underwater is both.\n\nKicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. Alien takes its time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the Nostromo, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, Underwater is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.\n\nAesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.\n\nElsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, Abner Marín's creature design is suitably creepy and grotesque. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was Wayne Lemmer's sound design. The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.\n\nIn terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995). There's also next to no characterisation. We learn bits and pieces about Norah and Lucien's backstories, but apart from that, the film is peopled by perfunctory cardboard cut-outs with no sense of interiority. Eubank also seems somewhat confused as to whether he's making a disaster movie or a monster movie, with certain scenes and elements suggesting one or the other. However, he never really finds a middle-ground, giving the film a slightly schizophrenic tone.\n\nAlthough Underwater never manages to rise anywhere near the heights of films such as Alien and Sunshine, it deserved better treatment than it received from Fox and Disney. Given the January release, the clichéd setup, the two-year limbo, and the bland title, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-01-10","keywords":"sea monster,lovecraftian,ocean,group of survivors,monster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1414249497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A crew of underwater researchers must scramble to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6974206/","name":"Mamoudou Athie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827931/","name":"William Eubank"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3929259/","name":"Brian Duffield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092414/","name":"Adam Cozad"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.\n\nAt an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors - Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Henwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.\n\nWritten by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, and directed by William Eubank, Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Alien (1979) and The Abyss (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as Leviathan (1989), Event Horizon (1997), Sphere (1998), and Sunshine (2007). I even detected a slight nod to The Descent (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic "group of isolated people getting picked off one by one". When someone as talented as Danny Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.\n\nSure, it isn't really about much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled "too deep" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And Underwater is both.\n\nKicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. Alien takes its time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the Nostromo, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, Underwater is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.\n\nAesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.\n\nElsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, Abner Marín's creature design is suitably creepy and grotesque. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was Wayne Lemmer's sound design. The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.\n\nIn terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995). There's also next to no characterisation. We learn bits and pieces about Norah and Lucien's backstories, but apart from that, the film is peopled by perfunctory cardboard cut-outs with no sense of interiority. Eubank also seems somewhat confused as to whether he's making a disaster movie or a monster movie, with certain scenes and elements suggesting one or the other. However, he never really finds a middle-ground, giving the film a slightly schizophrenic tone.\n\nAlthough Underwater never manages to rise anywhere near the heights of films such as Alien and Sunshine, it deserved better treatment than it received from Fox and Disney. Given the January release, the clichéd setup, the two-year limbo, and the bland title, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-01-10","keywords":"sea monster,lovecraftian,ocean,group of survivors,monster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1414249497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A crew of underwater researchers must scramble to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6974206/","name":"Mamoudou Athie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827931/","name":"William Eubank"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3929259/","name":"Brian Duffield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092414/","name":"Adam Cozad"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.\n\nAt an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors - Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Henwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.\n\nWritten by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, and directed by William Eubank, Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Alien (1979) and The Abyss (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as Leviathan (1989), Event Horizon (1997), Sphere (1998), and Sunshine (2007). I even detected a slight nod to The Descent (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic "group of isolated people getting picked off one by one". When someone as talented as Danny Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.\n\nSure, it isn't really about much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled "too deep" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And Underwater is both.\n\nKicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. Alien takes its time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the Nostromo, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, Underwater is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.\n\nAesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.\n\nElsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, Abner Marín's creature design is suitably creepy and grotesque. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was Wayne Lemmer's sound design. The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.\n\nIn terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995). There's also next to no characterisation. We learn bits and pieces about Norah and Lucien's backstories, but apart from that, the film is peopled by perfunctory cardboard cut-outs with no sense of interiority. Eubank also seems somewhat confused as to whether he's making a disaster movie or a monster movie, with certain scenes and elements suggesting one or the other. However, he never really finds a middle-ground, giving the film a slightly schizophrenic tone.\n\nAlthough Underwater never manages to rise anywhere near the heights of films such as Alien and Sunshine, it deserved better treatment than it received from Fox and Disney. Given the January release, the clichéd setup, the two-year limbo, and the bland title, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-01-10","keywords":"sea monster,lovecraftian,ocean,group of survivors,monster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1414249497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A crew of underwater researchers must scramble to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6974206/","name":"Mamoudou Athie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827931/","name":"William Eubank"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3929259/","name":"Brian Duffield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092414/","name":"Adam Cozad"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A well performed, touching and interesting show caught my eye. The characters are involving, are worth caring about and have a strong sense of purpose. Each one brings something to the mix and adds their own skills to the events of each episode. Each episode has a strong mystery to be solved, sometimes offering an intriguing moral dilemma to both Murdoch and the viewer. It is also very reassuring to not have modern day morality thrust into the past as happens so frequently with other shows (yes 'Dr Quinn Medicine Woman', I mean you), dealing with the nineteenth century. Instead we are allowed to explore the world as they see it, enjoying the discoveries and trying to find a way forward into a new century. Well done to all concerned and long may it continue.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12047,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Perhaps a little formulaic and not particularly creative in its plot devices, but altogether an enjoyable way to while away an hour on a Friday night. In fact, I may now read the novels after all.\n\nHowever, as I haven't read them I can't really comment on the criticisms of other reviewers that the storyline was changed and that the main character suffered in her translation from print to screen. Obviously it's often difficult to leave a story unchanged because it just doesn't work in film the way it does in a book; and who knows what other (budgetary) restrictions the production was working within.\n\nThe sometimes ponderous camera work and precise, deliberate acting reminded me pleasantly of the Poirot series- although Phryne Fisher is rather racier than the little Belgian. I enjoyed the recreation of late-20s Melbourne, including the bright, interesting wardrobe of the leading lady. I got a little annoyed in some of the middle episodes that the storyline concerning Phryne's sister appeared to be dropped as it was the most intriguing thing about the early episodes, but I was satisfied by the end of the series. I also liked the development of the friendship between Phryne and Jack Robinson, and Hugh &amp; Dot were quite cute too.\n\nDon't sit down to this expecting something mind-altering or deeply intellectual. This is quality b-grade and proud of it; it does its thing very well indeed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14820,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-02-24","keywords":"liberated woman,australia,female protagonist,headstrong woman,detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204583/","name":"Essie Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656289/","name":"Nathan Page","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3793639/","name":"Hugo Johnstone-Burt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346452/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3789075225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Hardly believable, and only suitable for a kid's series. It's a shame, the period locations, sets and costumes were enjoyable, and the supporting cast was OK.

A well performed, touching and interesting show caught my eye. The characters are involving, are worth caring about and have a strong sense of purpose. Each one brings something to the mix and adds their own skills to the events of each episode. Each episode has a strong mystery to be solved, sometimes offering an intriguing moral dilemma to both Murdoch and the viewer. It is also very reassuring to not have modern day morality thrust into the past as happens so frequently with other shows (yes 'Dr Quinn Medicine Woman', I mean you), dealing with the nineteenth century. Instead we are allowed to explore the world as they see it, enjoying the discoveries and trying to find a way forward into a new century. Well done to all concerned and long may it continue.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12047,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Agatha is suffering writer's block and her husband is seeking a divorce; then she is approached to solve a real murder. Initially unenthusiastic she later agrees and starts investigating. Pretending to be a lawyer named Mary Westmacott she assembles the suspects, with the lure of a large inheritance and starts questioning them. She quickly realises that real mysteries and works of fiction are quite different.\n\nI confess I was a little unsure about the premise of putting a real person in an obviously fictional situation... but surprisingly it really works if you can suspend your disbelief somewhat. The story nicely combines known facts about her life at the time with an interesting fiction. The mystery she investigates has the feel of one of her stories, perhaps somewhat helped by the way the time period is captured. There are a good number of suspects, each with their own motives, as well as one or two red herrings.

Agatha is suffering writer's block and her husband is seeking a divorce; then she is approached to solve a real murder. Initially unenthusiastic she later agrees and starts investigating. Pretending to be a lawyer named Mary Westmacott she assembles the suspects, with the lure of a large inheritance and starts questioning them. She quickly realises that real mysteries and works of fiction are quite different.\n\nI confess I was a little unsure about the premise of putting a real person in an obviously fictional situation... but surprisingly it really works if you can suspend your disbelief somewhat. The story nicely combines known facts about her life at the time with an interesting fiction. The mystery she investigates has the feel of one of her stories, perhaps somewhat helped by the way the time period is captured. There are a good number of suspects, each with their own motives, as well as one or two red herrings. The cast are really good; most notably Ruth Bradley as Agatha Christie, Pippa Haywood, as the woman who brought the mystery to her and Tim McInnerny as one of the suspects. As stated before it is necessary to suspends one's disbelief at times; noticeably towards the end when a local policeman recognises our protagonist but does tell the authorities despite it being made clear that there is a nationwide manhunt for her.

As you probably know the Manhattan Project was a research and development project for the first Atomic Bomb, thus the name of the show Manh(A)ttan with the middle A stylized as separated.\n\nThe series follows the lives of the families living in a strict, military controlled, village in the middle of the desert. In that place paranoia rules. Because of the big secret (the development of the "gadget" as they call it) everyone is considered a possible leak or a suspect for espionage. Their correspondence to the outside world is controlled, the army makes random checks to them and their belongings, they even have to take polygraph tests if they seem more suspicious than others.\n\nThe production has nothing to envy from a feature film. Attention to detail. Countless extras and above all a remarkable cinematography. The way they make you feel the "space", the atmosphere of this place is extraordinary. \n\nI hope it will continue in the same fashion and not consume itself in many subplots and little dramas that will make it tiresome. (If it does, it wouldn't be the first time a great pilot is followed by mediocre episodes). But for now...\n\n***Highly recommended.\n\nUPDATE after having seen 9 episodes\n\nUnfortunately my fears have been realized. The show is full of pointless subplots and is now boring and far from entertaining.\n\nOppenheimer's screen time is measured in ...seconds in the 10 hours I wasted to watch this.\n\nThe race for the atomic bomb and WW2 is almost absent.\n\nIt's all about the lives and the little dramas of the wives, the mistresses and the ..$2 prostitutes who live in the camp. Who gets high with what, who is screwing whom etc.\n\nMaybe they should change the title to MANHATTAN HOUSEWIVES.\n\n***Overall: Avoid it. I'm changing my rating from 8 to a (very generous) 4.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8180,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2014-07-27","keywords":"1940s,year 1944,year 1943,manhattan project,los alamos new mexico","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3014031/","name":"Rachel Brosnahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985974/","name":"Michael Chernus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706832/","name":"Christopher Denham"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126698/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0562101/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2212280/","name":"Sam Shaw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1935127321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A well performed, touching and interesting show caught my eye. The characters are involving, are worth caring about and have a strong sense of purpose. Each one brings something to the mix and adds their own skills to the events of each episode. Each episode has a strong mystery to be solved, sometimes offering an intriguing moral dilemma to both Murdoch and the viewer. It is also very reassuring to not have modern day morality thrust into the past as happens so frequently with other shows (yes 'Dr Quinn Medicine Woman', I mean you), dealing with the nineteenth century. Instead we are allowed to explore the world as they see it, enjoying the discoveries and trying to find a way forward into a new century.

It maintains everything that makes Inspector Morse so good, while also containing enough to make it its own.\n\nEndeavour looks great, the series throughout is exquisitely photographed and there is something very nostalgic and charming about the atmospherically evoked 1960s period detail. It was also a genius move to keep Barrington Pheloung on board, with his hauntingly beautiful scoring and immortal Inspector Morse theme, while the classical music and operatic excerpts are delightful to hear and fit perfectly (a notable example would be in the Fugue episode, the music having a beautiful and frightfully ominous effect).\n\nThe series is also every bit as intelligently written as Inspector Morse, it's every bit as entertaining and also every bit as tense. Not all the story lines are very original, but they are always incredibly gripping with the mysteries not being too complicated or the identities being too improbable or obvious, Morse and Thursday's father/son relationship has a lot of warmth, is so well written within the stories and is a large part of the series' appeal and there is some good suspense (chilling in fact in the case of Fugue). Pacing is restrained, but that allows the atmosphere to come through, and pretty much all the same it excels in that aspect. The characters are interesting, and are evolving more and more with every episode, Morse's familiar characteristics are becoming more obvious as the writing develops and Morse and Thursday's relationship more entertaining and heartfelt.\n\nShaun Evans does some powerful, charismatic work as younger Morse, and is getting more and more confident with every episode, showing enough loyalty to John Thaw's iconic Morse while making the character his own too. Roger Allam is also superb, his rapport with Evans always compels and entertains but Thursday is quite a sympathetic character, as well as loyal and firm, and Allam does a lot special with a role that could have been less interesting possibly in lesser hands. All the acting is very good, as is the controlled direction, but it's the performances of Evans and Allam that will always be remembered most vividly.\n\nAll in all, a more than worthy (if not quite as good, only because I love Inspector Morse with a passion) prequel series and also a great series on its own that keeps getting stronger. 9/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21862,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It maintains everything that makes Inspector Morse so good, while also containing enough to make it its own.\n\nEndeavour looks great, the series throughout is exquisitely photographed and there is something very nostalgic and charming about the atmospherically evoked 1960s period detail. It was also a genius move to keep Barrington Pheloung on board, with his hauntingly beautiful scoring and immortal Inspector Morse theme, while the classical music and operatic excerpts are delightful to hear and fit perfectly (a notable example would be in the Fugue episode, the music having a beautiful and frightfully ominous effect).\n\nThe series is also every bit as intelligently written as Inspector Morse, it's every bit as entertaining and also every bit as tense. Not all the story lines are very original, but they are always incredibly gripping with the mysteries not being too complicated or the identities being too improbable or obvious, Morse and Thursday's father/son relationship has a lot of warmth, is so well written within the stories and is a large part of the series' appeal and there is some good suspense (chilling in fact in the case of Fugue). Pacing is restrained, but that allows the atmosphere to come through, and pretty much all the same it excels in that aspect. The characters are interesting, and are evolving more and more with every episode, Morse's familiar characteristics are becoming more obvious as the writing develops and Morse and Thursday's relationship more entertaining and heartfelt.\n\nShaun Evans does some powerful, charismatic work as younger Morse, and is getting more and more confident with every episode, showing enough loyalty to John Thaw's iconic Morse while making the character his own too. Roger Allam is also superb, his rapport with Evans always compels and entertains but Thursday is quite a sympathetic character, as well as loyal and firm, and Allam does a lot special with a role that could have been less interesting possibly in lesser hands. All the acting is very good, as is the controlled direction, but it's the performances of Evans and Allam that will always be remembered most vividly.\n\nAll in all, a more than worthy (if not quite as good, only because I love Inspector Morse with a passion) prequel series and also a great series on its own that keeps getting stronger. 9/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21862,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The word, "noble" means something and not all noblemen demonstrate it. The relationships are not predictable, nor the storyline which shows the desperation of those who scrape by--mostly with honor--and some not troubled by honor but wealth. From our first introduction to Ross, he shows his character and it is impossible not to care about him the way he cares about those in his life.

Now, we get to see inside the daily lives of a family whose job is to solve crimes, instead of committing them, and thanks to an ensemble of gifted actors, it's quite interesting to see their interactions, both personally and professionally.\n\nFrank Reagan is the chief of police in New York City, a man deeply respected by his family and the people he works with. His oldest son Danny (Donnie Wahlberg) is a homicide detective with a reputation for not doing things by the book, and in the first episode already he sticks someones head in a toilet to get the location of a missing girl out of him. While people admire as someone who gets the job done, he has alienated several people over the years through his views and methods, including his sister Erin (Bridget Moynahan). She is a district attorney, and since Danny often uses unorthodox and even illegal methods to arrest criminals, she has a hard time with convicting them, causing them to argue quite frequently. Jamie (Will Estes) is their youngest brother, and after finishing law school, suddenly decides to become a police officer, much to the dismay of his fiancé. Although still a rookie, he is approached by a secret society called the Blue Templars, who wish to hire him to investigate the death of his brother, who was a cop himself and was shot while investigating a case.\n\nThe show comes up with an interesting concept,showing us the interaction of these four family members while investigating crimes and how they often clash in their believes and principles. Donnie Wahlberg's character Danny is probably the most interesting one of the bunch, mainly because it's hinted at that he was in Iraq, and that his tendency to loose patience with the people he arrests is rooted in something he experienced there. It's good to have Tom Selleck back on TV, who is a better actor now than ever, and since I already liked him in the Jesse Stones movies, it's great that I get to see him every week now.\n\nYou can watch Blue Bloods every Friday at 10 on CBS, and since it's one of the most successful shows that have ever aired in the time slot, it looks like it stands a very high chance of surviving for more than a season, which will be an achievement not shared by too many of the new shows, I'm sure.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35356,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-09-24","keywords":"new york police department,family relationships,brother brother relationship,father daughter relationship,family of cops","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005531/","name":"Donnie Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005256/","name":"Bridget Moynahan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0261678/","name":"Will Estes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106949/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315236/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121331/","name":"Mitchell Burgess"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1053841/","name":"Robin Green"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blue Bloods: Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4119967769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"First Look Trailer for Blue Bloods"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now, we get to see inside the daily lives of a family whose job is to solve crimes, instead of committing them, and thanks to an ensemble of gifted actors, it's quite interesting to see their interactions, both personally and professionally.\n\nFrank Reagan is the chief of police in New York City, a man deeply respected by his family and the people he works with. His oldest son Danny (Donnie Wahlberg) is a homicide detective with a reputation for not doing things by the book, and in the first episode already he sticks someones head in a toilet to get the location of a missing girl out of him. While people admire as someone who gets the job done, he has alienated several people over the years through his views and methods, including his sister Erin (Bridget Moynahan). She is a district attorney, and since Danny often uses unorthodox and even illegal methods to arrest criminals, she has a hard time with convicting them, causing them to argue quite frequently. Jamie (Will Estes) is their youngest brother, and after finishing law school, suddenly decides to become a police officer, much to the dismay of his fiancé. Although still a rookie, he is approached by a secret society called the Blue Templars, who wish to hire him to investigate the death of his brother, who was a cop himself and was shot while investigating a case.\n\nThe show comes up with an interesting concept,showing us the interaction of these four family members while investigating crimes and how they often clash in their believes and principles. Donnie Wahlberg's character Danny is probably the most interesting one of the bunch, mainly because it's hinted at that he was in Iraq, and that his tendency to loose patience with the people he arrests is rooted in something he experienced there.

Please don't cancel the show, it's my favorite show on TV.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7426,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2015-09-23","keywords":"laboratory,pathologist,miami florida,lesbian couple,private practice","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004820/","name":"Morris Chestnut","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1632786/","name":"Jaina Lee Ortiz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827488/","name":"Gabrielle Dennis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069651/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0555624/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1029960/","name":"Todd Harthan"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3235099417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2MDc5ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1NzQ1NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2MDc5ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1NzQ1NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official trailer for Rosewood on Fox."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The overall content and dynamic are exceptional. Dr.Rosewood(M.Chestnut)would be an even better character if there are more episodes that would involve more background for other characters(Mitchie,Annalise,Etc.)would be great as well. The main thing that keeps dropping the ratings are the time slots. If you change them there will be a lot better ratings, as when it was paired with Empire.

I saw the first episode and was impressed but like with a lot of TV series I found good such as the X-files I just forgot about it and never watched it, anyway about 2 months ago I heard and advert on the radio for it and so watched it. I have been watching it religously since, I have missed most of series one and the first few episodes of series two which annoys me but every episode is great, well written and excellently acted and directed. What sets this out from other TV shows is the incredibly professional look, from the movie like cinematography to the brilliant acting, the writing is always very good and the plot twists always surprising whilst feasible. I wish I had watched it since series one. I am a fan of Marg Helgenberger, I find her very sexy, she is a gorgeous woman and this really made me finally decide to watch it, as I usually watch something from the movie channels on saturdays. The show has a great production value and its got that Bruckheimer class about it. They always have good directors such as Danny Cannon who also did the underrated Stallone flick Judge Dredd. All the actors are good the two younger guys played by Gary Dourdon and George Eads and the nice looking Joja Fox and they and Marg are all led by the ultra intelligent Gill Grissom, excellently played by the one of the shows producers William Peterson, the lines Grissom has are classic. The show has some generally interesting characters who are all likeable. This show is pure TV excellence and it gets a bonus thumbs up because they cast one of my fave actors Mark Dacascos in an episode which should reach the UK in about 7 weeks. 10/10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80131,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2000-10-06","keywords":"crime scene investigation,las vegas nevada,crime lab,police,detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000401/","name":"Laurence Fishburne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001339/","name":"Marg Helgenberger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0247040/","name":"George Eads"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

Ova serija vodi nas u australsku provinciju pedesetih godina prošlog stoljeća, gdje se doktor-forenzičar Lucien Blake protivi strogim društvenim pravilima. Dok rješava zločine, dr. Blake sluša tajne i laži svojih pacijenata i pomaže im da unesu mir i pravdu u svoje živote. Blake je obrazovan, proputovao je svijet i vidio najgore što ljudi mogu učiniti jedni drugima. Nakon studija u Škotskoj, dr. Blake je kao vojni ljekar u britanskoj vojsci služio na Dalekom istoku tokom Drugoga svjetskog rata. Bez znanja porodice oženio se Kineskinjom s kojom je dobio dijete. U doba pada Singapura izgubili su kontakt. Na kraju duge i neuspješne potrage za suprugom i djetetom, dr. Blake se vraća u rodni Ballarat, kako bi preuzeo praksu od svog oca na samrti. Progone ga uspomene na ratne užase, zatočeništvo u zloglasnom logoru u Tajlandu i njegov lični gubitak. U javnosti dr. Blake je moralni kompas zajednice, dok je privatno čovjek koji iz prve ruke zna kako ljudi mogu biti nečovječni prema drugima. Rijetki razumiju njegov vragolasti humor i mogu probiti njegov psihološki oklop. Čak ni njegova odana asistentica Jean ponekad nema strpljenja za Dr. Blakea.</desc>

One of if not the greatest films ever! My favorite film of all time! "Ghostbusters" is the film that made me become a fan ever since I was young! It had an awesome cast, cool special effects, hilarious dialogue and a kick-ass soundtrack! The film that can be watched over and over again! I grew up watching Ghostbusters on TV and the animated TV series The Real Ghostbusters (1986 - 1991). Ghostbusters II (1989) actually introduced me in to Ghostbusters. I loved them so much that I even said to my mom, when I grown up I will be a Ghostbuster! It was my fantasy. Watching it yesterday and I still love it. I love this flick to death! I still can't believe it how the world changed and how in the 80's the world was better than today! I always have enjoyed the sequel much better than as a child, it was my first movie but now as an adult, I love and enjoy the original movie to death! It is the only movie I own on Blu-ray disc and I still love it. \n\nThis is an amazing movie! Funny, smart, well written and directed. It features an outstanding performance from Bill Murray, great showings by Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and one of the last documented instances of Dan Aykroyd being funny on film (he was blown by a ghost!). In fact, the film gets a great performances from nearly everyone who appears in it- from Annie Potts, to the guy who played Lenny the Mayor, to the handsome cab driver who calls Rick Moranis an asshole. In addition, they had one of the best "a-hole" guys ever to appear on film, as the film's bad guy- I'm talking of course of the grossly under-rated William Atherton- who played the EPA guy, "Dickless". Atherton, of course went on to play memorable a-holes in Real Genius and of course he was the annoying reporter in Die Hard (1988) but here in Ghostbusters, you really see a solid performance by maybe the best guy to play an a-hole in films in the 80's. \n\nNext Year the reboot is coming out as Paul Feig's Ghostsnuters, Ghostbitches or Ghostflufers./: Ghostbusters (2016) with women now as a Ghostbusters! Why rebooting this awesome supernatural spectacular comedy flick? I know the sequel failed and Bill Murray did not want anything to do with it. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't have made Ghostbusters III in the 90's, they should have! Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis tried so hard to convince Bill Murray to do it for the third sequel and they couldn't convinced him. They are going to ruin the Original movie! I don't want to see Ghostbusters with a female leads. Come on? The girls are not the Ghostbusters, they are three man a scientists and a one civilian. The Ghostbusters are the only one Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Bill Murray. They were always be the Ghostbusters that will be the case. No one else will be! No one else will replace them! This is like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) that come out the same year as the Ghostbusters did, they remake it and that remake failed!! It was awful boring! Why remaking or rebooting my classic horror comedy's that I Love?! Ghostbusters (1984) are unique, classic 80's masterpiece! These were the best times for movies ever!!! One of my favorite soundtracks and movie of all time!\n\nThey just don't make them like this anymore. This is comedic writing and performance at its peak... with quotes that everyone knows and enjoys. From "This reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head" to "Symmetrical book stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947" to "Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you! " this is a CLASSIC movie! Ghostbusters is a true classic comedy that stands the test of time. The film is funny, awesome and entertaining. It has a lot of laughs. I love the soundtrack Ghostbusters Written and Performed by Ray Parker Jr. I think he did made a great soundtrack in the 80's. If there's something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!!!! A film that can be watched with the various youngest to the very oldest of the family. Wonderful collection of characters. A film that is treasured by just about everyone that watches it. I miss movies from the 80's and this film felt so realistic. Sigourney Weaver was just so outstanding as Dana Barrett after she made the horror flick Alien (1979 and Aliens (1986). \n\nGhostbusters is a 1984 American supernatural comedy film, directed and produced by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. The film stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. \n\n10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Columbia Pictures, Black Rhino Delphi Productions Starring: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, William Atherton, Ernie Hudson Director: Ivan Reitman Producer: Ivan Reitman Screenplay: Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis Rated: PG Running Time: 1 Hrs. 45 Mins.

The Ghostbusters are the only one Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Bill Murray. They were always be the Ghostbusters that will be the case. No one else will be! No one else will replace them! This is like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) that come out the same year as the Ghostbusters did, they remake it and that remake failed!! It was awful boring! Why remaking or rebooting my classic horror comedy's that I Love?! Ghostbusters (1984) are unique, classic 80's masterpiece! These were the best times for movies ever!!! One of my favorite soundtracks and movie of all time!\n\nThey just don't make them like this anymore. This is comedic writing and performance at its peak... with quotes that everyone knows and enjoys. From "This reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head" to "Symmetrical book stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947" to "Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you! " this is a CLASSIC movie! Ghostbusters is a true classic comedy that stands the test of time. The film is funny, awesome and entertaining. It has a lot of laughs. I love the soundtrack Ghostbusters Written and Performed by Ray Parker Jr. I think he did made a great soundtrack in the 80's. If there's something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!!!! A film that can be watched with the various youngest to the very oldest of the family. Wonderful collection of characters. A film that is treasured by just about everyone that watches it. I miss movies from the 80's and this film felt so realistic. Sigourney Weaver was just so outstanding as Dana Barrett after she made the horror flick Alien (1979 and Aliens (1986). \n\nGhostbusters is a 1984 American supernatural comedy film, directed and produced by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. The film stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. \n\n10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Columbia Pictures, Black Rhino Delphi Productions Starring: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, William Atherton, Ernie Hudson Director: Ivan Reitman Producer: Ivan Reitman Screenplay: Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis Rated: PG Running Time: 1 Hrs. 45 Mins.

My thought is, if you don't like it, don't watch it. I personally enjoy it, along with the Chicago franchise (Fire&amp;PD). The crossover events are especially fun to watch. Is the use of accurate information on medication always correct? I can't say as I am not a doctor. I watch it because I like the characters and the stories. I'm sure there could be improvements, as with most tv. But this is not a documentary, its meant for entertainment. At least the characters have back stories. Lives outside the hospital. Dick Wolf has smartly created a network of series that all intermingle and its interesting to see how the New York shows come into play with the Chicago shows. So, just try it. And I don't mean to offend but to say it's like a soap opera is kinda funny to me because what is Grey's if not a soap? Most medical dramas have an element of such as well as miraculous cures at the end of the hour.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20278,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-11-17","keywords":"shared universe,doctor,emergency room,hospital,medical profession","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3674742/","name":"Nick Gehlfuss"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0012679/","name":"Marlyne Barrett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0580924/","name":"S.

My thought is, if you don't like it, don't watch it. I personally enjoy it, along with the Chicago franchise (Fire&amp;PD). The crossover events are especially fun to watch. Is the use of accurate information on medication always correct? I can't say as I am not a doctor. I watch it because I like the characters and the stories. I'm sure there could be improvements, as with most tv. But this is not a documentary, its meant for entertainment. At least the characters have back stories. Lives outside the hospital. Dick Wolf has smartly created a network of series that all intermingle and its interesting to see how the New York shows come into play with the Chicago shows. So, just try it. And I don't mean to offend but to say it's like a soap opera is kinda funny to me because what is Grey's if not a soap? Most medical dramas have an element of such as well as miraculous cures at the end of the hour.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20278,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-11-17","keywords":"shared universe,doctor,emergency room,hospital,medical profession","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3674742/","name":"Nick Gehlfuss","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0012679/","name":"Marlyne Barrett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0580924/","name":"S.

Since not every show that's a hit in America exports well to the UK ("Friends" gathered plenty of them over here, and "CSI: Insert Subtitle Here" has consistently been a key player for what used to be called Channel 5; on the other hand, "Murphy Brown" landed on stony soil when it was shown on BBC2, and don't get UK fans started on how "The West Wing" fares here), that's a good question. Fortunately, there is an answer. In fact, several...\n\n1. Germaine Greer, Janet Street-Porter, the editor of "Cosmopolitan" (UK edition) and the TV critics of "The Times" and "The Mirror" have all pooh-poohed it. Since I respect their opinions in the same way I admire Britney Spears purely for her music, this is pretty much a glowing recommendation.\n\n2. Never discount prior experience; just as many critics noted David Chase's work on "The Rockford Files" when "The Sopranos" started here (and never once gave due credit for that beloved '70s show to Stephen J. Cannell and the late Roy Huggins, but that's another story), so creator Marc Cherry's years on "The Golden Girls" (another show that did well here) may have counted. And though I admit I've never liked her, the goodwill Teri Hatcher built up among viewers of both sexes from playing Lois Lane for four years cannot be overlooked.\n\n3. It strikes a major blow on behalf of those of us who don't give a rodent's rump about reality TV.\n\n4. It fills the "Melrose Place"/"Knots Landing"/primetime soap-sized hole that's been gaping for a while now, even down to having former cast members of same, and does it without wildly OTT acting (making it closer to "Knots Landing" in terms of temperament).\n\n5. The series wisely makes at least one of its main characters (Felicity Huffman's Lynette) seem like someone you could actually imagine meeting (key rule of TV: never make everyone too implausible OR too plausible - if everyone really wanted reality no one would have a TV. Or fiction books...).\n\n6. It's both emotional and funny; and it may take a while to wrap up its plot lines, but if the alternative is a whole load of wad-shooting, I'll be patient.\n\n7. The acting. Hatcher may have top-billing and a Golden Globe (and don't bet against her adding an Emmy in September), but five minutes watching Marcia Cross or the aforementioned Miss Huffman will tell you who the real stars are, acting-wise (the ex-Kimberly should have won the GG, not the ex-Mrs. Superman).\n\n8. The eye-candy; never mind "Which desperate housewife are you?" think "Which desperate housewife do you want to sleep with?" Teri still has plenty of devotees and Nicollette Sheridan remains as hot as she was on "Knots Landing" (even if it's not real, it's spectacular) but it's Eva Longoria who really regularly leads viewers into temptation.

I just wish they would let it be it's own thing instead of shoving characters from The Fosters down our throats every chance they get.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5583,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-01-08","keywords":"live","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2314596/","name":"Maia Mitchell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2028116/","name":"Cierra Ramirez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5264136/","name":"Zuri Adele"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0287645/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021149/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1401678/","name":"Bradley Bredeweg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425394/","name":"Joanna Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656739/","name":"Peter Paige"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 1 Promo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi153598489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzN2MzYjAtMWIxNy00MjViLWIzZmItNzMyOWUwZWM3NjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzN2MzYjAtMWIxNy00MjViLWIzZmItNzMyOWUwZWM3NjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Callie and Mariana Foster move to Los Angeles and begin their lives as young adults.

Since not every show that's a hit in America exports well to the UK ("Friends" gathered plenty of them over here, and "CSI: Insert Subtitle Here" has consistently been a key player for what used to be called Channel 5; on the other hand, "Murphy Brown" landed on stony soil when it was shown on BBC2, and don't get UK fans started on how "The West Wing" fares here), that's a good question. Fortunately, there is an answer. In fact, several...\n\n1. Germaine Greer, Janet Street-Porter, the editor of "Cosmopolitan" (UK edition) and the TV critics of "The Times" and "The Mirror" have all pooh-poohed it. Since I respect their opinions in the same way I admire Britney Spears purely for her music, this is pretty much a glowing recommendation.\n\n2. Never discount prior experience; just as many critics noted David Chase's work on "The Rockford Files" when "The Sopranos" started here (and never once gave due credit for that beloved '70s show to Stephen J. Cannell and the late Roy Huggins, but that's another story), so creator Marc Cherry's years on "The Golden Girls" (another show that did well here) may have counted. And though I admit I've never liked her, the goodwill Teri Hatcher built up among viewers of both sexes from playing Lois Lane for four years cannot be overlooked.\n\n3. It strikes a major blow on behalf of those of us who don't give a rodent's rump about reality TV.\n\n4. It fills the "Melrose Place"/"Knots Landing"/primetime soap-sized hole that's been gaping for a while now, even down to having former cast members of same, and does it without wildly OTT acting (making it closer to "Knots Landing" in terms of temperament).\n\n5. The series wisely makes at least one of its main characters (Felicity Huffman's Lynette) seem like someone you could actually imagine meeting (key rule of TV: never make everyone too implausible OR too plausible - if everyone really wanted reality no one would have a TV. Or fiction books...).\n\n6. It's both emotional and funny; and it may take a while to wrap up its plot lines, but if the alternative is a whole load of wad-shooting, I'll be patient.\n\n7. The acting. Hatcher may have top-billing and a Golden Globe (and don't bet against her adding an Emmy in September), but five minutes watching Marcia Cross or the aforementioned Miss Huffman will tell you who the real stars are, acting-wise (the ex-Kimberly should have won the GG, not the ex-Mrs. Superman).\n\n8. The eye-candy; never mind "Which desperate housewife are you?" think "Which desperate housewife do you want to sleep with?" Teri still has plenty of devotees and Nicollette Sheridan remains as hot as she was on "Knots Landing" (even if it's not real, it's spectacular) but it's Eva Longoria who really regularly leads viewers into temptation. And please do not deliver us from Eva. (I'll move on before making a "rod and staff" joke.) \n\n9. They had the good sense to get Danny Elfman to do the theme, and unlike "Point Pleasant," I can understand why he said yes.\n\nWelcome to Wisteria Lane. A great place to visit, thus far."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121727,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-10-03","keywords":"conflict of interest,female protagonist,friend,neighborhood,suicide","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000159/","name":"Teri Hatcher"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005031/","name":"Felicity Huffman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0189220/","name":"Marcia Cross"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028589/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0156100/","name":"Marc Cherry"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1644955417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"TT #1"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A year after successful middle-aged lawyer (Harris) divorces wife (Sarandon) we find him sharing his two school age kids and living with much younger beauty (Roberts).  The tension is palpable; between husband and ex-wife, between kids and girlfriend, and especially between ex-wife and girlfriend.  I thought this was going to be great, just bring it on home.\n\nThen the wings fall off, and the movie craters into the ground.  It's almost as if the writers and director were given the first half-hour of the movie, and told "now go finish the movie, but make it unwatchable".  Because that is what happens; the remaining hour of the movie is a painful flogging.\n\nThe plot and dialogue are unpredictable only in their unbelievability.  Does this stuff really happen?  Do divorced, unemployed single mothers live in mansions, drive high-end automobiles, and own horses?  Do writers and directors feel the need to string out multiple confessional scenes so they take up the last third of the movie?  Is this supposed to be entertaining? Enlightening?  What is going on here?  No, better yet, get me out of here!\n\nPity the poor actors, they give it their best, but this movie is a depressing loser."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64123,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1999-04-14","keywords":"cancer,custody,rapunzel character,singing along,singing girl","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stepmom","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1888157977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTVmM2I2M2ItMTliOS00ZDI0LTg0ZTMtZWY2YzQyOTU4YzQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTVmM2I2M2ItMTliOS00ZDI0LTg0ZTMtZWY2YzQyOTU4YzQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Tristar"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000215/","name":"Susan Sarandon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505144/","name":"Gigi Levangie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0625458/","name":"Jessie Nelson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0737216/","name":"Steven Rogers"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A year after successful middle-aged lawyer (Harris) divorces wife (Sarandon) we find him sharing his two school age kids and living with much younger beauty (Roberts).  The tension is palpable; between husband and ex-wife, between kids and girlfriend, and especially between ex-wife and girlfriend.  I thought this was going to be great, just bring it on home.\n\nThen the wings fall off, and the movie craters into the ground.  It's almost as if the writers and director were given the first half-hour of the movie, and told "now go finish the movie, but make it unwatchable".  Because that is what happens; the remaining hour of the movie is a painful flogging.\n\nThe plot and dialogue are unpredictable only in their unbelievability.  Does this stuff really happen?  Do divorced, unemployed single mothers live in mansions, drive high-end automobiles, and own horses?  Do writers and directors feel the need to string out multiple confessional scenes so they take up the last third of the movie?  Is this supposed to be entertaining? Enlightening?  What is going on here?  No, better yet, get me out of here!\n\nPity the poor actors, they give it their best, but this movie is a depressing loser.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64123,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1999-04-14","keywords":"cancer,custody,rapunzel character,singing along,singing girl","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stepmom","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1888157977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTVmM2I2M2ItMTliOS00ZDI0LTg0ZTMtZWY2YzQyOTU4YzQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTVmM2I2M2ItMTliOS00ZDI0LTg0ZTMtZWY2YzQyOTU4YzQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Tristar","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000215/","name":"Susan Sarandon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505144/","name":"Gigi Levangie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0625458/","name":"Jessie Nelson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0737216/","name":"Steven Rogers"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The Plot line is predictable, but it is the concepts that the director explores along the way that make it interesting an thought-provoking, assuming you pay attention and didn't just rent it for the bang-bang, or a chance to see Demi in a wet T-shirt. Ridley make some mistakes, but he does some really good things too. Let me comment on what some other people have said, and talk about what I think Ridley does well with this film.\n\nI think Mr. Scott gets a really excellent performance from Demi. I feel this is her best film, but I haven't seen to many, because she usually gets on my nerves. However, she is believable in the role of a woman who just wants to prove to herself that she can do this. I believe her when she says she doesn't want to be a poster child for women's rights... and the Commander is right in telling her that she's gonna have to wear that hat anyway.\n\nViggo is great too. I don't think too many people knew who he was when this movie came out, but he was even billed above Anne Bancroft. Someone said he looks embarrassed in every scene... hogwash. He looks like a very tough character in a very difficult situation. He knows that the issue is not whether a woman can make it, many can. This isn't about women's rights... this is about how men, mainly YOUNG men, relate to women in stressful situations. If all soldiers were in their late thirties, emotionally and psychologically, then the issue would be much smaller. Most of these guys are young, dumb and full of... you know the rhyme. I was there too, once upon a time. Viggo is excellent, he reacts the way many military instructors would... trying to stop the inevitable, fighting against politicians way over his head who have never been in the crap, but think they know better. Pay attention, you can just see that he respects LT O'Neil. But he believes he has to make an example out of her. Ms. Bancroft is excellent as well, some people say over the top, they obviously haven't had to deal with high level politics before. Perhaps she is a bit rough for reality, but remember, it is a movie, making a point, and being entertaining, things have to be gritty... and Senate will always be more vicious than any military training. I find her performance fun and a joy to watch.\n\nI don't know if Mr. Scott has any military training, but he does a better job of conveying the realities of it to the screen than most. Yes, the SERE segment goes farther than real SERE training would go... but not by much. Talk to someone who's been through it. It would not have been the same group of instructors... it's a very specialized field and the instructors have extensive psychological screening and training. However, I'll give that one to Ridley, he's trying not to complicate the plot, and he needs the scene with Master Chief Urgayle. BTW Women do go through SERE sometimes... and the instructors do use them against the men's emotions.\n\nAs for other Militray stuff, much of the language, feelings about chain of command, frustration with training constraints and political a**-covering was /On The Spot/. I speak from 6 years of experience as an Army officer (some of the stuff you see on active duty is amazing, but in the end it all balances out and the US Armed Forces are still the best in the world). Even the way Ridley has to frig with the plot to put the trainees in a an actual firefight was plausible... not possible, but plausible. Remember, it is a movie, he's got to have a real combat situation to entertain the dumber audience who just came to see the boom. But Ridley even goes far enough to give the Master Chief a chance to back out. It is a group of Navy SEAL trainees, deep into their training cycle, with a buttload of prior experience (IF you pay attention you will note that one of the trainees is a US Army Ranger, one a Marine, probably from RECON, these are guys who know the job already, and this is true to reality). You are also talking about a straight forward mission facilitating extraction of US Army Rangers from the deep inland mission. Ridley even has that right, this would be a Ranger mission, and the Spec-ops community may do a joint op where the SEALS secure the sea-side extraction point.\n\nQuite frankly... the movie is better than most people could have done. Matter of fact, I think it was a tough challenge for Mr. Scott and don't think anyone could have done much better. One bad point I agree with is that artistically, the movie is shot entirely too dark.. that's about the worst thing I can say about it though. As for plot predictability... how often do you REALLY see an original plotline?\n\nOne last comment. I was at the Army Officer's Advance Course when this movie came out. There was a group of Officer's that were gong to see this movie, ostensibly to have a good laugh. These were Ranger-qualified Infantry guys, a Marine officer from RECON, a couple guys going to or coming from SF training... all Type A's.

The Plot line is predictable, but it is the concepts that the director explores along the way that make it interesting an thought-provoking, assuming you pay attention and didn't just rent it for the bang-bang, or a chance to see Demi in a wet T-shirt. Ridley make some mistakes, but he does some really good things too. Let me comment on what some other people have said, and talk about what I think Ridley does well with this film.\n\nI think Mr. Scott gets a really excellent performance from Demi. I feel this is her best film, but I haven't seen to many, because she usually gets on my nerves. However, she is believable in the role of a woman who just wants to prove to herself that she can do this. I believe her when she says she doesn't want to be a poster child for women's rights... and the Commander is right in telling her that she's gonna have to wear that hat anyway.\n\nViggo is great too. I don't think too many people knew who he was when this movie came out, but he was even billed above Anne Bancroft. Someone said he looks embarrassed in every scene... hogwash. He looks like a very tough character in a very difficult situation. He knows that the issue is not whether a woman can make it, many can. This isn't about women's rights... this is about how men, mainly YOUNG men, relate to women in stressful situations. If all soldiers were in their late thirties, emotionally and psychologically, then the issue would be much smaller. Most of these guys are young, dumb and full of... you know the rhyme. I was there too, once upon a time. Viggo is excellent, he reacts the way many military instructors would... trying to stop the inevitable, fighting against politicians way over his head who have never been in the crap, but think they know better. Pay attention, you can just see that he respects LT O'Neil. But he believes he has to make an example out of her. Ms. Bancroft is excellent as well, some people say over the top, they obviously haven't had to deal with high level politics before. Perhaps she is a bit rough for reality, but remember, it is a movie, making a point, and being entertaining, things have to be gritty... and Senate will always be more vicious than any military training. I find her performance fun and a joy to watch.\n\nI don't know if Mr. Scott has any military training, but he does a better job of conveying the realities of it to the screen than most. Yes, the SERE segment goes farther than real SERE training would go... but not by much. Talk to someone who's been through it. It would not have been the same group of instructors... it's a very specialized field and the instructors have extensive psychological screening and training. However, I'll give that one to Ridley, he's trying not to complicate the plot, and he needs the scene with Master Chief Urgayle. BTW Women do go through SERE sometimes... and the instructors do use them against the men's emotions.\n\nAs for other Militray stuff, much of the language, feelings about chain of command, frustration with training constraints and political a**-covering was /On The Spot/. I speak from 6 years of experience as an Army officer (some of the stuff you see on active duty is amazing, but in the end it all balances out and the US Armed Forces are still the best in the world). Even the way Ridley has to frig with the plot to put the trainees in a an actual firefight was plausible... not possible, but plausible. Remember, it is a movie, he's got to have a real combat situation to entertain the dumber audience who just came to see the boom. But Ridley even goes far enough to give the Master Chief a chance to back out. It is a group of Navy SEAL trainees, deep into their training cycle, with a buttload of prior experience (IF you pay attention you will note that one of the trainees is a US Army Ranger, one a Marine, probably from RECON, these are guys who know the job already, and this is true to reality). You are also talking about a straight forward mission facilitating extraction of US Army Rangers from the deep inland mission. Ridley even has that right, this would be a Ranger mission, and the Spec-ops community may do a joint op where the SEALS secure the sea-side extraction point.\n\nQuite frankly... the movie is better than most people could have done. Matter of fact, I think it was a tough challenge for Mr. Scott and don't think anyone could have done much better. One bad point I agree with is that artistically, the movie is shot entirely too dark.. that's about the worst thing I can say about it though. As for plot predictability... how often do you REALLY see an original plotline?\n\nOne last comment. I was at the Army Officer's Advance Course when this movie came out. There was a group of Officer's that were gong to see this movie, ostensibly to have a good laugh. These were Ranger-qualified Infantry guys, a Marine officer from RECON, a couple guys going to or coming from SF training... all Type A's. The next day they weren't laughing... they just said "you know what, that wasn't half bad." That don't sound like much, but it's high praise from that group.\n\nProbably why this has such a poor rating is because it isn't Hollywood enough for the lowest-common-denominator crowd.\n\nEnjoy the film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77732,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1997-08-22","keywords":"feminism,military,training,strong female character,soldier","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"G.I.

It shows how DeNiro's character lives his life and his life is essential to the plot. "One more" is what he has been saying for years, but this time he means it and will do whatever it takes to make sure nothing goes wrong. Edward Norton's character gives Bob the most grief because he isn't sure if Norton will fly straight. Norton's performance is doubly magnificent and anyone who hasn't seen this actor in action is missing out big time. Brando delivers about 5 scenes that are right on key and provides some comic relief that fits nicely.

It shows how DeNiro's character lives his life and his life is essential to the plot. "One more" is what he has been saying for years, but this time he means it and will do whatever it takes to make sure nothing goes wrong. Edward Norton's character gives Bob the most grief because he isn't sure if Norton will fly straight. Norton's performance is doubly magnificent and anyone who hasn't seen this actor in action is missing out big time. Brando delivers about 5 scenes that are right on key and provides some comic relief that fits nicely. Overall a really good film that will leave audiences with their jaws on the floor.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":125165,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-12-26","keywords":"coffeeshop,confidence artist,hanging from the ceiling,infrared,cell phone","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000008/","name":"Marlon Brando"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000568/","name":"Frank Oz"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013922/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852196/","name":"Daniel E.

But their shared appearance is one best left open. ("I get a good vibe from these guys," the younger Hutch exclaims in one of the film's most savory self-referential moments.)\n\nThe film takes place in Bay City, "sometime during the '70s," when David Starsky (Stiller) -- a by-the-numbers police officer who spends his entire day chasing small-time crooks -- is paired up with a new partner, the reckless Ken "Hutch" Hutchinson (Wilson). Starsky and Hutch don't get along at first -- their mixed personalities collide, resulting in uncomfortable tension. Placed on an assignment involving an alleged drug lord (Vaughn), who has managed to create undetectable cocaine, Starsky and Hutch find themselves in a number of awkward situations: getting a statement by Big Earl (Ferrell), a dragon-obsessed inmate with some major issues; the usual tidbits of information from Huggy Bear (Dogg), a friend and informant of Hutch's; and of course the mandatory romantic subplot involving a pair of sexy cheerleaders.\n\nThe contrast of Starsky and Hutch is handled deliberately blunt: this comedy isn't as much a victim of the cop-buddy genre as it is a dead-on spoof. Hutch is a self-described "realist" -- during his introductory sequence he is shown fleeing the scene of a robbery with a stash of money. We assume he is undercover, and that's what he tells the cops when they try to arrest him. However, he's just using his badge as an excuse to commit crimes -- and get away with them.\n\nI asked myself if it was as possible as the film implies, but then the Constantly Yelling and/or Upset Police Captain (another clichéd role that happens to show up in all these movies) tells Hutch that it's the seventh time he's been arrested for robbery, and Hutch tells him that he's undercover -- trying to work his way in through the criminal underground. The joke, of course, is that we find out the robberies are all totally unrelated and bear no significant to a criminal underground of any kind.\n\nThere are a few sequences in the movie that deserve a description of their own, such as when Starsky accidentally consumes a large amount of cocaine and works himself into an ultimate-high-frenzy, battling on the disco floor of a nightclub for short-lived glory. After his opponent is unjustly awarded the gold medal, Starsky pulls out his gun and from there on the entire situation escalates into one of those scenes that -- like parts of Stiller's "There's Something About Mary" -- last on in viewers' minds even after the film itself fades away. The sort of sequence you might chuckle about to yourself as you drive home and recall certain moments from the film.\n\nStiller and Wilson -- presently two of Hollywood's most famous odd couples who have united together for a number of projects over the years -- are always likable in their films and nothing changes here. Wilson uses his sarcastic quips to an advantage, coming across as the smoother of the two, whereas Starsky is the bumbling and self-conscious idiot who is both over-protective and over-zealous.\n\nThe movie is at its best when it is cleverly satirizing the genre. Most of these films always include a sequence where the police captain will suspend the movie's protagonist and frown on him, saying something cheesy like, "Your father, who spent years on the force and was one of the highest-decorated officers, would be ashamed of you!" Instead, the police captain tells Starsky that his mother would be ashamed of him. And then after being suspended, Starsky takes a visit to his mother's grave and places a glazed donut on the headstone (she was the highly decorated cop in the family, apparently).\n\nThe film was directed by Todd Phillips, whose resume includes such raunchy efforts at comedy as the crude-but-enjoyable "Road Trip" and surprising "Old School." The latter film starred Ferrell and Vaughn and contained a cameo appearance by Snoop Dogg (as himself), so obviously these guys enjoyed working with Phillips and, I'm sure, agreed to contribute to this movie just for the heck of it.\n\nThe result is a very goofy, entertaining summer flick that never tries too hard and invariably never falls too hard, either. It does fall sometimes, but even then it usually takes its screw-ups with a pinch of salt. This is the sort of movie worth the price of admission -- just to sit back, forget your worries, and watch a couple of clowns bumble their way through an enjoyable farce of the '70s. It's not the kind of movie you'll be talking about after you see it -- just a simple popcorn flick. If you're out and about and you happen to stumble into a theater showing this film, you'll find your money well spent. I won't praise "Starsky and Hutch" for being a brilliant tongue-in-cheek spoof of the cop-buddy films -- I'll merely say that, for what it is, "Starsky and Hutch" is well-made and funny -- a surprisingly simple movie that is everything it pretends to be. The majority of films that use this approach suffer because they fall victim to their targets, especially most released this year, but where the others have failed "Starsky and Hutch" succeeds.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":143120,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2005-04-06","keywords":"character names as title,buddy movie,night club,1970s,russian roulette","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Starsky &amp; Hutch","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi25887001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q2NjI1OTYtMDJiNy00MDY2LWE0Y2EtY2E5ZDI2NTZjODU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q2NjI1OTYtMDJiNy00MDY2LWE0Y2EtY2E5ZDI2NTZjODU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Miramax"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004879/","name":"Snoop Dogg"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680846/","name":"Todd Phillips"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175068/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0088479/","name":"William Blinn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1192866/","name":"Stevie Long"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016088/","name":"John O'Brien"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But their shared appearance is one best left open. ("I get a good vibe from these guys," the younger Hutch exclaims in one of the film's most savory self-referential moments.)\n\nThe film takes place in Bay City, "sometime during the '70s," when David Starsky (Stiller) -- a by-the-numbers police officer who spends his entire day chasing small-time crooks -- is paired up with a new partner, the reckless Ken "Hutch" Hutchinson (Wilson). Starsky and Hutch don't get along at first -- their mixed personalities collide, resulting in uncomfortable tension. Placed on an assignment involving an alleged drug lord (Vaughn), who has managed to create undetectable cocaine, Starsky and Hutch find themselves in a number of awkward situations: getting a statement by Big Earl (Ferrell), a dragon-obsessed inmate with some major issues; the usual tidbits of information from Huggy Bear (Dogg), a friend and informant of Hutch's; and of course the mandatory romantic subplot involving a pair of sexy cheerleaders.\n\nThe contrast of Starsky and Hutch is handled deliberately blunt: this comedy isn't as much a victim of the cop-buddy genre as it is a dead-on spoof. Hutch is a self-described "realist" -- during his introductory sequence he is shown fleeing the scene of a robbery with a stash of money. We assume he is undercover, and that's what he tells the cops when they try to arrest him. However, he's just using his badge as an excuse to commit crimes -- and get away with them.\n\nI asked myself if it was as possible as the film implies, but then the Constantly Yelling and/or Upset Police Captain (another clichéd role that happens to show up in all these movies) tells Hutch that it's the seventh time he's been arrested for robbery, and Hutch tells him that he's undercover -- trying to work his way in through the criminal underground. The joke, of course, is that we find out the robberies are all totally unrelated and bear no significant to a criminal underground of any kind.\n\nThere are a few sequences in the movie that deserve a description of their own, such as when Starsky accidentally consumes a large amount of cocaine and works himself into an ultimate-high-frenzy, battling on the disco floor of a nightclub for short-lived glory. After his opponent is unjustly awarded the gold medal, Starsky pulls out his gun and from there on the entire situation escalates into one of those scenes that -- like parts of Stiller's "There's Something About Mary" -- last on in viewers' minds even after the film itself fades away. The sort of sequence you might chuckle about to yourself as you drive home and recall certain moments from the film.\n\nStiller and Wilson -- presently two of Hollywood's most famous odd couples who have united together for a number of projects over the years -- are always likable in their films and nothing changes here. Wilson uses his sarcastic quips to an advantage, coming across as the smoother of the two, whereas Starsky is the bumbling and self-conscious idiot who is both over-protective and over-zealous.\n\nThe movie is at its best when it is cleverly satirizing the genre. Most of these films always include a sequence where the police captain will suspend the movie's protagonist and frown on him, saying something cheesy like, "Your father, who spent years on the force and was one of the highest-decorated officers, would be ashamed of you!" Instead, the police captain tells Starsky that his mother would be ashamed of him. And then after being suspended, Starsky takes a visit to his mother's grave and places a glazed donut on the headstone (she was the highly decorated cop in the family, apparently).\n\nThe film was directed by Todd Phillips, whose resume includes such raunchy efforts at comedy as the crude-but-enjoyable "Road Trip" and surprising "Old School." The latter film starred Ferrell and Vaughn and contained a cameo appearance by Snoop Dogg (as himself), so obviously these guys enjoyed working with Phillips and, I'm sure, agreed to contribute to this movie just for the heck of it.\n\nThe result is a very goofy, entertaining summer flick that never tries too hard and invariably never falls too hard, either.

"The World Is Not Enough" was a debacle of miscasting and an an endless parade of meaningless subplots and tertiary characters.  "Die Another Day" suffered from much of the same, but was also saddled with an inexplicable amount of stereo feedback and one of the oddest (if catchiest) theme songs in recent memory.  The series has been re-energized with the new entry "The Cradle Of Life," a high-spirited, far-reaching film that doesn't quite succeed but is such an improvement on the originals that you're ready to overlook all that.\n\nActually, this is a review of "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life", the sequel to 2001's abysmally dull video-game-based film "Tomb Raider." Angelina Jolie is back as sexy, gun-toting archeologist Lara Croft, and at first glance, it's easy to mistake her for Bond, Jane Bond.  Lara is a British citizen of refined taste, highly competent in various forms of weaponry, travels around the globe to exotic locations, has friends (and lovers) in virtually every port, uses a wide variety of nifty gadgets, has an amusing yet dry form of wit, looks fabulous, and routinely saves the world from a madman bent on global domination.  She's a better 007 than Timothy Dalton in any case.\n\nThe film begins with Lara diving into a sunken temple off the coast of Greece.  While there, she is attacked by Chinese mercenaries, her support crew killed and left for dead, the mercenaries making off with a mysterious glowing orb.  Seems that mad scientist Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) is looking for Pandora's Box, and the orb is the key to finding it.  Lara is appointed by MI:6 with stopping Reiss because opening the box would unleash an amazingly nasty plague upon the world.  Besides her support staff of Hillary (Chris Barrie) and computer expert Bryce (Noah Taylor), Lara joins forces with ex-lover Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a shifty mercenary and the only person who knows how to get to the mercenaries who stole the orb in the first place.  And of course, time is running out.\n\nJolie is excellent as Lara Croft, and there probably isn't an actress around who would be better cast in the role.  Jolie has the physicality, the look, the voice, and the attitude to pull off the role effortlessly.  She was the only redeeming factor in the first film, and she's great to watch here. The supporting cast is a mixed bag.  Hinds refrains from chewing up too much of the scenery, but he brings to mind some of the more notable Bond villains of recent times.  Butler is great to look at, but his performance is far too low-key and deadpan for a movie as bombastic as this one wants to be, especially when he's paired with Jolie, who enters each seen with a relishing look in her eyes.  Taylor again acts as a dry kind of comic relief, and he displays far more chemistry with Jolie than Butler does.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements in this film is the director.  Replacing Simon West (responsible for the monotonous "Con Air") is Jan de Bont ("Speed"), a much more competent director even if some of his films are only barley entertaining ("The Haunting").  de Bont has a knack for action on a small scale, most vividly in a gun-fight staged in a laboratory/office, but his large scale pieces, like Lara body-gliding off of one of Hong Kong's tallest buildings, lack drama.  Still, de Bont has chosen good locations and sets for the film, and there is a blessedly welcome lack of the "Matrix"-style visuals and candy-colored bombast so popular in action films of recent memory.  He is nothing if not up to task.  The film operates well within its own set of rules and physics, unlike many other films that tend to sacrifice internal logic for cheap stunts.\n\nAs much of an improvement on the first film as this is, there are still flaws.  The script, while improving ten-fold on the original, still falls flat on several occasions, sometimes held up only by Jolie's confident line readings.  At almost two hours, the film displays a desperate need for tighter scenes and a quicker pace while simultaneously leaving some scenes cut too quickly.  The movie can be very easily divided into stages, which may hold true to the spirit of the video game's levels, but often leaves the audience doing nothing more than predicting when the DVD chapter cuts will occur in six months.  Also, like the James Bond films, there is rarely any doubt that Lara will escape any dire situation she finds herself in. Like 007, we always know the hero will prevail in the end, which robs some scenes of the tension needed to excite the audience.\n\nDespite some of these flaws, "The Cradle Of Life" is a fine movie and a good way to spend 2 hours on a summer afternoon.  Jolie obviously enjoys the role, and if nothing else, the film is worth it for that alone.  Here's hoping the third entry into the series is even better than the this one. 7 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":135160,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-24","keywords":"archeologist,based on video game,sequel,altered version of studio logo,eight word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lara Croft Tomb Raider Two: The Cradle of Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi143786265","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5YWJlNjMtNzNjNC00YjZmLWEwMDQtNDBhMmZjYWRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5YWJlNjMtNzNjNC00YjZmLWEwMDQtNDBhMmZjYWRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001401/","name":"Angelina Jolie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057368/","name":"Chris Barrie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000957/","name":"Jan de Bont"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007500/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212988/","name":"Dean Georgaris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211823/","name":"Steven E. de Souza"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366337/","name":"James V.

Here's hoping the third entry into the series is even better than the this one. 7 out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":135160,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-24","keywords":"archeologist,based on video game,sequel,altered version of studio logo,eight word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lara Croft Tomb Raider Two: The Cradle of Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi143786265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5YWJlNjMtNzNjNC00YjZmLWEwMDQtNDBhMmZjYWRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5YWJlNjMtNzNjNC00YjZmLWEwMDQtNDBhMmZjYWRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001401/","name":"Angelina Jolie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057368/","name":"Chris Barrie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000957/","name":"Jan de Bont"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007500/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212988/","name":"Dean Georgaris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211823/","name":"Steven E. de Souza","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366337/","name":"James V.

It felt like every song on the soundtrack was one of hers. If you're a huge fan and never get tired of her, take it as a treat. Otherwise it is excessive. It'd be fine with a couple songs, and maybe one more playing on their TV or radio, but as the only music at all?\n\n\n\n* The morals were very impressive. But somehow, in some very strange way, they felt miss-able, even though they were right there, highlighted. It may have been partly due to the movie feeling slightly detached. I'm not sure how else to put it. And... all the excessive distracting Rihanna. In important scenes I felt myself paying more attention to the fact that it was another one of her songs playing, again. Shes definitely not a bad artist, and I don't dislike her. Even if it was one of my favorite bands instead, I'd probably feel the same, hoping they play something else.\n\n\nThe movie had a lot of highly creative elements, which I always appreciate in an animated film. Dreamsworks does a fine job with its characterization as always, even with Tip coming out with a character trait we all saw coming (every single movie has one.) The antagonists and lessons were great, how the characters treaded the planet's 'renovation' was fun to watch. The relationships and character growth was exceptionally well done.\n\nI'd give it a 6.5, but no decimals. It was there, yet it also wasn't? I'd still watch it again. Just takes a little push for this movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":97448,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-03-25","keywords":"alien,human,friendship,interspecies friendship,outer space","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Feel The Light (From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, Home)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2222961433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTExMjQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc1NDM5NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTExMjQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc1NDM5NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Music video by Jennifer Lopez performing Feel The Light (From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, Home).

It felt like every song on the soundtrack was one of hers. If you're a huge fan and never get tired of her, take it as a treat. Otherwise it is excessive. It'd be fine with a couple songs, and maybe one more playing on their TV or radio, but as the only music at all?\n\n\n\n* The morals were very impressive. But somehow, in some very strange way, they felt miss-able, even though they were right there, highlighted. It may have been partly due to the movie feeling slightly detached. I'm not sure how else to put it. And... all the excessive distracting Rihanna. In important scenes I felt myself paying more attention to the fact that it was another one of her songs playing, again. Shes definitely not a bad artist, and I don't dislike her. Even if it was one of my favorite bands instead, I'd probably feel the same, hoping they play something else.\n\n\nThe movie had a lot of highly creative elements, which I always appreciate in an animated film. Dreamsworks does a fine job with its characterization as always, even with Tip coming out with a character trait we all saw coming (every single movie has one.) The antagonists and lessons were great, how the characters treaded the planet's 'renovation' was fun to watch. The relationships and character growth was exceptionally well done.\n\nI'd give it a 6.5, but no decimals. It was there, yet it also wasn't? I'd still watch it again. Just takes a little push for this movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":97448,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-03-25","keywords":"alien,human,friendship,interspecies friendship,outer space","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Feel The Light (From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, Home)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2222961433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTExMjQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc1NDM5NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTExMjQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc1NDM5NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Music video by Jennifer Lopez performing Feel The Light (From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, Home).

Kevin Kline is perfectly cast in spirit as the songwriter extraordinaire who stormed Broadway as Hollywood beckoned. His marriage to Linda Porter (a terrific Ashley Judd) is a relationship of lasting love fraught with infidelity and heartbreak in which Porter is portrayed as an insatiable artist whose homoerotic dalliances were legend. The timeline spans the 1920's through the 1950's. This is not so much a simple biopic but, rather, an interesting depiction of Porter's constant struggle to find happiness in love and life and it proves to be an addictive intoxication. As his accepting and understanding wife grows increasingly frustrated with his lies and deception amid his growing list of male suitors, Porter's life and health begin to unravel. \n\nServing as a framework for the life events is a curious narration of sorts by an aged Porter and a mysterious host/angel (a nice theatrical turn by Jonathan Pryce). This bracketing narration is reminiscent of A Christmas Carol, and there are striking similarities to the classic All That Jazz in narrative and tone. The main story is told in a series of mini-vignettes; some scenes are almost too brief. Then there are the songs. It is truly phenomenal just how many wonderful Porter songs became standards. The recreations of many of his top hits are interspersed throughout the film and are performed often by top vocalists including some amusing cameos by Elvis Costello, Diana Krall, Alanis Morissette, and Natalie Cole. The songs serve to parallel and punctuate the life events throughout the story in much the same way paintings served as a co-narrative in Frieda.\n\nAlthough production values are good for a period and location piece, it feels a little less grand in scope than it ought to be. Perhaps that works in the films favor as a more intimate story. Standout credit goes to the makeup effects especially showing the aging of Kevin Kline's character. The camera work and editing are imaginative especially in a series of circular tracking shots which seamlessly meld one timeframe with another. The music is timeless and enjoyable even when sung in pedestrian fashion by Kline. And regarding Kline, he deserves an Oscar nomination for a richly etched portrait of a tortured soul whose search for true love spanned his entire life. Perhaps in the hands of Bob Fosse or Baz Luhrmann, this could have really launched into a wildly imaginative send-off of a musical genius, but director Irwin Winkler (a respected producer turned director like Alan Pakula) has done Cole Porter proud."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11195,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2004-08-06","keywords":"jukebox musical,horseback riding,cole porter character,monty woolley character,louis b. mayer character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4233871641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000177/","name":"Kevin Kline"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000171/","name":"Ashley Judd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098170/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049390/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168379/","name":"Jay Cocks"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

No one series has ever made me laugh and cry so much.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114089,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-06-06","keywords":"friendship between women,friendship,love life,casual sex,new york city","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000326/","name":"Kim Cattrall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004862/","name":"Kristin Davis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020963/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050436/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823015/","name":"Darren Star"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sex and the City: The Sixth Season - Part 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi394723609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Worst yet, in the end PT never takes a stance on Margot, like the movie is trying to have its cake and eat it too.

It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades.

Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":691185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's interesting to have this movie's versions of the old movie. McGregor is great and the girl is great. Rebecca Ferguson is very interesting as a villain.

For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?\n\nThis film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I'm still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I'd say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the "real" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That's a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn't even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento's soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.\n\nI have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there's some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out "form of a gundam" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn't been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn't. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky ("Oh God, it's f*%@ing Chucky" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).\n\nBut to say that this is nothing but leaching off others' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.\n\nThe characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \n\n And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"player,based on novel,screenplay adapted by author,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

Just in case you have forgotten, the movie does remind you just how wicked teenage girls can be ... even the good ones. The film centers around the annual family reunion at the parents' (Dianne Weist, John Mahoney) beautiful summer house in Rhode Island.

Odd casting does help.\n\nDane Cook and Emily Blunt have supporting roles that are both very well done. Personally I find it difficult to ever really like Dane Cook, but he controls his freak pretty well here. Ms. Blunt is a budding star (see "The Devil Wears Prada") and sooner or later, Hollywood will find the right roles to showcase her talents. By far the most outside the box casting occurs with Juliette Binoche in the pivotal role of Marie. Not to give too much away, but she does give new meaning to brotherly love.\n\nCarell is fine and at least isn't falling into the one-trick pony career of Ben Stiller. He does have some range as an actor and hopefully will mix in a few dramas with the slapstick.

Alfonso Cuaron, already a well-appreciated Director of artistic genius, takes us on this incredible journey with Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), who gets detached from her shuttle and has to find her way back home (towards Gravity). The harrowing situation itself is stupefying; the stunning visuals, the incredible acting, and the powerful background score just add to the horror. In this era of 3D movies, this is one of the few movies where the 3D effect actually contributes something to the storytelling aspect, as well as the gripping reality of the film. For most of us, this is the closest we can ever get to be in space; it suspends us in a state of weightlessness along with the jeopardized astronauts. \n\nThe acting by the lead, Sandra Bullock, is commendable; the natural portrayal of the character makes the situation more realistic. She single-handedly caries the movie on her shoulders.

Alfonso Cuaron, already a well-appreciated Director of artistic genius, takes us on this incredible journey with Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), who gets detached from her shuttle and has to find her way back home (towards Gravity). The harrowing situation itself is stupefying; the stunning visuals, the incredible acting, and the powerful background score just add to the horror. In this era of 3D movies, this is one of the few movies where the 3D effect actually contributes something to the storytelling aspect, as well as the gripping reality of the film. For most of us, this is the closest we can ever get to be in space; it suspends us in a state of weightlessness along with the jeopardized astronauts. \n\nThe acting by the lead, Sandra Bullock, is commendable; the natural portrayal of the character makes the situation more realistic. She single-handedly caries the movie on her shoulders. The well-timed bouts of humour by George Clooney's supporting character, the veteran astronaut Mathew Kowalsky, give us the only comic relief in an otherwise gloomy suspense thriller. The cameo by the ecstatic Indian astronaut singing around "Mera jootha hai Japani" in space was hilarious as well. \n\nOther than being an adventurous suspense thriller, the slow character- development helps us to form an emotional bond as well.

For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?\n\nThis film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I'm still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I'd say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the "real" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That's a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn't even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento's soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.\n\nI have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there's some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out "form of a gundam" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn't been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn't. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky ("Oh God, it's f*%@ing Chucky" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).\n\nBut to say that this is nothing but leaching off others' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.\n\nThe characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \n\n And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"player,based on novel,screenplay adapted by author,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

Although Soderbergh is frequently the director, cinematography and editor on his projects, he may be efficient but he's far too clinical, pushing the audience as an observer that it's difficult to feel emotionally involved in his films. I can't get excited for his half-baked premises that most likely haven't been fulfilled to their potential. However, Behind The Candelabra may be the first film I've seen of his that suits his style ideally. His style is still distant and voyeuristic, but in this bizarre world where Liberace adopts his lover for a son and pays for plastic surgery to make him look like himself, it feels more deliberate to keep us at a distance.\n\nInstead, the scenes of dramatic conflict, decision and choice are played off for jokes and it's really effective, always earning belly laughs with its brilliant one-liners without feeling like it's silly. Perhaps its nervous laughter but it makes for an entertaining and interesting film. Michael Douglas is terrific as Liberace. I've never seen him take a character on like this. He's nearly up there with Sean Penn's Milk. It feels like it's been a while since Matt Damon has been in films I've wanted to watch and with this and Elysium, I've forgotten how reliable a lead he is. The characters inhabit a flashy world, but its kept on the costumes and sets which are incidental more than anything and the style of the film is kept subtle, besides a great choice of swooping cameras.

Director Peter Hedges' best work is "Pieces of April", a very edgy family drama/comedy that I have recommended to many. Although "Dan in Real Life" doesn't possess anywhere near the edginess of that film, it is an entertaining film with some clever moments ... though it is much more mainstream (by design).\n\nSteve Carell stars as Dan, a widower father of three daughters. Just in case you have forgotten, the movie does remind you just how wicked teenage girls can be ... even the good ones. The film centers around the annual family reunion at the parents' (Dianne Weist, John Mahoney) beautiful summer house in Rhode Island. Although the film borrows material from many large family comdrams, there are a handful of moments and lines that prevent it from being a total remix. Odd casting does help.\n\nDane Cook and Emily Blunt have supporting roles that are both very well done. Personally I find it difficult to ever really like Dane Cook, but he controls his freak pretty well here. Ms. Blunt is a budding star (see "The Devil Wears Prada") and sooner or later, Hollywood will find the right roles to showcase her talents. By far the most outside the box casting occurs with Juliette Binoche in the pivotal role of Marie.

Director Peter Hedges' best work is "Pieces of April", a very edgy family drama/comedy that I have recommended to many. Although "Dan in Real Life" doesn't possess anywhere near the edginess of that film, it is an entertaining film with some clever moments ... though it is much more mainstream (by design).\n\nSteve Carell stars as Dan, a widower father of three daughters. Just in case you have forgotten, the movie does remind you just how wicked teenage girls can be ... even the good ones. The film centers around the annual family reunion at the parents' (Dianne Weist, John Mahoney) beautiful summer house in Rhode Island. Although the film borrows material from many large family comdrams, there are a handful of moments and lines that prevent it from being a total remix. Odd casting does help.\n\nDane Cook and Emily Blunt have supporting roles that are both very well done. Personally I find it difficult to ever really like Dane Cook, but he controls his freak pretty well here. Ms. Blunt is a budding star (see "The Devil Wears Prada") and sooner or later, Hollywood will find the right roles to showcase her talents. By far the most outside the box casting occurs with Juliette Binoche in the pivotal role of Marie. Not to give too much away, but she does give new meaning to brotherly love.\n\nCarell is fine and at least isn't falling into the one-trick pony career of Ben Stiller. He does have some range as an actor and hopefully will mix in a few dramas with the slapstick. Wouldn't call this anything close to a classic, but it is a movie families (not the youngsters) can watch together and be entertained ... nothing wrong with that.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).\n\nThe acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.\n\nThe special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.\n\nWhat's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect.

Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.\n\nNow about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).\n\nThe acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.\n\nThe special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.\n\nWhat's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1737126,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-03-13","keywords":"ring,quest,hobbit,middle earth,epic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089217/","name":"Orlando Bloom"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

By now we are all aware of the story of how Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky in three days after watching a fight between an extreme underdog and a highly favoured champ.  Stallone was a nobody back then yet he still stood his ground and didn't sell out to the producers until they promised him the title role.  The rest they say is history.  Well 9 years later, after three Rocky films, in my opinion comes the best one.  I realize that Rocky was all story and then a climatic boxing match and that is what won the film the Oscar.  And even though I can admit that this film is not as concerned with character developement as it is with training montages and bulging muscles, it is by far and away the most entertaining film of the 5.  And that is what I enjoy about the film.  I love that Rocky IV has some of the best training montages ever filmed.  I love that it has the heart of a lion when it shows Rocky scaling a mountain that you know damn well he shouldn't be able to.  And I absolutely love the boxing match at the end of the film.  This was completely choreographed by Stallone and he and Dolph Lundgren boxed for real for about 75% of the match.  Stallone felt that it needed some authenticity so that was the way to do it.  And if you think Robert De Niro is an impressive method actor, try this fact on for size.  When filming the boxing match, some of the scenes were so real that Stallone was rushed to hospital because his heart was actually pushed up and his ribcage was slightly shattered.  So when you watch that match at the end, just know that what you are seeing is not exactly choreography and trick camera work.  They did the best job they could to keep the look of the fight as real as possible.  And I think this is the best boxing match ever filmed, with all due respect to Raging Bull. \n\n Stallone was in the shape of his life in this year as he filmed Rocky and Rambo back to back and it shows.  I have never seen a more sculpted man in the movies than he was here.  And I think that added to his superman persona.  If you notice in all the Rocky films, he grows a little each time. And that also adds to the enjoyment of the film.  \n\nRocky IV is different than Rocky, there is no doubt.  And as much as I love the first one, it doesn't come close to entertaining me as much as this one does.  Rocky IV starts fast and it ends hard and in between we are blessed with a great soundtrack and a beautiful montage of all the Rocky films to Robert Tepper's "There's No Easy Way Out"  And it is here that even though some will say that Stallone has substituted real human emotion with an MTV ersatz video, I think it works well.  There is nothing about this film that I didn't enjoy and if you forget what the experience of watching this one is like, I suggest that you rent it now and take a look at it.  And try to remember what it was like when you first saw this film back in the winter of 85.  I remember I was in Kokomo Indiana visiting family for Christmas.  My mom and I walked into a packed theater and you want to talk about a place erupting like a volcano, then this was the place.  When Rocky finally hits Drago to cut him over the eye and Duke yells " he's cut, he's cut! "  the crowd went into a frenzy.  And you can look no further than that as to why the Rocky films were so popular.  It doesn't matter if you are Canadian, American, Portuguese, Polish or Dutch or whatever, Rocky appeals to all of us.  Because all of us have been the underdog at some time in our lives and we love to watch him and perhaps live vicariously through him.  That is the beauty of Rocky.

By now we are all aware of the story of how Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky in three days after watching a fight between an extreme underdog and a highly favoured champ.  Stallone was a nobody back then yet he still stood his ground and didn't sell out to the producers until they promised him the title role.  The rest they say is history.  Well 9 years later, after three Rocky films, in my opinion comes the best one.  I realize that Rocky was all story and then a climatic boxing match and that is what won the film the Oscar.  And even though I can admit that this film is not as concerned with character developement as it is with training montages and bulging muscles, it is by far and away the most entertaining film of the 5.  And that is what I enjoy about the film.  I love that Rocky IV has some of the best training montages ever filmed.  I love that it has the heart of a lion when it shows Rocky scaling a mountain that you know damn well he shouldn't be able to.  And I absolutely love the boxing match at the end of the film.  This was completely choreographed by Stallone and he and Dolph Lundgren boxed for real for about 75% of the match.  Stallone felt that it needed some authenticity so that was the way to do it.  And if you think Robert De Niro is an impressive method actor, try this fact on for size.  When filming the boxing match, some of the scenes were so real that Stallone was rushed to hospital because his heart was actually pushed up and his ribcage was slightly shattered.  So when you watch that match at the end, just know that what you are seeing is not exactly choreography and trick camera work.  They did the best job they could to keep the look of the fight as real as possible.  And I think this is the best boxing match ever filmed, with all due respect to Raging Bull. \n\n Stallone was in the shape of his life in this year as he filmed Rocky and Rambo back to back and it shows.  I have never seen a more sculpted man in the movies than he was here.  And I think that added to his superman persona.  If you notice in all the Rocky films, he grows a little each time. And that also adds to the enjoyment of the film.  \n\nRocky IV is different than Rocky, there is no doubt.  And as much as I love the first one, it doesn't come close to entertaining me as much as this one does.  Rocky IV starts fast and it ends hard and in between we are blessed with a great soundtrack and a beautiful montage of all the Rocky films to Robert Tepper's "There's No Easy Way Out"  And it is here that even though some will say that Stallone has substituted real human emotion with an MTV ersatz video, I think it works well.  There is nothing about this film that I didn't enjoy and if you forget what the experience of watching this one is like, I suggest that you rent it now and take a look at it.  And try to remember what it was like when you first saw this film back in the winter of 85.  I remember I was in Kokomo Indiana visiting family for Christmas.  My mom and I walked into a packed theater and you want to talk about a place erupting like a volcano, then this was the place.  When Rocky finally hits Drago to cut him over the eye and Duke yells " he's cut, he's cut! "  the crowd went into a frenzy.  And you can look no further than that as to why the Rocky films were so popular.  It doesn't matter if you are Canadian, American, Portuguese, Polish or Dutch or whatever, Rocky appeals to all of us.  Because all of us have been the underdog at some time in our lives and we love to watch him and perhaps live vicariously through him.  That is the beauty of Rocky.  If Rocky can do it then dammit so can I! \n\n When the movie ended on that cold night back in 1985, and people were filtering out to their cars for the drive home, I swear I could hear the crowd chanting his name, as did the millions..... and millions of the Rock's fans.  \n\n" Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!"","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":195327,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1985-11-27","keywords":"training montage,boxing,coming out of retirement,cutting down a tree,loss of friend","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Rocky IV","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3266298649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRiNzljNmMtYTQwYi00NGE5LTg0YmYtZDY1YzY1MTEyODAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWRiNzljNmMtYTQwYi00NGE5LTg0YmYtZDY1YzY1MTEyODAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054262/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Brilliant.\n\nDirector David Yates, who also directed the 5th, 6th and 7th films is back to direct the final. This pleases me because these 3 films are my personal favourites out of the 7 that have come out so far so I think it's fair to say that I was expecting big things from this. I'm very pleased to say that he's pulled it off ending the series in a fast paced, well written final act.\n\nThe film (in case you're wondering) picks up straight after where Part 1 ended, Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) has the most powerful wand in his possession and he's finally ready to succeed in what he tried to do over 15 years ago. He finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. I won't go into much more detail in what happens as most people will have read the book and I don't want to drop spoilers! Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) need to seek out and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. This is the only way that will give them a chance of stopping He Who Must Not Be Named.\n\nTheir final journey takes them to places we may not have seen recently or remembered, places such as Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Along the way they encounter a variety of creatures, both friend and foe from dragons to spiders, death eaters to old friends and of course, the Dark Lord himself. Will Voldemort Succeed? Or will good trump evil? For those who haven't read the book this is your chance to find out.\n\nWhat I especially love about this film and Part 1 is the direction in which they've taken, adding more cheesy lines and (for example in Part 1) that dance sequence. I feel that these small touches bring the films closer to our hearts and help us to connect with the film a lot more. Sure they leave out a lot of information that the books provide but that's the same with all film adaptations! They've got the main story down and where they've deviated from the book it has been for the best. Not everything written down on paper will translate into visually appealing footage.\n\nPart 1 to me also felt unfinished (well it was only half the book I suppose!), I mean in the way that it was long and never seemed to climax. Sure at the end of Part 1 Voldemort gets the want he so badly seeks for and leaves then the films ends on a giant cliffhanger. Part 2 definitely adds the rest of that epicness that so many other films have towards the end. It's full of action! I definitely believe that both Part 1 and 2 are best viewed with a short as possible gap in between them. Otherwise it's like watching the first disc from one of the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings and not watching the second disc for another 6 months!\n\nThis paragraph is about the visuals and 3D. Skip to the final paragraph for final thoughts.\n\nVisually the film is stunning from an effects point of view. From the trailer alone you can see that this film has quite a lot of action in it, crumbling buildings, hundreds of spells and lots of fire. Everything looks great, from the wand duals to the dragons it all is fantastic. Also this time around it is being showed in 3D and is the first (and (probably) last!) potter film to be shown in this way. Now I was very sceptical about this, especially since they announced that the films (originally both parts) would be converted from 2D to 3D instead of being natively filmed in 3D. I believe that what they should have done was what they did with Part 1, scrap the 3D. I'm going to say that it's not great, at times it's pretty good, but never great. For the most part it's okay. I'm going to compare it with the last blockbuster film to come out in 3D, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The 3D effect is not even close to looking as good as what that film (shot in 3D) had. So I'm going to tell you now, 2D is the best dimension to watch this film in. Having said that if you still want to (or have to) see it in 3D by all means do, the 3D doesn't take away anything from the film, but it doesn't add much.\n\nI will end by saying that I definitely recommend this film for everyone, especially Potter fans. The ending that many thought could easily be done wrongly has been done right. Then when you think of Part 1 and 2 as the same film I believe that they are easily the best Potter films. This truly is a fitting ending for the boy who lived.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":805903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Fantasy","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2011-07-13","keywords":"ginny weasley character,lucius malfoy character,hermione granger character,twins,child","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi128621593","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcwODM5NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA4MTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcwODM5NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA4MTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The end begins as Harry, Ron, and Hermione go back to Hogwarts to find and destroy Voldemort's final horcruxes, but when Voldemort finds out about their mission, the biggest battle begins and life as they know it will never be the same again.

Brilliant.\n\nDirector David Yates, who also directed the 5th, 6th and 7th films is back to direct the final. This pleases me because these 3 films are my personal favourites out of the 7 that have come out so far so I think it's fair to say that I was expecting big things from this. I'm very pleased to say that he's pulled it off ending the series in a fast paced, well written final act.\n\nThe film (in case you're wondering) picks up straight after where Part 1 ended, Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) has the most powerful wand in his possession and he's finally ready to succeed in what he tried to do over 15 years ago. He finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. I won't go into much more detail in what happens as most people will have read the book and I don't want to drop spoilers! Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) need to seek out and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. This is the only way that will give them a chance of stopping He Who Must Not Be Named.\n\nTheir final journey takes them to places we may not have seen recently or remembered, places such as Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Along the way they encounter a variety of creatures, both friend and foe from dragons to spiders, death eaters to old friends and of course, the Dark Lord himself. Will Voldemort Succeed? Or will good trump evil? For those who haven't read the book this is your chance to find out.\n\nWhat I especially love about this film and Part 1 is the direction in which they've taken, adding more cheesy lines and (for example in Part 1) that dance sequence. I feel that these small touches bring the films closer to our hearts and help us to connect with the film a lot more. Sure they leave out a lot of information that the books provide but that's the same with all film adaptations! They've got the main story down and where they've deviated from the book it has been for the best. Not everything written down on paper will translate into visually appealing footage.\n\nPart 1 to me also felt unfinished (well it was only half the book I suppose!), I mean in the way that it was long and never seemed to climax. Sure at the end of Part 1 Voldemort gets the want he so badly seeks for and leaves then the films ends on a giant cliffhanger. Part 2 definitely adds the rest of that epicness that so many other films have towards the end. It's full of action! I definitely believe that both Part 1 and 2 are best viewed with a short as possible gap in between them. Otherwise it's like watching the first disc from one of the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings and not watching the second disc for another 6 months!\n\nThis paragraph is about the visuals and 3D. Skip to the final paragraph for final thoughts.\n\nVisually the film is stunning from an effects point of view. From the trailer alone you can see that this film has quite a lot of action in it, crumbling buildings, hundreds of spells and lots of fire. Everything looks great, from the wand duals to the dragons it all is fantastic. Also this time around it is being showed in 3D and is the first (and (probably) last!) potter film to be shown in this way. Now I was very sceptical about this, especially since they announced that the films (originally both parts) would be converted from 2D to 3D instead of being natively filmed in 3D. I believe that what they should have done was what they did with Part 1, scrap the 3D. I'm going to say that it's not great, at times it's pretty good, but never great. For the most part it's okay. I'm going to compare it with the last blockbuster film to come out in 3D, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The 3D effect is not even close to looking as good as what that film (shot in 3D) had. So I'm going to tell you now, 2D is the best dimension to watch this film in. Having said that if you still want to (or have to) see it in 3D by all means do, the 3D doesn't take away anything from the film, but it doesn't add much.\n\nI will end by saying that I definitely recommend this film for everyone, especially Potter fans. The ending that many thought could easily be done wrongly has been done right. Then when you think of Part 1 and 2 as the same film I believe that they are easily the best Potter films. This truly is a fitting ending for the boy who lived.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":805903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Fantasy","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2011-07-13","keywords":"ginny weasley character,lucius malfoy character,hermione granger character,twins,child","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi128621593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcwODM5NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA4MTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcwODM5NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA4MTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The end begins as Harry, Ron, and Hermione go back to Hogwarts to find and destroy Voldemort's final horcruxes, but when Voldemort finds out about their mission, the biggest battle begins and life as they know it will never be the same again.

Zootopia is a big city over there. Like its name, this city contains all animal characters such a zoo as well. We can find so many animal characters here and of course they bring their own characteristics. They are rabbits, foxes, goats, sheeps, wolfs, lion, sheep, rhinoceros, and any others. And the main character is a bunny or we know it as a rabbit called Judy Hopps. Ya, just a little rabbit who has wanted to be a policewoman since she was child while there was no rabbit be police. There is no matter if the citizen are just rabbits, but the problem is the citizen are not only rabbits but all of animals are over there. There are many big and strong animals such rhinoceros or lions who are more appropriate to be police than just a bunny. She had been underestimated by every one for dreaming to be police, even by her parents. But it was not a problem for her, even she must pass many difficulties, she just kept trying and trying and finally she got appreciation to be the best police since she could finish a mission of a case and found something new on it.\n\n1. Animation The animation moving is very smooth such as another 3D animation movie. The characters are drawn well, suit to their characteristic. We can know directly how is a character's feature even just see them, not watch them. It run a same way when some characters turn characteristic, from good to bad or vice versa, we can know it directly by their expression. It eases children to know how feature of the characters are, so they won't be confused by watching this movie especially when some characters change their appanage. This movie has a beautiful color, contras but still in harmony and it makes gazer, from children to adult, be able to enjoy this movie well. 2. Score For me, every single sound in this movie is nice, very nice. From the dubbing, sound effect, and of course the sound track. The sound track, Try Everything by Shakira, is very representative that movie and it suits when it played while Judy Hopps was enjoying her journey from her hometown to Zootopia. So, we, as gazer, can enjoy both of picture and the song. 3. Plot twist This is the most unexpected part of this movie when Mrs. Bellwether changed into a bad character. In the beginning, she was very good and helpful to Judy, but it turned out that she was a mastermind of all of "disaster" in the movie. This part gives us some breaks when we have a bit been bored think who is the mastermind of the problem. 4. Moral Value Same as its soundtrack, this movie reminds us not to give up on everything, just keep trying and trying, trying everything and making something new. Life is all about problems, problems always come and leave. One problem has been solved and another problem will come to us, of course, that's a life. And for facing our problem, just ignore people say for braking our dream, just keep trying and prove that we can do for reaching our dream. And don't be afraid to fall on our journey, believe in ourselves that we can, we can, and we can. This movie was very impressive to me when I watched in 2016, I was in senior high school. I had a dream that it was very difficult for me at that time. It made me doubt that I could reach my dream. By watching this movie, I cried and created an advice for my own, "Believe in yourself that you can reach what you want as long as you want to try more, more and more, nothing impossible in this world." Moreover, the plot twist reminds us for not to ease believing someone and not to judge a book by its cover.\n\nFor me, this movie has almost no lack. This film is very recommended for watching by everyone, from children to adult, even elderly, because of its own picture and its value. For children who haven't been able to understand the value, they can enjoy the beautiful picture, the cute characters and moments, and of course the song.

McBride će glumiti glavni lik Jesseja Gemstonea, koji sebe smatra osobenjakom među propovjednicima preuzevši ono što je njegov otac Eli Gemstone (John Goodman) izgradio i proširivši to za moderniju publiku.

KAD PADNE MRAK u dokumentarnom stilu prikazuje svakodnevan (odnosno, svakonoćni) život troje vampira koji zajedno "žive" stotinama godina. Na Staten Islandu.

A group of people in an abandoned steel mill (it doesnt even look like a steel mill, it looks interesting, but steel wasnt produced on that site) setting it up for a live role playing game, then spooky things start to happen.\n\nThe plot is full of holes (if you had an abandoned secret research facility why would you rent it out to a bunch of inquisitive LARPERS?), the science is equally unlikely (transferring "souls") All the characters are completely unlikeable, they are either using each other, or sleeping with each other, or ignoring bad things that are happening, there is quite literally nobody to root for.\n\nThe one character I did like, because he was handsome and had a jersey I would like to own (yes, reasons to like characters in this series are just. That. Tenuous...) ends up dead.\n\nIt may have worked as a film, but theres just not enough matrerial here for a series, if you edited the whole thing down to an hour and a half it would still be an mediocre "ok one of those" films you watch on a friday night when you cant be bothered going out and dont want to think too much..","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2266,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2021-06-13","keywords":"lesbian kiss,lesbian sex,topless female nudity,larp,larpers","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11198177/","name":"Lola Zackow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4477198/","name":"Madeleine Martin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7154476/","name":"Johan Hafezi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004517/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You've got one of the most beloved films in your entire catalogue; the first animated film ever that was nominated for a best picture Oscar - and you give the new version of that film to the director of 'Twilight' parts 3 and 4? Has anyone of your executives even seen Bill Condon's 'Twilight' films or did you just look at all the money they made during their opening weekend? Just so you know: those films are atrocious. There are porn films who look better and have better plots (seriously).\n\nNow the good news is, 'Beauty and the Beast' is nowhere near as bad as the Twilight films, but it DOES bear a striking visual resemblance to those teen shlock movies. And that's what I don't get: if you have the chance to make a film that will make 1.5 billion dollars (given the reviews are good) - wouldn't you want to make sure to make the best looking film possible? But over large stretches this film has the mediocre looking CGI of a cheap Lionsgate fantasy film and the nuanced color-grading of a bowl of M&amp;Ms.\n\nEmma Watson isn't half bad as Belle, but her acting feels forced in a way you can practically read the directions she gets from her director on her face ("now act SURPRISED" - "now show us a sense of WONDER" - "now look SAD"). Great actors like Kevin Kline are simply wasted because they have nothing to do besides just being there and have a certain look. The one actor who makes something of his role is, naturally, the one who plays the baddie; Luke Evans at least looks like he's having fun.\n\nBut all that is still not the worst. What sank the film for me was Beast. It's mind-boggling to me how a gigantic company like Disney lets a film open if the most important CGI effects obviously don't look convincing yet. Beast's face never looks real and that's just not acceptable. It's been almost 10 years since we got a completely convincing CGI "beast" face with Peter Jackson's King Kong, complete with alive looking eyes and natural facial expressions. Since then we got films like 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Jungle Book' that looked even better and more realistic. So what happened? What did they spend the 200 million budget on?\n\nI'm sorry to say it, but this film represents a huge missed opportunity for Disney.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":289262,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-03-17","keywords":"beast,fairy tale,heroine,beast's heart,remake of oscar winner","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For Your Consideration Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179222553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As punishment for his actions, a young prince is transformed into a monstrous beast by a mysterious enchantress.

So with new writers (Simon Pegg and Doug Jung) and a new director (Justin Lin, known for directing some of the Fast and Furious films) is Star Trek Beyond able to recapture the original feeling of Star Trek? Yes, it more than does this. In fact this ,the third film in the new series of Star Trek movies, feels like an extended episode from the original series. There is a lot of fun to be had with this film and in all honesty it might actually have a running time that is just over two hours but when watching it the pace is so fast and the action is so well shot the running time only seems to be just over 45 minutes. Another thing that new director Lin has been able to successfully do is bring the audience into the actual adventure, the audience doesn't just watch the film they are almost taking part, they are made to feel as if they are in the same world, the exact same situations as the characters causing them to not only laugh along with them when there are comedic moments ,which nearly always hit the right mark, but also feel involved in the action and the adventure. The chemistry between all the characters is always on top form and all actors clearly get on well making the on screen chemistry more realistic especially between Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Bones (Karl Urban). The characters of Spock and Bones ,helped by Pegg and Jung's script, go together so well creating a really well thought out and timed double act while still keeping the frame of the original characters, still providing the much needed action and adventure that is vital to this sort of film. As for the Visual Effects ,next to Ghostbusters, they are some of the best to be seen on the big screen this year and go towards creating an even greater sense of realism and once again pulling the audience in with immense ease.\n\nFans will be pleased by this new entry into the Star Trek series, because Star Trek Beyond not only feels like a successful extended episode but the acting, story, characters, action, effects and so much more go towards creating a fun, crowd pleasing sci-fi adventure.\n\n**** &lt;-- Four Stars","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":237315,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-07-21","keywords":"star trek,third part,alien,stranded,sequel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi354465561","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODk2NzY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI1Mjc0OTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODk2NzY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI1Mjc0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The USS Enterprise crew explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a new ruthless enemy who puts them and everything the Federation stands for to the test."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0704270/","name":"Zachary Quinto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881631/","name":"Karl Urban"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510912/","name":"Justin Lin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0708328/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0670408/","name":"Simon Pegg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1136647/","name":"Doug Jung"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734472/","name":"Gene Roddenberry"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you want mindless techno-babble, then this show isn't for you. 2. If you don't manage to appreciate what good... no, let me rephrase that for you: exquisite acting is, then you definitely shouldn't watch it. 3. If you expect to have a crew of four, including a science doctor, an alien, a military and some random Indiana Jones guy, all of them solving new let's-save-the-Earth-before-lunch problems, then skip BSG, is not for you. 4. If you're afraid of seeing real human stories put into a SF shell, perhaps you should go back to Star Trek (and I'm a trekkie too, but...) 5. If you crave to hear 'shields up' or 'engage' or other classic one- liners, then you should rather settle for "frak". Or is it "frakk"? 6. If you're unable to follow a 4 season-long story arc with every episode adding something precious to it without having withdrawal symptoms, then you should really don't give it a try. 7. If all that you want is see people in tight suits flashing laser pistols and teleporting from harms' way, then change the channel. 8. If your interest for spiritual quests, tough sexy girls and people really dying and not returning is something like zero. Oh well, you might skip that 'dying and not returning part' :P 9. If you don't like space battles rendered so real (and with as most care for real physics as a TV SF show can take) that you feel you ARE there. 10. Finally, if you have a mind so closed that you cannot appreciate what the best SF show ever made is all about. \n\nIn my opinion, any problem that somebody would have with this show would be his/her problem, not the shows. For the rest of us, BSG raised the bar so high, we almost cannot enjoy other SF shows anymore.\n\nBut then... we can always re-watch it, and hope others will learn from it, too.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158451,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-01-14","keywords":"human in outer space,nuclear weapon,totalitarianism,prophecy,space opera","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001579/","name":"Edward James Olmos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001521/","name":"Mary McDonnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0051397/","name":"Jamie Bamber"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103727/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176813/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129175/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488991/","name":"Glen A.

If you want mindless techno-babble, then this show isn't for you. 2. If you don't manage to appreciate what good... no, let me rephrase that for you: exquisite acting is, then you definitely shouldn't watch it. 3. If you expect to have a crew of four, including a science doctor, an alien, a military and some random Indiana Jones guy, all of them solving new let's-save-the-Earth-before-lunch problems, then skip BSG, is not for you. 4. If you're afraid of seeing real human stories put into a SF shell, perhaps you should go back to Star Trek (and I'm a trekkie too, but...) 5. If you crave to hear 'shields up' or 'engage' or other classic one- liners, then you should rather settle for "frak". Or is it "frakk"? 6. If you're unable to follow a 4 season-long story arc with every episode adding something precious to it without having withdrawal symptoms, then you should really don't give it a try. 7. If all that you want is see people in tight suits flashing laser pistols and teleporting from harms' way, then change the channel. 8. If your interest for spiritual quests, tough sexy girls and people really dying and not returning is something like zero. Oh well, you might skip that 'dying and not returning part' :P 9. If you don't like space battles rendered so real (and with as most care for real physics as a TV SF show can take) that you feel you ARE there. 10. Finally, if you have a mind so closed that you cannot appreciate what the best SF show ever made is all about. \n\nIn my opinion, any problem that somebody would have with this show would be his/her problem, not the shows. For the rest of us, BSG raised the bar so high, we almost cannot enjoy other SF shows anymore.\n\nBut then... we can always re-watch it, and hope others will learn from it, too.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158451,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-01-14","keywords":"human in outer space,nuclear weapon,totalitarianism,prophecy,space opera","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001579/","name":"Edward James Olmos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001521/","name":"Mary McDonnell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0051397/","name":"Jamie Bamber"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103727/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176813/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129175/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488991/","name":"Glen A.
