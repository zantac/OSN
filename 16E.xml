Very little is invested in the setting - most of the film is in an office. But it stands in contrast with how much is invested in the acting.\n\nAll the main actors are really salesmen - with their typical salesmen problems. And their annoying habits of bothering their victims as much as possible. As the story unfolds, characters evolve properly. Some don't.\n\nThe dialogues are intense, as it is written for plays. The mind tricks the salesmen are pulling are just amazing and may be compared to scenes of other great movies like The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nThe little substance of the plot - the sales team of a real estate office is put under pressure, as someone robbed it - is not annoying by the drama added. You can just feel Jack Lemon's tiredness of years and years of finding victims.\n\nOne thing was annoying: once you start to notice it's based on a play, you start to notice the limitations. Dialogues can be endless. There could have been more shots without dialogues. One knows that when one actor leaves the room, another is going to come in.\n\nBut it's still a very entertaining film for an interesting evening.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100741,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1992-10-02","keywords":"dialogue driven,office,rain,all male cast,calling someone a cunt","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Glengarry Glen Ross: 10 Year Anniversary 2-Disc Edition","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1890189593","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwZDM5YTYtM2M0NS00MmQwLWI2YjYtMDE2YjgzMjdlMDE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwZDM5YTYtM2M0NS00MmQwLWI2YjYtMDE2YjgzMjdlMDE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000493/","name":"Jack Lemmon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001226/","name":"James Foley"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034013/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019488/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000519/","name":"David Mamet"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Very little is invested in the setting - most of the film is in an office. But it stands in contrast with how much is invested in the acting.\n\nAll the main actors are really salesmen - with their typical salesmen problems. And their annoying habits of bothering their victims as much as possible. As the story unfolds, characters evolve properly. Some don't.\n\nThe dialogues are intense, as it is written for plays. The mind tricks the salesmen are pulling are just amazing and may be compared to scenes of other great movies like The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nThe little substance of the plot - the sales team of a real estate office is put under pressure, as someone robbed it - is not annoying by the drama added. You can just feel Jack Lemon's tiredness of years and years of finding victims.\n\nOne thing was annoying: once you start to notice it's based on a play, you start to notice the limitations. Dialogues can be endless. There could have been more shots without dialogues. One knows that when one actor leaves the room, another is going to come in.\n\nBut it's still a very entertaining film for an interesting evening.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100741,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1992-10-02","keywords":"dialogue driven,office,rain,all male cast,calling someone a cunt","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Glengarry Glen Ross: 10 Year Anniversary 2-Disc Edition","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1890189593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwZDM5YTYtM2M0NS00MmQwLWI2YjYtMDE2YjgzMjdlMDE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwZDM5YTYtM2M0NS00MmQwLWI2YjYtMDE2YjgzMjdlMDE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000493/","name":"Jack Lemmon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001226/","name":"James Foley"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034013/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019488/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000519/","name":"David Mamet"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Neve Campbell, Denise Richards (surprisingly), and especially Matt Dillion turn in very good performances. I always enjoy Bill Murray and his part in this movie, although fairly small, adds some levity.\n\nI can't comment too much on this movie without spoiling it, except to say that things aren't always what they expect to be.

I've seen the film several times and can't figure out what went wrong. Even Adam Sandler as Nicky, in one of the worst portrayals in screen history, isn't the reason this doesn't work. There is something else, some other reason.\n\nStill its worth seeing if you like okay comedies. It never scales the heights its ideas and bits say it should be reaching. If its on try it and see if its for you, you certainly could do worse.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":101676,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2000-11-10","keywords":"hell,devil,angel,fish out of water,satanist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Little Nicky","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1687355673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg3NDJlZDAtNjgyMS00Njg1LThmMWUtMDg5MDcwOTkzNTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg3NDJlZDAtNjgyMS00Njg1LThmMWUtMDg5MDcwOTkzNTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from New Line Cinema","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000099/","name":"Patricia Arquette","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000172/","name":"Harvey Keitel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0109359/","name":"Steven Brill"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028247/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379056/","name":"Tim Herlihy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0109359/","name":"Steven Brill"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Especially as an 80's baby/90's kid who grew up in a pop- culture environment where the psychotic hockey-masked killer Jason was known and loved by pretty much everyone... even kids like me who didn't see the films until we were older and only vaguely knew what they were about thanks to the whisperings and hints of our older siblings who were actually allowed to see the movies. (Usually renting them 2 or 3 at a time on trusty old VHS from the local Video King to watch after we younger brothers and sisters went to bed.)\n\nAt the time this review is being posted, the franchise has been running strong for well over 35 years. Boasting 10 films in its original continuity, the fabulously entertaining (and dopey as heck) cross- over spin-off "Freddy VS Jason", a somewhat underrated reboot in 2009 and a planned new film due out sometime within the next year or two. \n\nBut even a franchise so huge has to start with a small, humble beginning. Before the fame. Before the recognition. Before the birth of the pop-culture idol that the series spawned.\n\nYes, it all started with a teeny-tiny production back in 1980- the original "Friday the 13th."\n\nIt's almost impossible to really discuss this film critically without delving into spoiler territory (which I try to avoid in my reviews), though I will try my hardest to do so.\n\nThe film revolves around a group of young Camp Counselors who are prepping the infamous Camp Crystal Lake for a reopening about 20 years after a mysterious double-murder and a tragic drowning involving a young child. However, it appears someone isn't exactly a happy camper and doesn't want Crystal Lake back in business, and this mysterious figure begins to pick off our protagonists one-by- one until a tense climax reveals the dreaded truth...\n\nIt's no surprise at all that the film is essentially a glorified rip-off of the iconic slasher-horror that is John Carpenter's "Halloween." Director/Producer Sean S. Cunningham has been pretty candid about essentially wanting to create his own "roller-coaster" version of the Carpenter Classic with this film. Heck, they had ads and posters in the paper before the script was even written.\n\nBut the problem I really have with the film is that it all feels so routine. Even often boring and sometimes toothless. While it may not be fair to judge it by modern standards, even for its time, it just doesn't have that much going for it. (Especially as the very same year of release, such classics as "The Shining" and the underrated "The Changeling" were chilling audiences to the bone.) It's a very aimless, meandering film, with sloppy plotting and far too much focus placed on seemingly-pointless sequences for it to attain the "roller-coast" feeling the director was going for. The first half of the film is just too much a chore to slog through. And once the horror finally kicks in, it's just the same rinse-and-repeat formula scene-after-scene, with really only a few gruesome deaths here and there to pique audience interest. All those old clichés and tropes that even at the time had become slightly predictable.\n\nNow, I know what you're saying- those are the things people love about these flicks. The clichés and the gore-galore. But it's so slowly paced and messy in this movie, it's hard to really get into it. It really isn't until the plethora of sequels that the formula is established and the pacing is tightened enough for those clichés and tropes to finally become fun and entertaining.\n\nAs it stands, "Friday the 13th" does have its place in horror royalty. But I firmly believe it's more for spawning the long- running franchise that followed and less for the quality of the film itself.\n\nOh, and I guess it's also kinda famous for introducing some guy named Kevin Bacon as a supporting character... but I'm not sure if he actually went anywhere after this. \n\n(Please appreciate the obvious sarcasm there. I loves the Bacon!)\n\n"Friday the 13th" gets a middle-of-the-road 5 out of 10 from me. It's worth seeing because of its important part in the history of the overall franchise. But it's one of the weaker entries and lacks the style and entertainment seen in later films.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":127692,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1980-05-09","keywords":"nipples visible through clothing,murder,summer,bare breasts,female rear nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bloody Beginnings of the Summer Camp Slasher","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3229400601","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWViNDQ1NjAtNzM2Ny00MGQ4LWE3OTEtMDFiNDYwMWIzNWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWViNDQ1NjAtNzM2Ny00MGQ4LWE3OTEtMDFiNDYwMWIzNWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Through 13 Watchlist picks, we resurrect the bloody roots of the prototypical summer camp slasher: 'Friday the 13th' (1980)."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0658133/","name":"Betsy Palmer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454415/","name":"Adrienne King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852551/","name":"Jeannine Taylor"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192446/","name":"Sean S.

Especially as an 80's baby/90's kid who grew up in a pop- culture environment where the psychotic hockey-masked killer Jason was known and loved by pretty much everyone... even kids like me who didn't see the films until we were older and only vaguely knew what they were about thanks to the whisperings and hints of our older siblings who were actually allowed to see the movies. (Usually renting them 2 or 3 at a time on trusty old VHS from the local Video King to watch after we younger brothers and sisters went to bed.)\n\nAt the time this review is being posted, the franchise has been running strong for well over 35 years. Boasting 10 films in its original continuity, the fabulously entertaining (and dopey as heck) cross- over spin-off "Freddy VS Jason", a somewhat underrated reboot in 2009 and a planned new film due out sometime within the next year or two. \n\nBut even a franchise so huge has to start with a small, humble beginning. Before the fame. Before the recognition. Before the birth of the pop-culture idol that the series spawned.\n\nYes, it all started with a teeny-tiny production back in 1980- the original "Friday the 13th."\n\nIt's almost impossible to really discuss this film critically without delving into spoiler territory (which I try to avoid in my reviews), though I will try my hardest to do so.\n\nThe film revolves around a group of young Camp Counselors who are prepping the infamous Camp Crystal Lake for a reopening about 20 years after a mysterious double-murder and a tragic drowning involving a young child. However, it appears someone isn't exactly a happy camper and doesn't want Crystal Lake back in business, and this mysterious figure begins to pick off our protagonists one-by- one until a tense climax reveals the dreaded truth...\n\nIt's no surprise at all that the film is essentially a glorified rip-off of the iconic slasher-horror that is John Carpenter's "Halloween." Director/Producer Sean S. Cunningham has been pretty candid about essentially wanting to create his own "roller-coaster" version of the Carpenter Classic with this film. Heck, they had ads and posters in the paper before the script was even written.\n\nBut the problem I really have with the film is that it all feels so routine. Even often boring and sometimes toothless. While it may not be fair to judge it by modern standards, even for its time, it just doesn't have that much going for it. (Especially as the very same year of release, such classics as "The Shining" and the underrated "The Changeling" were chilling audiences to the bone.) It's a very aimless, meandering film, with sloppy plotting and far too much focus placed on seemingly-pointless sequences for it to attain the "roller-coast" feeling the director was going for. The first half of the film is just too much a chore to slog through. And once the horror finally kicks in, it's just the same rinse-and-repeat formula scene-after-scene, with really only a few gruesome deaths here and there to pique audience interest. All those old clichés and tropes that even at the time had become slightly predictable.\n\nNow, I know what you're saying- those are the things people love about these flicks. The clichés and the gore-galore. But it's so slowly paced and messy in this movie, it's hard to really get into it. It really isn't until the plethora of sequels that the formula is established and the pacing is tightened enough for those clichés and tropes to finally become fun and entertaining.\n\nAs it stands, "Friday the 13th" does have its place in horror royalty. But I firmly believe it's more for spawning the long- running franchise that followed and less for the quality of the film itself.\n\nOh, and I guess it's also kinda famous for introducing some guy named Kevin Bacon as a supporting character... but I'm not sure if he actually went anywhere after this. \n\n(Please appreciate the obvious sarcasm there. I loves the Bacon!)\n\n"Friday the 13th" gets a middle-of-the-road 5 out of 10 from me. It's worth seeing because of its important part in the history of the overall franchise. But it's one of the weaker entries and lacks the style and entertainment seen in later films.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":127692,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1980-05-09","keywords":"nipples visible through clothing,murder,summer,bare breasts,female rear nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bloody Beginnings of the Summer Camp Slasher","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3229400601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWViNDQ1NjAtNzM2Ny00MGQ4LWE3OTEtMDFiNDYwMWIzNWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWViNDQ1NjAtNzM2Ny00MGQ4LWE3OTEtMDFiNDYwMWIzNWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Through 13 Watchlist picks, we resurrect the bloody roots of the prototypical summer camp slasher: 'Friday the 13th' (1980).","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0658133/","name":"Betsy Palmer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454415/","name":"Adrienne King","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852551/","name":"Jeannine Taylor"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192446/","name":"Sean S.

    <title lang="hr">Profileri</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Francuska serija pod nazivom "Profileri" predstavlja Chloé, kriminalističku psihologinju koja istražuje ubojice kako bi pomogla riješiti slučajeve zločina. Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

Perhaps the best film of 2007, maybe one of the best from the past few years, if you see this movie you will NOT regret it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":76540,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Animation","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2006-11-25","keywords":"lucid dream,virtual reality,dream,police,butterfly collection","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Paprika","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3734962457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3ZWM4ZjAtNzhlZS00NzVlLThjOTctZDA4MzBjMWJiMmIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3ZWM4ZjAtNzhlZS00NzVlLThjOTctZDA4MzBjMWJiMmIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Sony Pictures Classics","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370677/","name":"Megumi Hayashibara","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256609/","name":"Tôru Emori","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0394653/","name":"Katsunosuke Hori"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464804/","name":"Satoshi Kon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022946/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052145/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0875489/","name":"Yasutaka Tsutsui","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2008007/","name":"Seishi Minakami","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464804/","name":"Satoshi Kon"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Policajci je traže nakon što je nisu vidjeli trinaest sati. Otkriveno je da je Caleb Wright, s kojim je bila na spoju, zapravo štićenik serijske ubojice Rosalind Dyer. Dok svi traže Chen, Caleb otima Armstronga i odvodi ga u kuću koja je pripadala Rosalindinom ujaku. U međuvremenu, Angela i Wesley raspravljaju o Wesleyevom mentalnom zdravlju nakon što je on popio tablete s alkoholom. Rosalind otkriva Nolanu da ima još jednu tajnu, a ona je vezana za Armstronga.</desc>

Novaci i njihovi časnici za obuku prolaze kroz "follow-up" dan, kada im se dodjeljuju neaktivni slučajevi. Nolan i Harper istražuju pljačku lutrijskih listića i smrt supruge vlasnika trgovine. Trag ih vodi do striptiz-kluba, gdje plesačica sa šipke, Chastity, na snimkama videonadzora prepoznaje osumnjičenika kojeg traže, Tuckera Novaka. Novak ih zatim upućuje na Colta Henryja.</desc>

Novaci i njihovi časnici za obuku prolaze kroz "follow-up" dan, kada im se dodjeljuju neaktivni slučajevi. Nolan i Harper istražuju pljačku lutrijskih listića i smrt supruge vlasnika trgovine. Trag ih vodi do striptiz-kluba, gdje plesačica sa šipke, Chastity, na snimkama videonadzora prepoznaje osumnjičenika kojeg traže, Tuckera Novaka. Novak ih zatim upućuje na Colta Henryja.</desc>

Roger Donaldson also directed The Bank Job (2008) which is one of Jason Statham' best movie. Let me tell you how excited I was when I heard that Pierce Brosnan was returning as a spy; A little bit nostalgic. This film is full of classic spy cliché such as, for instance, people walking away slow motion explosions and it doesn't seem to get started until half way through. However towards the third act the movie really showed itself and I was like: "Why didn't they do that from the beginning?" Unfortunately, the fact is that it's so terribly cliché since the beginning that when you see where things are going and certain puzzle pieces start to make sense, you are already checked out of the movie. Yet, Pierce Brosnan is great; he could play this role eyes closed. Olga Kurylenko is good as well, you grow some sympathy for her character and the movie takes on a completely different meaning when you realised certain things about her. Plus, I have to point out that women are over objectify and her character is only introduced when it's convenient for the man to have a bargaining girl which isn't as cool as it sounds. Brosnan's protegee starring Luke Bracey is pretty cool as well and I think this guy's got a future. This movie reminds me of two other movies released this years: 3 Days to Kill and Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. \n\nOverall I think The November Man could have been a lot better thanks to a stronger writing and directing; it's good to see Pierce Brosnan back into the spy game.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65687,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-08-27","keywords":"stripper,premarital sex,sex standing up,sex scene,belgrade serbia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3721243673","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An ex-CIA operative is brought back in on a very personal mission and finds himself pitted against his former pupil in a deadly game involving high level CIA officials and the Russian president-elect.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3478396/","name":"Luke Bracey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1385871/","name":"Olga Kurylenko"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002044/","name":"Roger Donaldson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088199/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0500612/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3360218/","name":"Michael Finch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2244980/","name":"Karl Gajdusek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1952653/","name":"Bill Granger"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As an aspiring author myself, this film was so inspiring for me in terms of writing, it's really made me want to get out there and achieve my goals and not end up in a terrible life that I don't like. This film, although with the unrealistic storyline, was still so realistic on so many levels and I think this will remain a lifelong favourite of mine. Chris is so talented on so many levels.\n\nI cannot wait for this to be released on DVD in this country so I can keep it forever.\n\nAs a big fan of his television show, Glee, I immediately fell in love with Chris and his character there. I also, as well as Kurt Hummel, identify myself with Carson so much. I am so glad that I saw this film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14719,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-01-11","keywords":"narration from the grave,chin up,blackmail,high school,reference to betty ford","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3931743257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM1ODI4NjI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTk4NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM1ODI4NjI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTk4NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After being struck and killed by lightning, a young man recounts the way he blackmailed his fellow classmates into contributing to his literary magazine.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3182094/","name":"Chris Colfer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2313103/","name":"Rebel Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0376716/","name":"Christina Hendricks"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200380/","name":"Brian Dannelly"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011800/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346585/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0343782/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3182094/","name":"Chris Colfer"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Well this is it. The movie is non-stop action after the first fifteen minutes of character development is finished. Having experienced what it is like to be over-run by the NVA during the third week of my first VN tour I can tell you that this movie does an excellent job of showing the excitement, tension, exhaustion, chaos, and courage of an extended battle. While this is by no means the best war movie I have ever seen, it is the first Viet Nam war movie which has provided me with a sense of satisfaction after leaving the theater. Mel Gibson turns in a good performance, Sam Elliot is a bit stiff. The wives of the soldiers are believable. Including a bit of the NVA's attitude about the war adds a balanced flavor to the film. Overall I would say that you will experience at least a small part the intensity of war if you go to this movie. I took my female companion and she was shocked, touched, and thrilled with it.

Well this is it. The movie is non-stop action after the first fifteen minutes of character development is finished. Having experienced what it is like to be over-run by the NVA during the third week of my first VN tour I can tell you that this movie does an excellent job of showing the excitement, tension, exhaustion, chaos, and courage of an extended battle. While this is by no means the best war movie I have ever seen, it is the first Viet Nam war movie which has provided me with a sense of satisfaction after leaving the theater. Mel Gibson turns in a good performance, Sam Elliot is a bit stiff. The wives of the soldiers are believable. Including a bit of the NVA's attitude about the war adds a balanced flavor to the film. Overall I would say that you will experience at least a small part the intensity of war if you go to this movie. I took my female companion and she was shocked, touched, and thrilled with it. As Americans, we need to remember that freedom is not, and never has been, free. It is always paid for with the blood of those who fight to get it, sustain it, or expand it. The politically correct may not like this film, but then who cares what they like. Thanks for making this film Mel.

Small budget? Unknown actors that do not manage to deliver properly? Or maybe the script &amp; execution are just not of any standards at all.\n\nTake for example Lights Out, Get Out, REC and other such other productions that clearly show that if someone capable is behind the camera the result will be satisfactory. So where did Polaroid fail exactly?\n\nWell I appreciated the fact that it did not drag on for too long with its premise, thus it developed quite nicely and put us fast right in the middle of the action, sooner that expected.

So where did Polaroid fail exactly?\n\nWell I appreciated the fact that it did not drag on for too long with its premise, thus it developed quite nicely and put us fast right in the middle of the action, sooner that expected. But after this, the kills were of no impact whatsoever, the explanation came with the most common answer you find in horror and the final act seemed....under cooked.

Nor that it plays just once per day, at 9pm, at my local Cineworld compared to five screenings per day for Captain Phillips, eight for Ender's Game and fourteen for Thor: The Dark World.\n\nBut Bill Condon's (Gods and Monsters, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn) film about Wikileaks founder and hero/pariah (delete according to your political stance) Julian Assange really isn't that bad. Take that as you will.\n\nNot really a biopic, The Fifth Estate takes a similar approach to Assange as The Social Network did with Mark Zuckerberg, looking more at the product of the man than the man himself. It consumes 8 minutes more of your time than The Social Network, feels twice as long, is far more arduous and will require just a single viewing, compared to repeat visits for the Facebook flick.\n\nTrudging through the meeting of the ultimate whistleblower Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Daniel Berg (Daniel Brühl), the explosion of Wikileaks in the public's perception, the shadowy deals with The Guardian and the fall out from countless exposés about underhand dealings from governments and corporations, The Fifth Estate spews out a huge amount of information but never quite manages to get down to the gritty truth.\n\nIt feels cluttered and more of a lecture than a movie and I'm not sure I know a great deal more about Assange now than I did yesterday. Too much has been shoehorned into its 128 minute running time but it still only glances over some of the highest profile matters surrounding Assange: the Bradley/Chelsea Manning revelations and the sexual misconduct allegation against Assange that have led to his exile in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\n\nCumberbatch succeeds admirably in portraying Assange as an obsessive with a serious case of egotism and a lack of social graces or personal care. It's a fine performance and will be a revelation to those who know Cumberbatch only from BBC's Sherlock or Star Trek Into Darkness. He is eminently watchable and succeeds in making an unpleasant man fascinating to watch. Assange wrote an open letter to Cumberbatch hoping to dissuade him from portraying him on film in The Fifth Estate, a "wretched" film, a work of fiction "based on a deceitful book", and one imagines that, should a copy of the film reach him inside his 'prison' he'll be dismayed by the way he is portrayed. Perhaps he'll be magnanimous to concede that, nevertheless, it is a fine performance from Cumberbatch.\n\nMany of the other prominent actors don't fare quite as well. Brühl follows up his superb performance in Rush with a more downbeat character that he never really sinks his teeth into. Like Brühl, Alicia Vikander, Berg's love interest and just one of many thorns in Assange's side, has little to play with and her performance is smothered by the presence of Assange.\n\nBucking the trend, David Thewlis gives a pastiche of a Guardian journalist, more given to flouncing noisily into meetings and huffing in exasperation than acting. But Thewlis' performance is evened out by able turns from the new Doctor Who, Peter Capaldi, Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci, though with so many characters vying for screen time and Condon battling to squeeze in as much information as possible alongside some outdated 80s techniques (text across faces, anyone?), they, too are lost in the mêlée.\n\nThe Fifth Estate isn't a great film and it may not be terribly truthful (the jury's still out on that one) but, despite it's flaws, I still enjoyed it. Once! And maybe truthful representations aren't important. As Cumberbatch wrote in his response to Assange, " the film should provoke debate and not consensus." \n\nAnd in that, at least, The Fifth Estate succeeds admirably.\n\nFor more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39996,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-10-18","keywords":"internet,wikileaks,computer hacker,whistleblowing,news leak","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2566236441","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMDI2OTEyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY3OTc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMDI2OTEyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY3OTc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A dramatic thriller based on real events that reveals the quest to expose the deceptions and corruptions of power that turned an Internet upstart into the 21st centuryÂ’s most fiercely debated organization.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212722/","name":"Benedict Cumberbatch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0117709/","name":"Daniel Brühl"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0396924/","name":"Carice van Houten"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4089358/","name":"Daniel Domscheit-Berg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3859582/","name":"David Leigh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4816469/","name":"Luke Harding"}],"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Nor that it plays just once per day, at 9pm, at my local Cineworld compared to five screenings per day for Captain Phillips, eight for Ender's Game and fourteen for Thor: The Dark World.\n\nBut Bill Condon's (Gods and Monsters, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn) film about Wikileaks founder and hero/pariah (delete according to your political stance) Julian Assange really isn't that bad. Take that as you will.\n\nNot really a biopic, The Fifth Estate takes a similar approach to Assange as The Social Network did with Mark Zuckerberg, looking more at the product of the man than the man himself. It consumes 8 minutes more of your time than The Social Network, feels twice as long, is far more arduous and will require just a single viewing, compared to repeat visits for the Facebook flick.\n\nTrudging through the meeting of the ultimate whistleblower Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Daniel Berg (Daniel Brühl), the explosion of Wikileaks in the public's perception, the shadowy deals with The Guardian and the fall out from countless exposés about underhand dealings from governments and corporations, The Fifth Estate spews out a huge amount of information but never quite manages to get down to the gritty truth.\n\nIt feels cluttered and more of a lecture than a movie and I'm not sure I know a great deal more about Assange now than I did yesterday. Too much has been shoehorned into its 128 minute running time but it still only glances over some of the highest profile matters surrounding Assange: the Bradley/Chelsea Manning revelations and the sexual misconduct allegation against Assange that have led to his exile in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\n\nCumberbatch succeeds admirably in portraying Assange as an obsessive with a serious case of egotism and a lack of social graces or personal care. It's a fine performance and will be a revelation to those who know Cumberbatch only from BBC's Sherlock or Star Trek Into Darkness. He is eminently watchable and succeeds in making an unpleasant man fascinating to watch. Assange wrote an open letter to Cumberbatch hoping to dissuade him from portraying him on film in The Fifth Estate, a "wretched" film, a work of fiction "based on a deceitful book", and one imagines that, should a copy of the film reach him inside his 'prison' he'll be dismayed by the way he is portrayed. Perhaps he'll be magnanimous to concede that, nevertheless, it is a fine performance from Cumberbatch.\n\nMany of the other prominent actors don't fare quite as well. Brühl follows up his superb performance in Rush with a more downbeat character that he never really sinks his teeth into. Like Brühl, Alicia Vikander, Berg's love interest and just one of many thorns in Assange's side, has little to play with and her performance is smothered by the presence of Assange.\n\nBucking the trend, David Thewlis gives a pastiche of a Guardian journalist, more given to flouncing noisily into meetings and huffing in exasperation than acting. But Thewlis' performance is evened out by able turns from the new Doctor Who, Peter Capaldi, Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci, though with so many characters vying for screen time and Condon battling to squeeze in as much information as possible alongside some outdated 80s techniques (text across faces, anyone?), they, too are lost in the mêlée.\n\nThe Fifth Estate isn't a great film and it may not be terribly truthful (the jury's still out on that one) but, despite it's flaws, I still enjoyed it. Once! And maybe truthful representations aren't important. As Cumberbatch wrote in his response to Assange, " the film should provoke debate and not consensus." \n\nAnd in that, at least, The Fifth Estate succeeds admirably.\n\nFor more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39996,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-10-18","keywords":"internet,wikileaks,computer hacker,whistleblowing,news leak","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2566236441","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMDI2OTEyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY3OTc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMDI2OTEyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY3OTc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A dramatic thriller based on real events that reveals the quest to expose the deceptions and corruptions of power that turned an Internet upstart into the 21st centuryÂ’s most fiercely debated organization.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212722/","name":"Benedict Cumberbatch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0117709/","name":"Daniel Brühl","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0396924/","name":"Carice van Houten"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174374/","name":"Bill Condon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4089358/","name":"Daniel Domscheit-Berg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3859582/","name":"David Leigh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4816469/","name":"Luke Harding"],"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Mud is a genuine piece of filmmaking, which is not only thoughtful, but engrossing until the very end. It's deliberate slow pace ends up serving this film well, giving us time to soak it all in.

McConaughey pulls it off with conviction, and I felt he was tremendous. The best performance might just be Tye Sherdian as Ellis. For an actor his age, he was absolutely incredible, displaying many ranges of emotion throughout the film. This kid is going special places in my opinion, and I'll be shocked if he doesn't. Jacob Lofland is great as Neckbone (Ellis's best friend) Reese Witherspoon doesn't have a ton of screen time as you may think, but her character Juniper plays a pivotal part. Reese nails the part, and is gorgeous to boot. Sam Shepard adds great support as a longtime friend to Mud, as the grumpy assassin. \n\nFinal Thoughts: Its films like this, that restore my faith in Hollywood.

It's one of my favorite films of 2013","reviewBody":"Two curious young boys encounter a fugitive (Matthew McConaughey) named Mud where they live. They willingly do deeds for him, and try to reunite him with his love Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) The problem is, a bunch of bounty hunters are after Mud. \n\nIt's always nice to see such a tremendous film of this nature, after all the garbage Hollywood tends to churn out these days. Mud is a genuine piece of filmmaking, which is not only thoughtful, but engrossing until the very end. It's deliberate slow pace ends up serving this film well, giving us time to soak it all in. I also loved the southern setting in this film, which made it all the more genuine, and realistic. The cinematography is a sight to behold, with many beautiful sights that never failed to amaze me. Mud is a very likable fugitive, and quite sympathetic in my opinion, and I give all the credit to McConaughey for that. He still has that charismatic swagger he always does, but he delves a lot deeper for this role. His good looks, give way to a dirty, greasy fugitive, who will do anything to survive, but is not void of morality. He cares about the young boys, even if it is for his own reasons. McConaughey pulls it off with conviction, and I felt he was tremendous. The best performance might just be Tye Sherdian as Ellis. For an actor his age, he was absolutely incredible, displaying many ranges of emotion throughout the film. This kid is going special places in my opinion, and I'll be shocked if he doesn't. Jacob Lofland is great as Neckbone (Ellis's best friend) Reese Witherspoon doesn't have a ton of screen time as you may think, but her character Juniper plays a pivotal part. Reese nails the part, and is gorgeous to boot. Sam Shepard adds great support as a longtime friend to Mud, as the grumpy assassin. \n\nFinal Thoughts: Its films like this, that restore my faith in Hollywood. It's genuine, gritty, and downright absorbing. I loved this film, and I can't possibly see why anyone would dislike it. It's just a great film\n\n9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":173952,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-05-10","keywords":"southern gothic,river,friendship between boys,character name as title,lionsgate","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1899734553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMTY1MTYxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI3OTQ0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMTY1MTYxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI3OTQ0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Two teenage boys encounter a fugitive and form a pact to help him evade the bounty hunters on his trail and to reunite him with his true love.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000190/","name":"Matthew McConaughey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4446467/","name":"Tye Sheridan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5015107/","name":"Jacob Lofland"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2158772/","name":"Jeff Nichols"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064141/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0360267/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2158772/","name":"Jeff Nichols"],"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is an important thing to say because Inside Llewyn Davis is certainly not a film to come to as a casual viewer just looking to kill a few hours – not as a snobby thing of "you'll not appreciate it" but just a reality that the film does almost nothing to help the viewer. The plot involves struggling folk musician Llewyn Davis in the Greenwich Village scene of the early 1960s; he is not particularly commercial, is irresponsible, downbeat and cannot look after others or even the cat belonging to others. We follow him over the course of a week which will change his life and see the world around him change too.\n\nI really did want to like this film because at times there is a certain beauty to it in the pained reality of its lead character, his situation and his gradual realization of where his life is and where it is going. Unfortunately this is generally spread very thin and instead of having a structure that supports this, we instead get an episodic approach that makes the "week" feel like months, sees characters just come and go whether we have an interest in them or not and generally doesn't allow you to do more than grasp at metaphors which drift by – usually resulting in the people who love the film the most being those who brought a lot of their own selves to the table, leaving us who look to the film to at least help, feeling left out in the cold and even a little bored.\n\nThe music is beautiful when it comes and the cinematography is excellent as it captures and shapes the feel of the film and the character – it is bleak to look at for sure, but it is suitable and effective for what the film is. The same could be said of Isaac's performance because it is what the film needs him to do but the downside is that it isn't really what the viewer needs him to do. His personal journey (physical and emotional) is made harder b the coldness of his character – there is really not much to grab hold of here and he is generally difficult. As often is the case with the Coens, we have characters drifting though the story usually in a colorful fashion – the times it has worked in other films has been frequent but here I didn't think it did at all, with nobody seeming to add much. As writers of the material and directors of their cast the "blame" (depending on your view) belongs with the Coens as they have made this film very difficult to get into.\n\nFull of supposed metaphors and with a sadness which is put in the distance look of its title character rather than in his heart or in the audience's line of sight, the film drifts along with a general sense of sadness and change which always interested me but just seemed deliberately out of reach and distant.

It has an interesting concept, an app that can tell you when you'll die with unbelievable accuracy. That's fun, right? Unfortunately the concept, and the movie as a whole tends to fall apart if you look at it too hard.\n\nTo its credit, I'm not sure how hard it's really trying. It at times seems to take itself seriously and then at other points not at all. The performances are all... There. Nothing really great to report. Oh, and there's a lesson about sexual harassment as well.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a blah horror flick. Not terribly memorable beyond the concept and, honestly, not worth spending the money to see it on the big screen.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":30701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-10-25","keywords":"violence,race against time,sexual harassment at work,boss sexually harassing employee,sexually harassed by one's boss","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2813181721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjA1NWIxMGYtYzdhMC00Yjg3LWE1Y2MtNDAxYTE0YmM3ZGQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjA1NWIxMGYtYzdhMC00Yjg3LWE1Y2MtNDAxYTE0YmM3ZGQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When a young nurse downloads an app that claims to predict exactly \nwhen a person is going to die, it tells her she only has three days to live.

Napeta ratna drama... Oscarom nagrađeni redatelj Sam Mendes, poznat po velikim hitovima poput Vrtloga života, Skyfall i Spectre, predstavlja spektakl o Prvom svjetskom ratu jednostavnog naziva 1917. Napeta ratna drama prati dva mlada britanska vojnika, koji dobivaju naizgled nemoguću misiju. U utrci protiv vremena moraju prijeći neprijateljski teritorij i dostaviti poruku koja će zaustaviti ubojiti napad na stotine vojnika, koji nemaju pojma da se napad sprema, a među njima je i brat jednog od dvojice vojnika. Oscarovac Mendes u filmu prikazuje zaista fantastične, ali i zastrašujuće ratne scene nismo do sada imali prilike vidjeti na velikom platnu.</desc>

Although Gibney has a definite viewpoint, he gives both sides of the question a hearing.\n\nAlthough I had previously watched news coverage dealing with Stuxnet, this documentary goes far more in depth, making good use of inside sources within the NSA. In particular, Gibney examines the split that emerged between the United States and Israel over the use of the virus, ultimately culminating in a near disaster. The film provides a disturbing warning of how the American and Israeli governments have potentially opened a Pandora's box.\n\nThis film is important viewing that should be seen by everyone interested in current events or concerned over the implications of American foreign policy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9389,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2016-07-08","keywords":"iran,cyber attack,computer worm,hacking,stuxnet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3677533209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTg2MDExMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI5ODY5ODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTg2MDExMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI5ODY5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"a documentary thriller about the world of cyberwar.

It's a five-star three star movie that embraces the fun rubber-suit splatter gore aesthetics of cheesy 80s flicks, the kind that Troma excelled at (but without the vomit and nudity that often went along with it - the main characters are middle-school students after all). The monsters in the film feel like someone decided to do a comic version of Warhammer 40K - strange, horrifying, with gothic elements that incorporate weird baby faces, disturbing technology, magic and machinery. Now put all that firepower in the hands of a truly psychotic middle-schooler, and make it a comedy. It's good, dumb fun that embraces its concept to an almost ludicrous degree.

It's a five-star three star movie that embraces the fun rubber-suit splatter gore aesthetics of cheesy 80s flicks, the kind that Troma excelled at (but without the vomit and nudity that often went along with it - the main characters are middle-school students after all). The monsters in the film feel like someone decided to do a comic version of Warhammer 40K - strange, horrifying, with gothic elements that incorporate weird baby faces, disturbing technology, magic and machinery. Now put all that firepower in the hands of a truly psychotic middle-schooler, and make it a comedy. It's good, dumb fun that embraces its concept to an almost ludicrous degree.

Inwardly, the film is about the unspoken but palpable feelings between two people of very different stature and station which may or may not be forever cast in the crazed pigments of the masterpiece. Those who can tap into the subtle human emotional undercurrents will find this film far more satisfying than those who cannot. Regardless, all will find "Girl with a Pearl Earring" a masterpiece of filmmaking.

But the Cumbrians are going without their erstwhile lieutenant, Harry Feversham, who has resigned his commission to avoid combat in the Sudan.  His three closest friends in the regiment, understandably outraged at Harry for leaving them in the lurch, each mail him a white feather, a traditional accusation of cowardice.  His fiancee gives him a fourth feather.  In despair, Harry sets off to the Sudan, hoping to rejoin his friends and prove to them that he is no coward.\n\nThe first half of the movie is unbearably slow, and exasperating too.  The characters don't behave like Victorians, but like high school students from the 20th  century who are ignorant of the values of the society around them. Harry's fiancee openly flirts with him unchaperoned and kisses him in public.  Harry, like a refugee from our own non-judgmental era, seems amazed that his cowardice is met by rebukes from everyone around him.  And his initial act *is* cowardly, no matter how hard the movie may pretend that it isn't.  Harry doesn't refuse to fight because he thinks the war is wrong, or because he has conflicting obligations to meet; he admits that he would not fight for anything at all.  One could hardly offer a better one-sentence definition of a coward.\n\nThe fact that Harry's initial actions really are cowardly is important: it means that his adventure to the Sudan is not an effort at vindication, but at atonement.  And while he does prove that he can behave bravely, he is far more successful at proving that he is a hopeless bungler.  For most of the latter half of the movie, Harry just follows his friend Abou around, and everything Harry attempts by himself comes to grief from which he is rescued by Abou, usually while Harry puts Abou's own life in serious danger.  This does not satisfy the viewers' thirst to see Harry atone for his earlier cowardice.  Just showing that he can be brave is not enough; he can atone only by undoing the harm he caused by his earlier decision to let his friends face danger without him, and because of his incompetence it is not he who does that, but Abou.  It doesn't take long to start thinking, "Who cares about Harry?  I want to watch Abou!  He's the only guy in this movie who has the foggiest idea what he's about!"\n\nThe word on the street was that THE FOUR FEATHERS might be undone by politically correct posturing.  That is not true.  THE FOUR FEATHERS doesn't have a political bone in its body.  Nobody bothers to explain what the Mahdi is fighting about, or even to mention that the Sudan of the movie's era is an Egyptian colony, not a British one.  Nothing in the movie suggests what difference it makes to either the British or the Sudanese whether the Mahdists win or not.  To those who don't already have an opinion, it's anybody's guess who has the right of this quarrel.  At the end, the movie becomes expressly apolitical.  As Harry's heroic friend Jack declares, the British Tommies don't fight for a flag or an idea. "We fight for the man on our left."  Actually, the movie might have benefited from more political content.  For one thing, it could have clarified why Abou, one of an unidentifed "tribe of slaves," is willing to help the British, who extinguished the slave trade throughout their empire in the 19th century.\n\nAs for the production values, Shekhar Kapur should be reported to the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Cameras for his constant torture of the focus control.  He doesn't appear to understand that making everything blurry will not make him a better artist.  Heath Ledger's role as Harry chiefly calls for him to cry a lot, which he does creditably.  Djimon Hounsou is almost unrecognizable in his part as Abou, with a beard, a weird hairstyle, and a light coating of dust, but he has never been more charismatic; there's no doubt why the feckless Harry clings to this rock of self-confidence.  Wes Bentley as one of Harry's former friends cuts a dashing figure and later does a convincing impression of disability.  Kate Hudson struggles in a ludicrous role.\n\nThis movie fails on many levels, but it could have overcome any of those failures except one: the weak hero.  It's not enough to make the protagonist suffer constantly to make us sympathize with him.  He has to be worthy of something more than suffering in the first place.\n\nRating: *1/2 out of ****\n\nRecommendation: Even action fans should skip this one."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33476,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-04-23","keywords":"male nudity,nudity,whipping,sex,naked dead man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Four Feathers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2549219609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJhODg4Y2QtOTYyMS00YzczLTljNTgtMzdlMWVmZTM3MjU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJhODg4Y2QtOTYyMS00YzczLTljNTgtMzdlMWVmZTM3MjU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Miramax"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005132/","name":"Heath Ledger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004747/","name":"Wes Bentley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005028/","name":"Kate Hudson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001408/","name":"Shekhar Kapur"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029177/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0556571/","name":"A.E.W.

He seeks to sign over his plays and sonnets to Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto), but that's easier said than done. When William Shakespeare takes credit (Rafe Spall), that's the least of concerns as the words of Edward affect the political climate.\n\nRhys Ifans is an unrecognizable powerhouse, and though the rest of the cast fairs well, he shines. As does director Roland Emmerich, who uses every trick at his disposal to make a highly sophisticated drama littered with elaborate costumes and set decoration to be admired. \n\nThe theatre experience is very well represented in Anonymous, with the narrator barely making the curtain. Believe it or not but this does actually happen and there are actors who specialize in. The workings of the theatre coincide with the events described and eventually merge. In the time of Edward, the Globe is shown with spectacular accuracy and the familiar faces of the troupe appear across plays.\n\nThe future of England is put at stake as the insight into Edward's inspiration is penned on a relationship with Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave and in younger form Joely Richardson). These secrets showcase the power of words to win over love and country. \n\nIs it cheating to inject stolen verse into a screenplay? To some extent yes.

He seeks to sign over his plays and sonnets to Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto), but that's easier said than done. When William Shakespeare takes credit (Rafe Spall), that's the least of concerns as the words of Edward affect the political climate.\n\nRhys Ifans is an unrecognizable powerhouse, and though the rest of the cast fairs well, he shines. As does director Roland Emmerich, who uses every trick at his disposal to make a highly sophisticated drama littered with elaborate costumes and set decoration to be admired. \n\nThe theatre experience is very well represented in Anonymous, with the narrator barely making the curtain. Believe it or not but this does actually happen and there are actors who specialize in. The workings of the theatre coincide with the events described and eventually merge. In the time of Edward, the Globe is shown with spectacular accuracy and the familiar faces of the troupe appear across plays.\n\nThe future of England is put at stake as the insight into Edward's inspiration is penned on a relationship with Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave and in younger form Joely Richardson). These secrets showcase the power of words to win over love and country. \n\nIs it cheating to inject stolen verse into a screenplay? To some extent yes. We're talking about a movie that lifts words, then says they came from a thief. A bit of a paradox if anything. Similarly, it would be silly for J.J. Abrams to direct a movie that's filled with scenes from every Steven Spielberg film, yet that happened with Super 8.\n\nIf Anonymous has a fault, it would be in jerking around the audience.

A strong, uncompromising movie, gripping even if you know the ending before it starts.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":127074,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Biography","Crime"],"datePublished":"1979-06-22","keywords":"escape,prison,island,prison island,1960s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4045127193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E5NjhiNWYtNThmYy00ZTA1LTg4ZWMtMWQ3YzA3NWFiMjA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E5NjhiNWYtNThmYy00ZTA1LTg4ZWMtMWQ3YzA3NWFiMjA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001526/","name":"Patrick McGoohan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089348/","name":"Roberts Blossom"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0796923/","name":"Don Siegel"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102264/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115431/","name":"J.

But the Cumbrians are going without their erstwhile lieutenant, Harry Feversham, who has resigned his commission to avoid combat in the Sudan.  His three closest friends in the regiment, understandably outraged at Harry for leaving them in the lurch, each mail him a white feather, a traditional accusation of cowardice.  His fiancee gives him a fourth feather.  In despair, Harry sets off to the Sudan, hoping to rejoin his friends and prove to them that he is no coward.\n\nThe first half of the movie is unbearably slow, and exasperating too.  The characters don't behave like Victorians, but like high school students from the 20th  century who are ignorant of the values of the society around them. Harry's fiancee openly flirts with him unchaperoned and kisses him in public.  Harry, like a refugee from our own non-judgmental era, seems amazed that his cowardice is met by rebukes from everyone around him.  And his initial act *is* cowardly, no matter how hard the movie may pretend that it isn't.  Harry doesn't refuse to fight because he thinks the war is wrong, or because he has conflicting obligations to meet; he admits that he would not fight for anything at all.  One could hardly offer a better one-sentence definition of a coward.\n\nThe fact that Harry's initial actions really are cowardly is important: it means that his adventure to the Sudan is not an effort at vindication, but at atonement.  And while he does prove that he can behave bravely, he is far more successful at proving that he is a hopeless bungler.  For most of the latter half of the movie, Harry just follows his friend Abou around, and everything Harry attempts by himself comes to grief from which he is rescued by Abou, usually while Harry puts Abou's own life in serious danger.  This does not satisfy the viewers' thirst to see Harry atone for his earlier cowardice.  Just showing that he can be brave is not enough; he can atone only by undoing the harm he caused by his earlier decision to let his friends face danger without him, and because of his incompetence it is not he who does that, but Abou.  It doesn't take long to start thinking, "Who cares about Harry?  I want to watch Abou!  He's the only guy in this movie who has the foggiest idea what he's about!"\n\nThe word on the street was that THE FOUR FEATHERS might be undone by politically correct posturing.  That is not true.  THE FOUR FEATHERS doesn't have a political bone in its body.  Nobody bothers to explain what the Mahdi is fighting about, or even to mention that the Sudan of the movie's era is an Egyptian colony, not a British one.  Nothing in the movie suggests what difference it makes to either the British or the Sudanese whether the Mahdists win or not.  To those who don't already have an opinion, it's anybody's guess who has the right of this quarrel.  At the end, the movie becomes expressly apolitical.  As Harry's heroic friend Jack declares, the British Tommies don't fight for a flag or an idea. "We fight for the man on our left."  Actually, the movie might have benefited from more political content.  For one thing, it could have clarified why Abou, one of an unidentifed "tribe of slaves," is willing to help the British, who extinguished the slave trade throughout their empire in the 19th century.\n\nAs for the production values, Shekhar Kapur should be reported to the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Cameras for his constant torture of the focus control.  He doesn't appear to understand that making everything blurry will not make him a better artist.  Heath Ledger's role as Harry chiefly calls for him to cry a lot, which he does creditably.  Djimon Hounsou is almost unrecognizable in his part as Abou, with a beard, a weird hairstyle, and a light coating of dust, but he has never been more charismatic; there's no doubt why the feckless Harry clings to this rock of self-confidence.  Wes Bentley as one of Harry's former friends cuts a dashing figure and later does a convincing impression of disability.  Kate Hudson struggles in a ludicrous role.\n\nThis movie fails on many levels, but it could have overcome any of those failures except one: the weak hero.  It's not enough to make the protagonist suffer constantly to make us sympathize with him.  He has to be worthy of something more than suffering in the first place.\n\nRating: *1/2 out of ****\n\nRecommendation: Even action fans should skip this one."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33476,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-04-23","keywords":"male nudity,nudity,whipping,sex,naked dead man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Four Feathers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2549219609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJhODg4Y2QtOTYyMS00YzczLTljNTgtMzdlMWVmZTM3MjU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJhODg4Y2QtOTYyMS00YzczLTljNTgtMzdlMWVmZTM3MjU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Miramax"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005132/","name":"Heath Ledger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004747/","name":"Wes Bentley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005028/","name":"Kate Hudson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001408/","name":"Shekhar Kapur"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029177/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0556571/","name":"A.E.W.

It sounds weird, but for some reason, it shaped the sense of humor of a generation and possibly one of the inspirations that helped exceed the imagination and creativity of many cartoon shows that came after. The show itself has been terrific in its first three seasons, but after its first feature film, it slowly loses its touch until every character becomes something else other than what they were once known for. This latest Spongebob film might be the end of its glory as it seemingly panders the audience into another lame Alvin and the Chipmunks/The Smurfs approach, but surprisingly that only becomes a marketing stunt, and it turns out that most of the movie is basically just like the show, but at its original form. It didn't need any grand or blockbuster type of plot to save the material, we just need to revisit the stuff that we truly loved about Spongebob.\n\nOther than its creative animation and zany undersea world, Spongebob Squarepants has always been known for its richly established characters and unique sense of humor. I haven't seen the show in a while, specifically the newer episodes, but I do remember how the ones that followed season four have become paler incarnations of the show. This feature film, while stuck in posing as a typical family movie fare, is actually meant to stay loyal to what really defines this show. The characters have gone back to their classic personalities (Spongebob can now be reasonable again than just a complete goofball) and the humor is smartly priceless in an ultimately unhinged way. The film doesn't offer anymore bigger plot than retrieving the Krabby Patty secret formula, it's all about fooling at the audiences as it messes with the logic and their senses, the Spongebob way, of course.\n\nThe mix of animation and live-action is definitely never a stranger to Spongebob, but its involvement is often taken as a joke. Here, it's supposed to be its central idea. Though, it takes so long for them to get out of the water, in spite of its title, but when they do, it still sticks to its own surreal, extremely ludicrous style. But their welcoming antics up there felt forced, in comparison. The 3D stuff really exists to attract the viewers who thinks it's gonna be a cute adventure with the characters as silly superheroes, but it's mostly just a small payoff to those who have that expectation. It kind of cheats them, otherwise it's a cool trick for instead luring them to what makes this material so enjoyable. But we don't have to underestimate this approach too much, because apparently it's still pretty fun when they are in the real world, giving the humans some hilarious reactions, like the one who's wondering if the Krabby Patty he's eating is hallucinogenic after encountering the gang as superheroes.\n\nAs feature film goes, it doesn't go beyond bombastic, if it does then it's all about the weirdness instead of epic proportions. This is basically just like a new episode on a length of an actual movie. And the cast has always been great no matter what. Out of all the cartoons Tom Kenny has been, Spongebob will always be his best and he once again brings the lovable charm to the character. While Antonio Banderas makes a fun turn as the villain, but his moments are the one where he interacts to talking seagulls which amazingly works for this character.\n\nThe Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is what the fans deserve. Not sure how the newcomers would exactly react to it, but this movie fully represents the true spirit of the show. It would be a brilliant surprise to the ones who missed this great side of Spongebob. It didn't need any deeper sentiments or darkness (unless we're referring to its twisted humor, because it gets a little close to that.) Sure it's not the best episode ever either, but it has so many elements that remind us why we loved this show in the first place. The out-of-water scenes weren't as bad as many fans were worried about, it's just some randomly crazy addition to an already fun ride. Overall, it's more nostalgic than groundbreaking, I do hope this movie would be the salvation of this show. It won't change anyone's life or anything, we just like Spongebob to be Spongebob again and that's already given too much to a fan like me who grew up with the cartoon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52217,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-30","keywords":"dinosaur,formula,plankton,secret formula,bubble","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi421768985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After spending his entire life under the sea in the Bikini Bottom Gulch, Spongebob, Patrick and the rest of their friends go on a quest to find the stolen recipe for their Krabby Patty burgers, which brings them into our world, where they encounter a nefarious pirate named Burger-Beard.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444786/","name":"Tom Kenny"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0265067/","name":"Bill Fagerbakke"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1196684/","name":"Paul Tibbitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593610/","name":"Mike Mitchell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390995/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020957/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0008743/","name":"Jonathan Aibel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0074184/","name":"Glenn Berger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384864/","name":"Stephen Hillenburg"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It sounds weird, but for some reason, it shaped the sense of humor of a generation and possibly one of the inspirations that helped exceed the imagination and creativity of many cartoon shows that came after. The show itself has been terrific in its first three seasons, but after its first feature film, it slowly loses its touch until every character becomes something else other than what they were once known for. This latest Spongebob film might be the end of its glory as it seemingly panders the audience into another lame Alvin and the Chipmunks/The Smurfs approach, but surprisingly that only becomes a marketing stunt, and it turns out that most of the movie is basically just like the show, but at its original form. It didn't need any grand or blockbuster type of plot to save the material, we just need to revisit the stuff that we truly loved about Spongebob.\n\nOther than its creative animation and zany undersea world, Spongebob Squarepants has always been known for its richly established characters and unique sense of humor. I haven't seen the show in a while, specifically the newer episodes, but I do remember how the ones that followed season four have become paler incarnations of the show. This feature film, while stuck in posing as a typical family movie fare, is actually meant to stay loyal to what really defines this show. The characters have gone back to their classic personalities (Spongebob can now be reasonable again than just a complete goofball) and the humor is smartly priceless in an ultimately unhinged way. The film doesn't offer anymore bigger plot than retrieving the Krabby Patty secret formula, it's all about fooling at the audiences as it messes with the logic and their senses, the Spongebob way, of course.\n\nThe mix of animation and live-action is definitely never a stranger to Spongebob, but its involvement is often taken as a joke. Here, it's supposed to be its central idea. Though, it takes so long for them to get out of the water, in spite of its title, but when they do, it still sticks to its own surreal, extremely ludicrous style. But their welcoming antics up there felt forced, in comparison. The 3D stuff really exists to attract the viewers who thinks it's gonna be a cute adventure with the characters as silly superheroes, but it's mostly just a small payoff to those who have that expectation. It kind of cheats them, otherwise it's a cool trick for instead luring them to what makes this material so enjoyable. But we don't have to underestimate this approach too much, because apparently it's still pretty fun when they are in the real world, giving the humans some hilarious reactions, like the one who's wondering if the Krabby Patty he's eating is hallucinogenic after encountering the gang as superheroes.\n\nAs feature film goes, it doesn't go beyond bombastic, if it does then it's all about the weirdness instead of epic proportions. This is basically just like a new episode on a length of an actual movie. And the cast has always been great no matter what. Out of all the cartoons Tom Kenny has been, Spongebob will always be his best and he once again brings the lovable charm to the character. While Antonio Banderas makes a fun turn as the villain, but his moments are the one where he interacts to talking seagulls which amazingly works for this character.\n\nThe Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is what the fans deserve. Not sure how the newcomers would exactly react to it, but this movie fully represents the true spirit of the show. It would be a brilliant surprise to the ones who missed this great side of Spongebob. It didn't need any deeper sentiments or darkness (unless we're referring to its twisted humor, because it gets a little close to that.) Sure it's not the best episode ever either, but it has so many elements that remind us why we loved this show in the first place. The out-of-water scenes weren't as bad as many fans were worried about, it's just some randomly crazy addition to an already fun ride. Overall, it's more nostalgic than groundbreaking, I do hope this movie would be the salvation of this show. It won't change anyone's life or anything, we just like Spongebob to be Spongebob again and that's already given too much to a fan like me who grew up with the cartoon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52217,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-30","keywords":"dinosaur,formula,plankton,secret formula,bubble","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi421768985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After spending his entire life under the sea in the Bikini Bottom Gulch, Spongebob, Patrick and the rest of their friends go on a quest to find the stolen recipe for their Krabby Patty burgers, which brings them into our world, where they encounter a nefarious pirate named Burger-Beard.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444786/","name":"Tom Kenny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0265067/","name":"Bill Fagerbakke"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1196684/","name":"Paul Tibbitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593610/","name":"Mike Mitchell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390995/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020957/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0008743/","name":"Jonathan Aibel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0074184/","name":"Glenn Berger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384864/","name":"Stephen Hillenburg"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There was never a perfect person around. You just have half-angel and half-devil in you." \n\nThis line delivered by Linda Manz in Terrence Malick's gorgeous masterpiece, 'Days of Heaven,' sums up everything you need to know about life on earth. Much of Malick's themes have been devoted to man versus nature, and the idea of perfection is not outside that realm - imperfection is the nature of mankind.\n\nRichard Gere, in his greatest performance, plays Bill, a hot headed, lower class worker, who in a moment of mistake accidentally kills his boss in a Chicago factory. We see that the boss is hassling Bill, but we never know why, we just see faces but no distinguishable voices over the roar of the factory. Bill, his sister (Manz) and his girlfriend Abby, played by Brooke Adams, take off for the panhandle, hitching a ride on a train. Bill and Abby tell everyone that they are all brothers and sisters, because as you know, "people talk." They find work on a farm owned by the rich farmer, played by Sam Shepard. Many other films would make the farmer the bad guy, giving him trade mark heel characteristics, but Shepard's farmer, who we learn is dying, is soulful, and yearning for love. He see's Abby, and is interested, and eventually will ask her to stay - after Bill hears the doctor tell him he has about a year to live. They decide to stay, and after some persuasion from Bill, Abby will marry the dying farmer so that they can be heir to his fortune. Suspicions arise, and hearts and lives are broken, and the Days of Heaven will come to a halting end.\n\nThe cinematography is some of the most breathtaking ever captured on film. 'Days of Heaven' could even considered a masterpiece for its aesthetic beauty alone, if the story were not so terrific. Everything about the film is magnificent. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting and beautiful. You will remember it forever, along with Linda Manz' unforgettable narration, likely one of the greatest voice overs in film history. Many have criticized Malick's distancing techniques and muted emotions. We are always kept at arms length away. But these people don't realize that the story is a memory, a memory from the real main character - Linda. Also, in a method that Robert Bresson used, by distancing us emotionally, it leaves us to add our own emotions and imaginations in the story, heightening the power of the film, as long as you are willing not to be spoon-fed what to think.\n\nTerrence Malick is a filmmaker who came out of nowhere with his talents already fulfilled, and he has not stopped since. His films are filled with such heartbreaking beauty and symbolism, and he is one of the few living filmmakers who truly are creating art, rather than just entertainment. He had one of the greatest debuts ever, in the mesmerizing and haunting 'Badlands,' the deepest and most philosophical 'The Thin Red Line,' which is likely the greatest contemporary war film (as suggested by the late Gene Siskel)and the stunningly beautiful 'The New World.' His films are deep and meaningful, and to get into the underlying symbolism and themes of them here would be pointless, and better saved for a long essay.\n\nDays of Heaven is one of the greatest, and most beautiful films ever made. Cinema is at a low point recently, but as long as Terrence Malick is still making films, we still have some heavenly art to look forward to.\n\nPS - Hopefully someone like Criterion will create a new DVD, as the current one has some soundtrack problems. Imagine seeing it restored, visually and audibly.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55491,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1978-10-06","keywords":"farm,train,wealth,farm worker,seasonal work","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi320650777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000724/","name":"Brooke Adams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001731/","name":"Sam Shepard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It sounds weird, but for some reason, it shaped the sense of humor of a generation and possibly one of the inspirations that helped exceed the imagination and creativity of many cartoon shows that came after. The show itself has been terrific in its first three seasons, but after its first feature film, it slowly loses its touch until every character becomes something else other than what they were once known for. This latest Spongebob film might be the end of its glory as it seemingly panders the audience into another lame Alvin and the Chipmunks/The Smurfs approach, but surprisingly that only becomes a marketing stunt, and it turns out that most of the movie is basically just like the show, but at its original form. It didn't need any grand or blockbuster type of plot to save the material, we just need to revisit the stuff that we truly loved about Spongebob.\n\nOther than its creative animation and zany undersea world, Spongebob Squarepants has always been known for its richly established characters and unique sense of humor. I haven't seen the show in a while, specifically the newer episodes, but I do remember how the ones that followed season four have become paler incarnations of the show. This feature film, while stuck in posing as a typical family movie fare, is actually meant to stay loyal to what really defines this show. The characters have gone back to their classic personalities (Spongebob can now be reasonable again than just a complete goofball) and the humor is smartly priceless in an ultimately unhinged way. The film doesn't offer anymore bigger plot than retrieving the Krabby Patty secret formula, it's all about fooling at the audiences as it messes with the logic and their senses, the Spongebob way, of course.\n\nThe mix of animation and live-action is definitely never a stranger to Spongebob, but its involvement is often taken as a joke. Here, it's supposed to be its central idea. Though, it takes so long for them to get out of the water, in spite of its title, but when they do, it still sticks to its own surreal, extremely ludicrous style. But their welcoming antics up there felt forced, in comparison. The 3D stuff really exists to attract the viewers who thinks it's gonna be a cute adventure with the characters as silly superheroes, but it's mostly just a small payoff to those who have that expectation. It kind of cheats them, otherwise it's a cool trick for instead luring them to what makes this material so enjoyable. But we don't have to underestimate this approach too much, because apparently it's still pretty fun when they are in the real world, giving the humans some hilarious reactions, like the one who's wondering if the Krabby Patty he's eating is hallucinogenic after encountering the gang as superheroes.\n\nAs feature film goes, it doesn't go beyond bombastic, if it does then it's all about the weirdness instead of epic proportions. This is basically just like a new episode on a length of an actual movie. And the cast has always been great no matter what. Out of all the cartoons Tom Kenny has been, Spongebob will always be his best and he once again brings the lovable charm to the character. While Antonio Banderas makes a fun turn as the villain, but his moments are the one where he interacts to talking seagulls which amazingly works for this character.\n\nThe Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is what the fans deserve. Not sure how the newcomers would exactly react to it, but this movie fully represents the true spirit of the show. It would be a brilliant surprise to the ones who missed this great side of Spongebob. It didn't need any deeper sentiments or darkness (unless we're referring to its twisted humor, because it gets a little close to that.) Sure it's not the best episode ever either, but it has so many elements that remind us why we loved this show in the first place. The out-of-water scenes weren't as bad as many fans were worried about, it's just some randomly crazy addition to an already fun ride. Overall, it's more nostalgic than groundbreaking, I do hope this movie would be the salvation of this show. It won't change anyone's life or anything, we just like Spongebob to be Spongebob again and that's already given too much to a fan like me who grew up with the cartoon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52217,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-30","keywords":"dinosaur,formula,plankton,secret formula,bubble","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi421768985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After spending his entire life under the sea in the Bikini Bottom Gulch, Spongebob, Patrick and the rest of their friends go on a quest to find the stolen recipe for their Krabby Patty burgers, which brings them into our world, where they encounter a nefarious pirate named Burger-Beard.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444786/","name":"Tom Kenny"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0265067/","name":"Bill Fagerbakke"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1196684/","name":"Paul Tibbitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593610/","name":"Mike Mitchell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390995/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020957/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0008743/","name":"Jonathan Aibel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0074184/","name":"Glenn Berger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384864/","name":"Stephen Hillenburg"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

At the movie's beginning, we are informed that over 100,000 wild mustangs roam in the US, from which several hundreds are taken to prisons each year for training by inmates. The opening scenes bring us one of those round-ups, as a chopper is directing a herd of mustangs towards captivity. We are introduced to Roman, locked up (for what crime?) in a maximum security prison in Nevada. "I'm not good with people", he tells the reclassification officer, so she puts him in the outdoor maintenance program. Initially it's just cleaning up horse manure, but eventually he gets to work with one of the mustangs. In a parallel story, Roman is visited by his highly pregnant daughter, and their meeting is - strained... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the feature length directing debut of Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre (better known for her acting career in France), and what a debut it is! She also co-wrote the script. She brings a multi-faceted story: yes, there is the redemption side where a hardened criminal finds new hope when bonding with a mustang, but there is also the complicated father-daughter angle (which surprised me on several occasions as that played out), and of course there is the aspect of life in prison. Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts was made to play the role of Roman: a very physical yet nuanced performance (in the same way that it reminded me of Marlon Brando--but I'm not saying that Schoenaerts is in the league of Brando!). Bruce Dern has a small role as the heard of the mustang training program. The photography is eye-candy from start to finish. And then there are the mustangs, themselves a character in the movie. In the end, the biggest treasure that was uncovered in this film may well be Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre. I can't wait to see what she will do next. (Please note that Robert Redford is credited as Executive Producer.)\n\n"The Mustang" premiered to immediate acclaim at this year's Sundance film festival, It is not a coincidence that this movie is currently certified 95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.

At the movie's beginning, we are informed that over 100,000 wild mustangs roam in the US, from which several hundreds are taken to prisons each year for training by inmates. The opening scenes bring us one of those round-ups, as a chopper is directing a herd of mustangs towards captivity. We are introduced to Roman, locked up (for what crime?) in a maximum security prison in Nevada. "I'm not good with people", he tells the reclassification officer, so she puts him in the outdoor maintenance program. Initially it's just cleaning up horse manure, but eventually he gets to work with one of the mustangs. In a parallel story, Roman is visited by his highly pregnant daughter, and their meeting is - strained... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the feature length directing debut of Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre (better known for her acting career in France), and what a debut it is! She also co-wrote the script. She brings a multi-faceted story: yes, there is the redemption side where a hardened criminal finds new hope when bonding with a mustang, but there is also the complicated father-daughter angle (which surprised me on several occasions as that played out), and of course there is the aspect of life in prison. Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts was made to play the role of Roman: a very physical yet nuanced performance (in the same way that it reminded me of Marlon Brando--but I'm not saying that Schoenaerts is in the league of Brando!). Bruce Dern has a small role as the heard of the mustang training program. The photography is eye-candy from start to finish. And then there are the mustangs, themselves a character in the movie. In the end, the biggest treasure that was uncovered in this film may well be Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre. I can't wait to see what she will do next. (Please note that Robert Redford is credited as Executive Producer.)\n\n"The Mustang" premiered to immediate acclaim at this year's Sundance film festival, It is not a coincidence that this movie is currently certified 95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. "The Mustang" recently opened at my art-house movie theater here in Cincinnati. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (5 people to be exact, myself included). That is a shame. Maybe the movie will find a wider audience as it is released in different formats.

There was never a perfect person around. You just have half-angel and half-devil in you." \n\nThis line delivered by Linda Manz in Terrence Malick's gorgeous masterpiece, 'Days of Heaven,' sums up everything you need to know about life on earth. Much of Malick's themes have been devoted to man versus nature, and the idea of perfection is not outside that realm - imperfection is the nature of mankind.\n\nRichard Gere, in his greatest performance, plays Bill, a hot headed, lower class worker, who in a moment of mistake accidentally kills his boss in a Chicago factory. We see that the boss is hassling Bill, but we never know why, we just see faces but no distinguishable voices over the roar of the factory. Bill, his sister (Manz) and his girlfriend Abby, played by Brooke Adams, take off for the panhandle, hitching a ride on a train. Bill and Abby tell everyone that they are all brothers and sisters, because as you know, "people talk." They find work on a farm owned by the rich farmer, played by Sam Shepard. Many other films would make the farmer the bad guy, giving him trade mark heel characteristics, but Shepard's farmer, who we learn is dying, is soulful, and yearning for love. He see's Abby, and is interested, and eventually will ask her to stay - after Bill hears the doctor tell him he has about a year to live. They decide to stay, and after some persuasion from Bill, Abby will marry the dying farmer so that they can be heir to his fortune. Suspicions arise, and hearts and lives are broken, and the Days of Heaven will come to a halting end.\n\nThe cinematography is some of the most breathtaking ever captured on film. 'Days of Heaven' could even considered a masterpiece for its aesthetic beauty alone, if the story were not so terrific. Everything about the film is magnificent. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting and beautiful. You will remember it forever, along with Linda Manz' unforgettable narration, likely one of the greatest voice overs in film history. Many have criticized Malick's distancing techniques and muted emotions. We are always kept at arms length away. But these people don't realize that the story is a memory, a memory from the real main character - Linda. Also, in a method that Robert Bresson used, by distancing us emotionally, it leaves us to add our own emotions and imaginations in the story, heightening the power of the film, as long as you are willing not to be spoon-fed what to think.\n\nTerrence Malick is a filmmaker who came out of nowhere with his talents already fulfilled, and he has not stopped since. His films are filled with such heartbreaking beauty and symbolism, and he is one of the few living filmmakers who truly are creating art, rather than just entertainment. He had one of the greatest debuts ever, in the mesmerizing and haunting 'Badlands,' the deepest and most philosophical 'The Thin Red Line,' which is likely the greatest contemporary war film (as suggested by the late Gene Siskel)and the stunningly beautiful 'The New World.' His films are deep and meaningful, and to get into the underlying symbolism and themes of them here would be pointless, and better saved for a long essay.\n\nDays of Heaven is one of the greatest, and most beautiful films ever made. Cinema is at a low point recently, but as long as Terrence Malick is still making films, we still have some heavenly art to look forward to.\n\nPS - Hopefully someone like Criterion will create a new DVD, as the current one has some soundtrack problems. Imagine seeing it restored, visually and audibly.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55491,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1978-10-06","keywords":"farm,train,wealth,farm worker,seasonal work","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi320650777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000724/","name":"Brooke Adams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001731/","name":"Sam Shepard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Gavras is bold and shows high tensions, clear colors of the circus we live in, luck of democracy, solid reasons for criticism of an amateur leftist government including Yianis and a great Lulis acting this role. The finale though is weak imo. A solid 6! - but we must revisit the film a few years later.

Gavras is bold and shows high tensions, clear colors of the circus we live in, luck of democracy, solid reasons for criticism of an amateur leftist government including Yianis and a great Lulis acting this role. The finale though is weak imo. A solid 6! - but we must revisit the film a few years later.

At the movie's beginning, we are informed that over 100,000 wild mustangs roam in the US, from which several hundreds are taken to prisons each year for training by inmates. The opening scenes bring us one of those round-ups, as a chopper is directing a herd of mustangs towards captivity. We are introduced to Roman, locked up (for what crime?) in a maximum security prison in Nevada. "I'm not good with people", he tells the reclassification officer, so she puts him in the outdoor maintenance program. Initially it's just cleaning up horse manure, but eventually he gets to work with one of the mustangs. In a parallel story, Roman is visited by his highly pregnant daughter, and their meeting is - strained... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the feature length directing debut of Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre (better known for her acting career in France), and what a debut it is!

At the movie's beginning, we are informed that over 100,000 wild mustangs roam in the US, from which several hundreds are taken to prisons each year for training by inmates. The opening scenes bring us one of those round-ups, as a chopper is directing a herd of mustangs towards captivity. We are introduced to Roman, locked up (for what crime?) in a maximum security prison in Nevada. "I'm not good with people", he tells the reclassification officer, so she puts him in the outdoor maintenance program. Initially it's just cleaning up horse manure, but eventually he gets to work with one of the mustangs. In a parallel story, Roman is visited by his highly pregnant daughter, and their meeting is - strained... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the feature length directing debut of Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre (better known for her acting career in France), and what a debut it is! She also co-wrote the script. She brings a multi-faceted story: yes, there is the redemption side where a hardened criminal finds new hope when bonding with a mustang, but there is also the complicated father-daughter angle (which surprised me on several occasions as that played out), and of course there is the aspect of life in prison. Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts was made to play the role of Roman: a very physical yet nuanced performance (in the same way that it reminded me of Marlon Brando--but I'm not saying that Schoenaerts is in the league of Brando!). Bruce Dern has a small role as the heard of the mustang training program. The photography is eye-candy from start to finish. And then there are the mustangs, themselves a character in the movie.

 --- Description: Das Vorspiel: Directed by Ina Weisse. With Nina Hoss, Sophie Rois, Thorsten Merten, Franziska Fauth. Anna Bronsky is a violin teacher at the Conservatoire. Against the advice of her colleagues, she imposes the admission of a pupil, in whom she sees a great talent. With a lot of involvement, she prepares Alexander for the end-of-year exam and neglects her young son Jonas, who is also a violinist and ice hockey fan. She moves away more and more from her husband, so fond of him, the French "luthier" Philippe Bronsky. At the approach of audition, Anna pushes Alexander towards performances more and more exceptional.

A 46 year old man is at the end of his tether, and all around him are strangers in his family who do not know him, and strangers outside of him who deprive him of the only job he has ever had. He loves only an inaccessible youth and like Aschenbach in ' Death in Venice ' he sees him as the embodiment of beauty, when the youth is all too pathetically human. The film is anything but rough in its direction, and the acting is superb. It is not an easy film to watch, but then the finest works of art are ( and should be ) challenging and difficult. The music underlines this and rarely has music been so well used. There is a scene in mud fields that moved me a lot and the music in that scene was excellent and added to the ' Wozzeck ' feel I had throughout the film. It had echoes of Alban Berg who put the Buchner play to music and made it one of the greatest and hardest Opera's to watch and bear.

A 46 year old man is at the end of his tether, and all around him are strangers in his family who do not know him, and strangers outside of him who deprive him of the only job he has ever had. He loves only an inaccessible youth and like Aschenbach in ' Death in Venice ' he sees him as the embodiment of beauty, when the youth is all too pathetically human. The film is anything but rough in its direction, and the acting is superb. It is not an easy film to watch, but then the finest works of art are ( and should be ) challenging and difficult. The music underlines this and rarely has music been so well used. There is a scene in mud fields that moved me a lot and the music in that scene was excellent and added to the ' Wozzeck ' feel I had throughout the film. It had echoes of Alban Berg who put the Buchner play to music and made it one of the greatest and hardest Opera's to watch and bear. But like all works that work at the highest level ' Rialto ' left me with a gift, and that is the gift of further understanding mankind, and the complexities of being human, plus the extremities of abuse that are inflicted constantly on us as human beings. Rialto was that part of Venice where Aschenbach stayed in ' Death in Venice '.

While many other reviewers noted this too, I'd like to point out that those critics and possibly some of the people who 'dont like Tom Cruise because of his weird religion' are actually following the same path that made it possible for Hitler to kill off millions of Jews who also had a 'weird religion'.

It's hard to tell a story about a time that has been long gone, yet is in people's memories trough books and history lessons in school. Nevertheless - creators of "Blizzard of souls" are touching audiences with the simplicity, with extracted one person perspective, one joy and love, one... This is actually extremely hard to shine light on history trough a personal journey trough war days and relationships that are formed by the rush of war - everyone understands the urgency to take action and live this very second, to fullest, since there's great chance that might be the last sunrise, last meal, last kiss. Yet everyone is hoping to be able to live long enough to have that peace after.. Movie balances, telling us all the mix of emotions via superb camera work, brilliant movie soundtrack and acting that is heavenly simple and to the point. Some of the episodes are proudly written in the golden heritage of Latvian cinema, some will be.

It's hard to tell a story about a time that has been long gone, yet is in people's memories trough books and history lessons in school. Nevertheless - creators of "Blizzard of souls" are touching audiences with the simplicity, with extracted one person perspective, one joy and love, one... This is actually extremely hard to shine light on history trough a personal journey trough war days and relationships that are formed by the rush of war - everyone understands the urgency to take action and live this very second, to fullest, since there's great chance that might be the last sunrise, last meal, last kiss. Yet everyone is hoping to be able to live long enough to have that peace after.. Movie balances, telling us all the mix of emotions via superb camera work, brilliant movie soundtrack and acting that is heavenly simple and to the point. Some of the episodes are proudly written in the golden heritage of Latvian cinema, some will be.

Ip Man was the Wing Chun grandmaster and his most famous student was Bruce Lee. This film chronicles the years leading up to his success as a martial arts teacher. It stars Tony Leung Chiu-Wai as Ip Man and Zhang Ziyi as Gong Er, his main love interest. Kar Wai Wong directed and co-wrote the movie (with Jingzhi Zou and Haofeng Xu). Wong is famous for directing and writing other popular Hong Kong period piece dramas like '2046' and 'IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE'. I'd rate this flick about the same as Wong's others; I thought it was extremely beautiful to look at but it's also a tad too hard to follow and uninvolving.\n\nThe story focuses as much on Gong Er (Ziyi) as it does Ip Man and follows a love story between the two as they keep in contact for many years following a fight for Gong's family's honor. Ip Man had defeated her father, Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang) in a battle that was as much about philosophical ideas as combat. The film follows Ip Man's years during the Second Sino-Japanese War, in 1938, struggling through poverty with his family. It also focuses on Gong Er's attempt at vengeance against the man who murdered her father, Ma San (Zhang Jin).\n\nThe story is told in a very disjointed way and it was really hard for me to keep up with what was going on in it. I often find these epic Hong Kong Kung Fu flicks to be dull anyway and wasn't too interested in seeing this one. It did get mostly good reviews from critics though and it's nominated for two 2014 Oscars (in Cinematography and Costume Design). It definitely deserves those award nominations and is very breathtaking to look at. I also think Zhang Ziyi is one of the more beautiful and sexy women in cinema today and she gives a great performance here. I'm not sure how I feel about Leung Chiu-Wai as an actor, he's not bad in this movie but I didn't really learn to care for his character much at all. The martial-arts scenes are grand and epic though and I'm sure fans of the genre will be more than pleased.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTUUB4nMD6M","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32958,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-01-08","keywords":"ip man character,falling off a balcony,girl,crying,starving to death","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4109412633","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTc5NTA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMDc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTc5NTA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMDc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A story inspired by the life and times of the legendary kung fu master, Ip Man, and set in the tumultuous Republican era that followed the fall of ChinaÂ’s last dynasty, a time of chaos, division and war that was also the golden age of Chinese martial arts."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504897/","name":"Tony Chiu-Wai Leung"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1018221/","name":"Jin Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939182/","name":"Kar-Wai Wong"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070147/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074316/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239007/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939182/","name":"Kar-Wai Wong"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1802940/","name":"Jingzhi Zou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4192630/","name":"Haofeng Xu"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Sherlock Holmes bivši je savjetnik Scotland Yarda, koji zbog svoje ovisnosti o drogama kreće prema New Yorku kako bi se liječio u centru za odvikavanje od opijata. Genij logičnog zaključivanja odluči ostati u New Yorku kada shvati da grad obiluje zločinima i zanimljivim zagonetnim slučajevima. Zabrinut za sina, Sherlockov otac šalje Joan Watson uspješnu kirurginju kako bi pazila na njega i držala ga dalje od iskušenja i poroka. I nakon isteka ugovora, Joan ostaje živjeti s Holmesom, koji joj ponudi posao asistentice, priznavši koliko mu znače njezina pomoć, prisutnost i sabranost. U lovu na zločince, Holmesu se pridružuju Thomas "Toby" Gregson, kapetan njujorške policije, koji je i sam nekoć bio član Scotland Yarda, dijela odjela za borbu protiv terorizma. Dvojica starih poznanika, koji se međusobno cijene, ponovno se susreću u New Yorku. U istragama im pomaže i detektiv Marcus Bell, Gregsonov asistent, koji se u početku protivi Holmesovom uplitanju u rješavanje slučajeva, no ubrzo shvati da bi se bez Holmesove pomoći kriminalci vjerojatno izvukli.</desc>

Sherlock Holmes bivši je savjetnik Scotland Yarda, koji zbog svoje ovisnosti o drogama kreće prema New Yorku kako bi se liječio u centru za odvikavanje od opijata. Genij logičnog zaključivanja odluči ostati u New Yorku kada shvati da grad obiluje zločinima i zanimljivim zagonetnim slučajevima. Zabrinut za sina, Sherlockov otac šalje Joan Watson uspješnu kirurginju kako bi pazila na njega i držala ga dalje od iskušenja i poroka. I nakon isteka ugovora, Joan ostaje živjeti s Holmesom, koji joj ponudi posao asistentice, priznavši koliko mu znače njezina pomoć, prisutnost i sabranost. U lovu na zločince, Holmesu se pridružuju Thomas "Toby" Gregson, kapetan njujorške policije, koji je i sam nekoć bio član Scotland Yarda, dijela odjela za borbu protiv terorizma. Dvojica starih poznanika, koji se međusobno cijene, ponovno se susreću u New Yorku. U istragama im pomaže i detektiv Marcus Bell, Gregsonov asistent, koji se u početku protivi Holmesovom uplitanju u rješavanje slučajeva, no ubrzo shvati da bi se bez Holmesove pomoći kriminalci vjerojatno izvukli.</desc>

Sherlock Holmes bivši je savjetnik Scotland Yarda, koji zbog svoje ovisnosti o drogama kreće prema New Yorku kako bi se liječio u centru za odvikavanje od opijata. Genij logičnog zaključivanja odluči ostati u New Yorku kada shvati da grad obiluje zločinima i zanimljivim zagonetnim slučajevima. Zabrinut za sina, Sherlockov otac šalje Joan Watson uspješnu kirurginju kako bi pazila na njega i držala ga dalje od iskušenja i poroka. I nakon isteka ugovora, Joan ostaje živjeti s Holmesom, koji joj ponudi posao asistentice, priznavši koliko mu znače njezina pomoć, prisutnost i sabranost. U lovu na zločince, Holmesu se pridružuju Thomas "Toby" Gregson, kapetan njujorške policije, koji je i sam nekoć bio član Scotland Yarda, dijela odjela za borbu protiv terorizma. Dvojica starih poznanika, koji se međusobno cijene, ponovno se susreću u New Yorku. U istragama im pomaže i detektiv Marcus Bell, Gregsonov asistent, koji se u početku protivi Holmesovom uplitanju u rješavanje slučajeva, no ubrzo shvati da bi se bez Holmesove pomoći kriminalci vjerojatno izvukli.</desc>

Sherlock Holmes bivši je savjetnik Scotland Yarda, koji zbog svoje ovisnosti o drogama kreće prema New Yorku kako bi se liječio u centru za odvikavanje od opijata. Genij logičnog zaključivanja odluči ostati u New Yorku kada shvati da grad obiluje zločinima i zanimljivim zagonetnim slučajevima. Zabrinut za sina, Sherlockov otac šalje Joan Watson uspješnu kirurginju kako bi pazila na njega i držala ga dalje od iskušenja i poroka. I nakon isteka ugovora, Joan ostaje živjeti s Holmesom, koji joj ponudi posao asistentice, priznavši koliko mu znače njezina pomoć, prisutnost i sabranost. U lovu na zločince, Holmesu se pridružuju Thomas "Toby" Gregson, kapetan njujorške policije, koji je i sam nekoć bio član Scotland Yarda, dijela odjela za borbu protiv terorizma. Dvojica starih poznanika, koji se međusobno cijene, ponovno se susreću u New Yorku. U istragama im pomaže i detektiv Marcus Bell, Gregsonov asistent, koji se u početku protivi Holmesovom uplitanju u rješavanje slučajeva, no ubrzo shvati da bi se bez Holmesove pomoći kriminalci vjerojatno izvukli.</desc>

It seemed too gimmicky and redundant. Yeah, yet another pair of ill-suited, mismatched detectives "forced" to work together blah blah... But, I'm glad I watched a couple of more episodes. They made some right turns in the development of the characters and their relationships. I appreciated they toned down the macho animosity and even turned the Shade/Maz dynamic into a sort of reluctant buddy kind of thing. I'm really tired of all the hatred and competitiveness in everything you see these days. This show takes me back to the last century (I can't believe I'm old enough to say that!) and PI shows like Harry O, Rockford and Magnum (the REAL one). Lighthearted humor and a little escape from reality in a relaxing manner is a welcome change from all the explosions and shootouts and car crashes and helicopter crashes and plane crashes and military invasions and, well... you get it. Oh, did I mention all the shouting and backstabbing and assaulting and battering of the "reality" shows? Thanks for "Private Eyes". I'm glad it's still on.\n\nAddendum: The way I rate shows... I don't usually review anything less than a 7 because 6 would be a failing grade and I won't waste my time watching it. I'm old; I don't know how much time I've got left.

It seemed too gimmicky and redundant. Yeah, yet another pair of ill-suited, mismatched detectives "forced" to work together blah blah... But, I'm glad I watched a couple of more episodes. They made some right turns in the development of the characters and their relationships. I appreciated they toned down the macho animosity and even turned the Shade/Maz dynamic into a sort of reluctant buddy kind of thing. I'm really tired of all the hatred and competitiveness in everything you see these days. This show takes me back to the last century (I can't believe I'm old enough to say that!) and PI shows like Harry O, Rockford and Magnum (the REAL one). Lighthearted humor and a little escape from reality in a relaxing manner is a welcome change from all the explosions and shootouts and car crashes and helicopter crashes and plane crashes and military invasions and, well... you get it. Oh, did I mention all the shouting and backstabbing and assaulting and battering of the "reality" shows? Thanks for "Private Eyes". I'm glad it's still on.\n\nAddendum: The way I rate shows... I don't usually review anything less than a 7 because 6 would be a failing grade and I won't waste my time watching it. I'm old; I don't know how much time I've got left. Since I probably turned it off before getting even halfway through, it wouldn't be fair to rate or review it. 7 is watchable but I may go a while between episodes since, though somewhat entertaining, there are other shows more interesting or compelling. 8 would be a regular in my lineup. 9 is a must see and probably bingeable. 10 is just the epitome of superbity and headed for my all-time favorites list.

    <desc lang="hr">Nakon Charliejeve smrti, milijarder Walden useljava se u kuću na plaži s Alanom i Jakeom. Depresivan, Walden se oslanja na Alana koji će ga trenirati. Charlie Harper (Charlie Sheen) živi dobar život kao uspješan pisac džingla u primorskom dvorcu u Los Angelesu. Ovaj se život naglo zaustavlja kad se dosele njegov brat Alan i 10-godišnji nećak Jake. Sada, ne samo da se mora nositi s njima, već i s Rose, njegovom susjedom iz susjedstva i Bertom, njegovom sarkastičnom domaćicom.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Teorija velikog praska</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Deseta sezona staroj ekipi donosi u život nove ljude poput djeteta Howarda i Bernadette, ali ljubavni problemi svih genijalaca su i dalje prisutni. U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

There are too many crime shows. Josh Schwarz delivers tongue in cheek humor and a good likable cast. It's a Dr Quinn meets Sweet Home Alabama story and it's quite charming. Zoe moves from NYC to Bluebell Alabama to practice medicine. The culture differences do provide enough laughs.\n\nRachel Bilson is Rachel Bilson just like Audrey Hepburn was always Audrey Hepburn. She may not be that convincing as a doctor but who cares - she is likable and manages to carry a series. The series relies on the other cast members equally. Jaimie King is pretty and acts well as the high strung Southern Belle Lemon.

I've loved most of his movies, including the two previous movies he's directed, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. I've seen each many times, and they are two of my favorite comedies. \n\nThis, however, didn't prepare me for his newest, Funny People. Apatow has become well known for his sweet, adult comedies, but this movie is very different from his others. I would almost call it a "funny drama." This has it's pros and cons. I don't think I laughed out loud as much as in either of the other two films, but what I got in return, is an actual good movie, that's actually ABOUT something.\n\nI liked Adam Sandler before I knew what a good movie was, as I grew up watching his lighter movies, like Waterboy, Happy Gilmore, etc. I've seen him so much that he ceased becoming an actor to me and actually reached a point of self-parody. His role as comedian George Simmons is perfect for him, because he's basically playing himself, to a point. He gives the performance of his life, even better than Punch-Drunk- Love. His portrayal is cold and confused, angry and hurt. It's what a comedian might truly be like when he's not on stage. He plays it perfectly, providing a likable character while at the same time showing us there might not be so much to like. He's the best part of this movie, and that's saying something\n\nThe supporting cast is great, as usual. Seth Rogan actually plays a different character than his other movies as Ira, who acts as a great foil to George Simmons. Jason Schwartzman and Jonah Hill provide some great comedic backup, including their hilarious fictional sitcom "Yo, Teach". In fact, a lot of the laugh out loud comedy from the film stems from the many supporting performances and cameos (My favorites being Marshall Mathers and James Taylor). Eric Bana is very funny, and Leslie Mann gives an impressive performance as well.\n\nFunny People's only real problem is it's ambition, and that's definitely the best problem to have. It's nearly two and a half hours, and while I didn't have a problem with the length, it obviously had to end when it did, as there aren't many people who would want to sit through a three hour comedy.

I've loved most of his movies, including the two previous movies he's directed, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. I've seen each many times, and they are two of my favorite comedies. \n\nThis, however, didn't prepare me for his newest, Funny People. Apatow has become well known for his sweet, adult comedies, but this movie is very different from his others. I would almost call it a "funny drama." This has it's pros and cons. I don't think I laughed out loud as much as in either of the other two films, but what I got in return, is an actual good movie, that's actually ABOUT something.\n\nI liked Adam Sandler before I knew what a good movie was, as I grew up watching his lighter movies, like Waterboy, Happy Gilmore, etc. I've seen him so much that he ceased becoming an actor to me and actually reached a point of self-parody. His role as comedian George Simmons is perfect for him, because he's basically playing himself, to a point. He gives the performance of his life, even better than Punch-Drunk- Love. His portrayal is cold and confused, angry and hurt. It's what a comedian might truly be like when he's not on stage. He plays it perfectly, providing a likable character while at the same time showing us there might not be so much to like. He's the best part of this movie, and that's saying something\n\nThe supporting cast is great, as usual. Seth Rogan actually plays a different character than his other movies as Ira, who acts as a great foil to George Simmons. Jason Schwartzman and Jonah Hill provide some great comedic backup, including their hilarious fictional sitcom "Yo, Teach". In fact, a lot of the laugh out loud comedy from the film stems from the many supporting performances and cameos (My favorites being Marshall Mathers and James Taylor). Eric Bana is very funny, and Leslie Mann gives an impressive performance as well.\n\nFunny People's only real problem is it's ambition, and that's definitely the best problem to have. It's nearly two and a half hours, and while I didn't have a problem with the length, it obviously had to end when it did, as there aren't many people who would want to sit through a three hour comedy. I wish it could have ran even longer, as some subplots weren't fleshed out nearly enough. I really liked the romance between Ira and Daisy (Played by Aubrey Plaza, who is sweet and funny in every scene she's in), but it was rushed, and in the end cut short, which is a shame, because it's one of the best parts of the movie.\n\nAbove all, this is a real movie. It's success doesn't just depend on the amount of laughs it receives. Thanks to Sandler and a thought provoking story, this is more than just another raunchy-sweet comedy.

Oops! Can't say that because of FCC guidelines. Just the same, the title pretty much describes the level of the humor in this Ben Stiller comedy. But that's redundant because it IS a Ben Stiller movie. Clearly my expectations for this movie were not high and, maybe because of that, I found "Meet the Fockers" quite funny.\n\nDon't get me wrong. This is not a movie for everyone. First off, the writers did not miss a single opportunity to play off of the name "Focker". It's silly and gets a little old but it somehow works with the other repetitious low-down gags.\n\nFocker is the family name for Greg (Focker), Ben Stiller. The funniest Fockers, however, (now I'm doing it) are Greg's parents Bernie and Roz, a loose and liberal Florida hippy couple still living in the last century and enjoying every minute of it. Dustin Hoffman, as Bernie displays a previously unrevealed talent for over the top comedy. Fitting perfectly with Hoffman's Bernie, is Barbra Streisand as Roz Focker, reminiscent of the "zaftig" Lainie Kazan. Bernie is a yesteryear lawyer who has not practiced since who knows when. Roz is the main breadwinner from her business as a sex therapist to the elderly.\n\nGreg is not too eager to reveal his parents' true nature to his fiancée's parents as they all come to visit to get to know one another better. Teri Polo nicely plays Greg's fiancée Pam. Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner play her stiff and straight parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes. Oh  also add in some baby low-brow by Spencer and Bradley Pickeren, two adorable twins playing Little Jack.\n\nSo, go low, go loose -- or don't go at all -- but if you like Ben Stiller, go see "Meet the Fockers". Dustin's antics will crack you up and you'll enjoy Barbra back on the big screen after so long.

That's to say, Ford appears, acts and just plain feels like he should be President. (Come one who saw this movie and wanted him to run). Gary Oldman's performance as the main villain (Ivan) should be up there with the likes of Alan Rickman's Hans from Die Hard and John Malkovich's Leary-Booth-Carney from In the Line of Fire (coincidentally directed by Wolfgang Peterson as well). Glenn Close pulls of the Vice President role with smirks and spunk.\n\nStars aside I think the supporting cast should get an equal if not harder pat on the back. These guys and girls . really made the movie. They're the ones that brought the chuckles and caused gasps. Wendy Crewson (The Good Son) nailed her role with more grace than a first lady has actually shown in the last recallable years. Paul Guilfoyle ("CSI", The Negotiator), was the kind gentle, "best buddy", chief-of-staff, who brought a small smile to your face every time he is on-screen. Xander Berkeley ("24", Terminator 2), plays the chilling secret service agent Gibbs. The lovable William H. Macy plays the good-mannered Air Force Officer who puts himself in harm's way for the President more time than the Secret Service agents do. He just doesn't get enough screen time toward the beginning. And Dean Stockwell will have you cussing under your breath as the power-hungry Secretary of Defense. And it seems that Wolfgang Peterson watched every great Action/Military movie of the past 3 years and hired all those "briefing room generals". For this I applaud him. As for the terrorist, they rival those of Die hard. Cold, stone-faced, funny, smooth, and just plain hateable, they did their job.\n\nThe bulk of the movie takes place aboard the Air Force One no kidding eh?). And boy do you believe it. The production designer (Williams Sandell) obviously paid attention to detail, mimicking the real Presidential Aircraft. Small, claustrophobic and believable.\n\nAndrew W. Marlowe's script gets it job done as well. Nothing award winning. It's everything you would expect given the story it has to tell. Couple times it will make you cringe, but again, look what it needs to accomplish.\n\nThe late Jerry Goldsmith's score for this movie is a hands down classic. Only having two weeks to score the film after Peterson rejected Randy Newman's work, Goldsmith with the help of Joel Mcneely composed one of the most bombastic, riveting, emotional, suspenseful, and patriotic scores I've heard come out of the film world. It works perfectly with the movie.\n\nA few times your mind is going to be stretch you may have to resort to the "It's just a movie" mindset. Overall its fun. Not a bad way to spend 2 hours. Harrison Ford for President.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":187360,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-07-25","keywords":"airplane hijacking,terrorist,terrorism,vietnam war veteran,first lady of the united states of america","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3680287513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFkNzYyZjAtMzcxYy00ZTk3LWFiNjktYjgyZDZjMGUwYTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFkNzYyZjAtMzcxYy00ZTk3LWFiNjktYjgyZDZjMGUwYTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000335/","name":"Glenn Close"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000583/","name":"Wolfgang Petersen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064908/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005233/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

That's to say, Ford appears, acts and just plain feels like he should be President. (Come one who saw this movie and wanted him to run). Gary Oldman's performance as the main villain (Ivan) should be up there with the likes of Alan Rickman's Hans from Die Hard and John Malkovich's Leary-Booth-Carney from In the Line of Fire (coincidentally directed by Wolfgang Peterson as well). Glenn Close pulls of the Vice President role with smirks and spunk.\n\nStars aside I think the supporting cast should get an equal if not harder pat on the back. These guys and girls . really made the movie. They're the ones that brought the chuckles and caused gasps. Wendy Crewson (The Good Son) nailed her role with more grace than a first lady has actually shown in the last recallable years. Paul Guilfoyle ("CSI", The Negotiator), was the kind gentle, "best buddy", chief-of-staff, who brought a small smile to your face every time he is on-screen. Xander Berkeley ("24", Terminator 2), plays the chilling secret service agent Gibbs. The lovable William H. Macy plays the good-mannered Air Force Officer who puts himself in harm's way for the President more time than the Secret Service agents do. He just doesn't get enough screen time toward the beginning. And Dean Stockwell will have you cussing under your breath as the power-hungry Secretary of Defense. And it seems that Wolfgang Peterson watched every great Action/Military movie of the past 3 years and hired all those "briefing room generals". For this I applaud him. As for the terrorist, they rival those of Die hard. Cold, stone-faced, funny, smooth, and just plain hateable, they did their job.\n\nThe bulk of the movie takes place aboard the Air Force One no kidding eh?). And boy do you believe it. The production designer (Williams Sandell) obviously paid attention to detail, mimicking the real Presidential Aircraft. Small, claustrophobic and believable.\n\nAndrew W. Marlowe's script gets it job done as well. Nothing award winning. It's everything you would expect given the story it has to tell. Couple times it will make you cringe, but again, look what it needs to accomplish.\n\nThe late Jerry Goldsmith's score for this movie is a hands down classic. Only having two weeks to score the film after Peterson rejected Randy Newman's work, Goldsmith with the help of Joel Mcneely composed one of the most bombastic, riveting, emotional, suspenseful, and patriotic scores I've heard come out of the film world. It works perfectly with the movie.\n\nA few times your mind is going to be stretch you may have to resort to the "It's just a movie" mindset. Overall its fun. Not a bad way to spend 2 hours. Harrison Ford for President.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":187360,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-07-25","keywords":"airplane hijacking,terrorist,terrorism,vietnam war veteran,first lady of the united states of america","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3680287513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFkNzYyZjAtMzcxYy00ZTk3LWFiNjktYjgyZDZjMGUwYTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFkNzYyZjAtMzcxYy00ZTk3LWFiNjktYjgyZDZjMGUwYTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000335/","name":"Glenn Close"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000583/","name":"Wolfgang Petersen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064908/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005233/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

Thanks to 2 dimensional characters, an overdone plot, and poor use of foreshadowing, the entire film is predictable. At the same time it doesn't bother to show or explain how certain important plot devices came to be. The movie reeks from it's overuse of Deus ex machina.\n\nThe special effects were the only engaging thing about this movie. A lot of it felt like The Matrix in 3D.\n\nOne other thing this film did well was continuity from the 3rd film. I like that they didn't spend much time on flashbacks while being faithful to the events of the 3rd film.\n\nAll in all my feeling after seeing the movie was that I was expecting more. They could have made it longer, filled in some missing details, developed the plot/characters more, and had a much more enjoyable film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":166220,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Horror"],"datePublished":"2010-10-20","keywords":"siege,ship,alaska,female gunfighter,mutation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Resident Evil: Afterlife - International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi213583385","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk4MDE4NjY0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk4MDE4NjY0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a world ravaged by a virus infection, turning its victims into the Undead, Alice (Jovovich), continues on her journey to find survivors and lead them to safety.

Thanks to 2 dimensional characters, an overdone plot, and poor use of foreshadowing, the entire film is predictable. At the same time it doesn't bother to show or explain how certain important plot devices came to be. The movie reeks from it's overuse of Deus ex machina.\n\nThe special effects were the only engaging thing about this movie. A lot of it felt like The Matrix in 3D.\n\nOne other thing this film did well was continuity from the 3rd film. I like that they didn't spend much time on flashbacks while being faithful to the events of the 3rd film.\n\nAll in all my feeling after seeing the movie was that I was expecting more. They could have made it longer, filled in some missing details, developed the plot/characters more, and had a much more enjoyable film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":166220,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Horror"],"datePublished":"2010-10-20","keywords":"siege,ship,alaska,female gunfighter,mutation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Resident Evil: Afterlife - International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi213583385","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk4MDE4NjY0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk4MDE4NjY0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a world ravaged by a virus infection, turning its victims into the Undead, Alice (Jovovich), continues on her journey to find survivors and lead them to safety.

It's a wonderful Jackie Chan physical comedy combined with a really nice striptease from the super hot Indian actress. Sure to become a classic scene.\n\nThe rest of the movie constitutes of a historical "Hero" like war martial art action with some modern Jackie Chan slapstick. The plot is very tenuous and was probably written after someone wanted a story with Chinese history combined with a modern drive towards the nascent Chinese scientific and technological resurgence.\n\nJackie Chan plays an Indiana Jones like archaeologist which spirals into a Lara Croft style adventure of finding very strange but mindbogglingly powerful things. Meanwhile a very hazy parallel story runs of a concubine who falls for a general played by Jackie Chan a few hundreds years in the past. There is anti-gravity devices and immortality pills thrown in as well.\n\nThough it does get really cheesy and maudlin at times, it's a really fun movie to watch.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14989,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-03-29","keywords":"warrior,ancient china,reincarnation,hare krishna,time travel","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0788405/","name":"Bing Shao"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000329/","name":"Jackie Chan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2274407/","name":"Weixing Yao"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0867262/","name":"Stanley Tong"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0210533/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049799/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0867262/","name":"Stanley Tong"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1934885/","name":"Hai-shu Li"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's a wonderful Jackie Chan physical comedy combined with a really nice striptease from the super hot Indian actress. Sure to become a classic scene.\n\nThe rest of the movie constitutes of a historical "Hero" like war martial art action with some modern Jackie Chan slapstick. The plot is very tenuous and was probably written after someone wanted a story with Chinese history combined with a modern drive towards the nascent Chinese scientific and technological resurgence.\n\nJackie Chan plays an Indiana Jones like archaeologist which spirals into a Lara Croft style adventure of finding very strange but mindbogglingly powerful things. Meanwhile a very hazy parallel story runs of a concubine who falls for a general played by Jackie Chan a few hundreds years in the past. There is anti-gravity devices and immortality pills thrown in as well.\n\nThough it does get really cheesy and maudlin at times, it's a really fun movie to watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14989,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-03-29","keywords":"warrior,ancient china,reincarnation,hare krishna,time travel","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0788405/","name":"Bing Shao","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000329/","name":"Jackie Chan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2274407/","name":"Weixing Yao"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0867262/","name":"Stanley Tong"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0210533/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049799/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0867262/","name":"Stanley Tong","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1934885/","name":"Hai-shu Li"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.\n\nSam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.\n\nBriefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.\n\nThings go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.\n\nTobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.\n\nI have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":523471,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2007-05-01","keywords":"villain,peter parker character,alien parasite,alien symbiote,coffeeshop","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spider-Man 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi826343961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGYzNWJlMDEtM2MwOS00NTA3LThjMWItYmIzZjQ0MzI4MDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGYzNWJlMDEtM2MwOS00NTA3LThjMWItYmIzZjQ0MzI4MDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this third installment in the superhero film series"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001497/","name":"Tobey Maguire"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0333410/","name":"Topher Grace"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000600/","name":"Sam Raimi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000600/","name":"Sam Raimi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0706898/","name":"Ivan Raimi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765091/","name":"Alvin Sargent"}],"duration":"PT2H19M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.\n\nSam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.\n\nBriefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.\n\nThings go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.\n\nTobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.\n\nI have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":523471,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2007-05-01","keywords":"villain,peter parker character,alien parasite,alien symbiote,coffeeshop","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spider-Man 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi826343961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGYzNWJlMDEtM2MwOS00NTA3LThjMWItYmIzZjQ0MzI4MDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGYzNWJlMDEtM2MwOS00NTA3LThjMWItYmIzZjQ0MzI4MDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this third installment in the superhero film series","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001497/","name":"Tobey Maguire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0333410/","name":"Topher Grace"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000600/","name":"Sam Raimi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000600/","name":"Sam Raimi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0706898/","name":"Ivan Raimi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765091/","name":"Alvin Sargent"],"duration":"PT2H19M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sands is trying to control a coup by allowing it to happy but then having the victor killed as soon as he takes power.  However the involvement of drug lord Barillo and various other groups soon complicate matters causing bullets to come from all sides.\n\nAfter taking an unlikely trilogy to box office success, Rodriguez returns to the film series that basically brought him the success he has today  El Mariachi.  While the first film in the series was a very cheap movie, the second and the third swelled with budget and star names.  Here the action is constant and is very stylised.  This is not to say that it is all edge of the seat stuff, but if spectacle and bangs is all you are after then this should do the job nicely.

The other downside to this is that some characters are so poorly used that it's a wonder as to why they were even written in.  Some cameos are fantastic and make the film.  I refer to, of course, Depp, who, for the second time this summer, manages to make a film better by his sheer witty performance.  He owes a lot to the writing of the character but he carries him off superbly and is darkly funny.  However Rouke, Blades, Mendes, Dafoe all have little to do and, with some of them, are just clutter.  Banderas does his usual stuff with style but his character doesn't have the depth that the flashbacks I think are meant to give him  again this is style over substance.\n\nI still quite enjoyed the film but couldn't help but feel it was less the sum of it's parts.

It's not massively original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed, wouldn't they?), but "Dan In Real Life" is entertaining, and a good cast (who wouldn't fall in love at first sight with the luminous Juliette Binoche?) make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love.\n\nI hope that Steve Carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99884,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you cannot accept it, fear not, "Get Smart" will be along later in the year, but for the record I thought he was very good.\n\n"Dan In Real Life" starts off like your typical, incidentally amusing, family drama, but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and Carell's frustration with his situation grows. It's not massively original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed, wouldn't they?), but "Dan In Real Life" is entertaining, and a good cast (who wouldn't fall in love at first sight with the luminous Juliette Binoche?) make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love.\n\nI hope that Steve Carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99884,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.\n\nAt this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.\n\nThis is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.\n\nThese were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.\n\nSorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.\n\nMy rating: 10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1707683,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2004-02-11","keywords":"epic,orc,hobbit,ring,middle earth","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.\n\nAt this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.\n\nThis is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.\n\nThese were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.\n\nSorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.\n\nMy rating: 10/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1707683,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2004-02-11","keywords":"epic,orc,hobbit,ring,middle earth","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

It's one of the better German movies I've seen lately, certainly worth a watch if you like escape movies.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-09-27","keywords":"east germany,year 1979,berlin germany,1970s,based on true story","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1694023449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFmMGU3NTMtZjdkMC00ZjI5LWJmZTQtYWY4NGM2MTYwNmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFmMGU3NTMtZjdkMC00ZjI5LWJmZTQtYWY4NGM2MTYwNmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3177935/","name":"Friedrich Mücke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0775858/","name":"Karoline Schuch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1269088/","name":"David Kross"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378660/","name":"Michael Herbig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108386/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027692/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0394219/","name":"Kit Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0973731/","name":"Thilo Röscheisen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378660/","name":"Michael Herbig"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You've got one of the most beloved films in your entire catalogue; the first animated film ever that was nominated for a best picture Oscar - and you give the new version of that film to the director of 'Twilight' parts 3 and 4? Has anyone of your executives even seen Bill Condon's 'Twilight' films or did you just look at all the money they made during their opening weekend? Just so you know: those films are atrocious. There are porn films who look better and have better plots (seriously).\n\nNow the good news is, 'Beauty and the Beast' is nowhere near as bad as the Twilight films, but it DOES bear a striking visual resemblance to those teen shlock movies. And that's what I don't get: if you have the chance to make a film that will make 1.5 billion dollars (given the reviews are good) - wouldn't you want to make sure to make the best looking film possible?

Great actors like Kevin Kline are simply wasted because they have nothing to do besides just being there and have a certain look. The one actor who makes something of his role is, naturally, the one who plays the baddie; Luke Evans at least looks like he's having fun.\n\nBut all that is still not the worst. What sank the film for me was Beast. It's mind-boggling to me how a gigantic company like Disney lets a film open if the most important CGI effects obviously don't look convincing yet. Beast's face never looks real and that's just not acceptable. It's been almost 10 years since we got a completely convincing CGI "beast" face with Peter Jackson's King Kong, complete with alive looking eyes and natural facial expressions. Since then we got films like 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Jungle Book' that looked even better and more realistic. So what happened?

As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.\n\nSorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.\n\nMy rating: 10/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1707683,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2004-02-11","keywords":"epic,orc,hobbit,ring,middle earth","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

The big bad men are here and they don't care about hurting children. it's time to get nasty.\n\nGone is the frivolity of the first couple of movies where magic was cool and everything in this new and magical world was just wonderful to behold, a la World of Disney. The new director has taken some risks with style and approach and they've paid off brilliantly. Order of the Phoenix is probably the darkest of the five movies we've had so far, even more so than Azkhaban which was a step in the right direction for where the series would eventually be heading. There's very little "fun" in Phoenix and you can see why. The Dark Lord is back, it's no laughing matter and this movie actually sells that fact.\n\nThis (in the movie world at least) is where Harry Potter crosses the line from kids movie to grown ups movie.\n\nHarry now has some serious mental scars (as well as his actual one of course) since the events of the previous movie which while lighter than Azkhaban, followed on well from that movie. The Ministry of Magic is in denial about Voldermorts return and are trying to control the flow of rumour stemming from the events of Goblet. To this end we have new teacher and Ministry stooge Dolores Umbridge. Pink and fluffy on the outside, crunchy and evil on the inside. She makes no qualms about re-ordering the law at Hogwarts putting the kybosh on anything even remotely fun and making the students lives a complete misery. What she put Harry through in detention was simply pure evil.\n\nShe wasn't quite how I pictured her from the book but Imelda Staunton played her with a deliciously bitter/sweet twist, all charming and proper in her righteous delusions with that "stab you in the back" thing going on. She was a nasty piece of work.\n\nIt is a shame that a lot of the content of the book was missing but it was a big book and although I can't put my finger on what wasn't in the movie (I read it a while ago now) it does sometimes feel that there should have more substance to a few areas, mainly the characterisation of some of the characters. Most of the major bits I remember from the book were in the movie. There's a pace here we haven't seen before, a new musical approach also puts a new twist on things and I think Harry Potters world seems to fit it's new clothes well. I'm eagerly anticipating what's next as I hear David Yates is also directing the Half Blood Prince (last I heard anyway) and since that book has zombies in it I think the new dark style will suit it awesomely thank you very much.\n\nThe characters all look much older than they're supposed to be in Phoenix but it also kind of works in it's favour. They all look like they have a bit more history and life experience behind them, they're coping with stuff that will age any kid and it shows. That's also testament to the acting as well. Here mostly all the acting is pretty good, Ron Harry and Hermione all put in good efforts obviously having gotten the hang of the whole acting lark. Gambon is good as Dumbledore but I do miss Richard Harris and keep playing what might have been his versions of Gambons scenes over in my head. When I read the books it's Harris I'm picturing. Helena Bonham Carter gives a kooky insane kind of air to Bellatrix Lestrange (must get that from hubby Tim Burton) who was a pretty good character. One thing about this film though is that the actual Order of the Phoenix isn't in it all that much really. A flaw that wasn't in the book. The line about Snape being in the order, if you missed it you wouldn't even know he was in the order at all and a subsequent scene later on might seem confusing.\n\nKreacher was well done I though, coming across as a real miserable old bugger which was appropriate. The producers apparently weren't going to put him in the movie at all but JK Rowling said they'd be stuffing themselves up for the final movie if they did that.\n\nAll in all I think Phoenix is the best so far of the five movies, followed by Azkhaban, Goblet, then the other two in no particular order.\n\nNow I've just got hold of The Deathly Hallows and although it's quarter past five I'm off to bed so see you later....","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":534103,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2007-08-15","keywords":"friendship,argus filch character,abusive uncle,bullying,albus dumbledore character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192310553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Bros.

The producers apparently weren't going to put him in the movie at all but JK Rowling said they'd be stuffing themselves up for the final movie if they did that.\n\nAll in all I think Phoenix is the best so far of the five movies, followed by Azkhaban, Goblet, then the other two in no particular order.\n\nNow I've just got hold of The Deathly Hallows and although it's quarter past five I'm off to bed so see you later....","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":534103,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2007-08-15","keywords":"friendship,argus filch character,abusive uncle,bullying,albus dumbledore character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192310553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Bros.

One of the best fantasy films ever made","reviewBody":"I have always been a big fan of Harry Potter, both the books and the films. Half-Blood Prince is my favorite of the first 6 books, and now I can say that the film is as well. First off, the film does cut a lot of things out. It cuts some of the Horcruxes that are talked about, and some of the memories of Tom Riddle, but even without them, this is an incredibly powerful film. The opening sequence I loved and I was glad that the writers would include such a scene. It shows the danger of the world that everyone lives in now that Voldemort is back. David Yates is back directing the 6th film after the fantastic Order of the Phoenix, which I thought he created a much more moodier and grittier Harry Potter adaptation. In Half-Blood Prince, Yates directs with much larger confidence and maturity, one that is shown much throughout the film. This Potter film is the first to actually make me smile and laugh along with it. It has a lot of whimsical, light and genuinely funny moments, which I thought were brilliant and stayed true to the book. When the film requires it to, it gets darker and more menacing, which I also thought was balanced very nicely with the tone of the book. I like judging the Harry Poter films more as films, not always as adaptations. There will always be some people who are disappointed, but I am grateful for the things that were in the film, that they were well-made and stayed true to what I imagined while reading the book. This film succeeds in that. Steve Kloves is a very talented writer, to cut all those things out of the book but for it to stay with that same tone that J.K. Rowling marks on them.\n\nWhat helps this film are the performances to a great extent. The adult cast as always is great. Michael Gambon, Jim Broadbent, Alan Rickman, and Helena Bonham Carter all deliver high-worthy performances. They should all be considered for Oscar consideration come the end of the year. The young cast is brilliant. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have all grown very comfortably into their characters, and they know their strengths and weaknesses. Bonnie Wright also becomes more important in just the right time, since she is also very good as Ginny. Evanna Lynch is fantastic again like in the last film. The young kids playing Tom Riddle are spot-on. But the biggest surprise for me had to be Tom Felton. His character is more important here than in the other films, but Felton really was masterful. He portrays everything about Draco Malfoy that was intended by Rowling: his fear, his anger, his remorse. Malfoy is in a very dark place, and Felton goes up and beyond what I would have expected from him. The strongest of the young cast.\n\nThe other aspects of what make this film brilliant are the technical aspects of course. The cinematography must be what is most amazing. It is so well-done, captures every shot right and with powerful meaning behind it. The different color textures and lighting really are beautiful. Also, Some truly amazing shots in this film. Like always, the set designs are wonderful. The visual effects are strong, but not to a point that they detract from the film. If the Academy does not recognize at least the technical side, then what can they recognize?\n\nOverall, I simply loved Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Yes, the ending was shorter here than in the book, but I thought it still worked well, and certainly not anti-climactic. The death was very well done, and I thought was handled better than in Order of the Phoenix (while still a great film, lacked the emotion for Sirius dying). The ending was perfect, left me feeling sad and happy at the same time, and cannot wait for Deathly Hallows!

After the emotionally charged story, and particularly the climax, of "Casino Royale", the bar was set very high for the follow-up.\n\nDoes "Quantum of Solace" deliver? Well, honestly, the answer to that depends almost entirely on what you were expecting. If you were expecting a lengthy, down-to-earth, 'realistic' ('plausible' is probably a better description for "Casino Royale") character-based revenge flick, "Quantum of Solace" is not it. What "Quantum of Solace" does is weave the characterization into the plot and action to the point where we don't have room to breathe. The criticisms against the movie for lacking in character development are downright absurd- it's all there, the movie just doesn't stop and explicitly tell you what it's doing. If you're paying attention to what Bond's doing throughout the film surely you will understand why he is motivated to do those things. It's pretty careful and refined writing from Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (with the addition of script polisher/editor Paul Haggis). \n\nWhat "Quantum of Solace" doesn't do is deliver a repeat of "Casino Royale". I'm actually quite amazed at the venomous reaction to the film by fans who seem to adore the more humorous, faster-moving Bond films. I mean, this isn't exactly right up their alley, but it's sure as hell not as drawn-out and slow-moving (although I didn't feel that was a bad thing in CR's case) as "Casino Royale", it surely doesn't spend most of its time on the dialogue and characterization, and it surely isn't as significantly divergent from the Bond formula as that film was. This is, ultimately, not unlike several Bond films we've seen before. There's snarling foreign villains with accents, a shadowy evil organization with political motivations, there's plenty, plenty of action. The "Bourne" comparisons are especially confounding. So, because Robert Ludlum once took from the Bond character and stories to write his "Bourne" novels, the Bond film series can't go back to Bond's roots in Fleming's great novels for inspiration? I'd say that "Quantum" has more in common with Bond films of the past than any of the Bourne films. If they're talking about the action scenes here, then while they lack the coherence of some of the greatest action scenes in Bond history, they are still much easier to follow than anything in Greengrass' "Bourne" films. Outside the first 15 minutes there's barely anything here that resembles a Bourne film at all, actually. The first two action scenes- the car chase and foot chase- are over-edited for sure, but the rest of the action scenes are grand, particularly the plane scene and climactic action scene at the hotel. \n\nThe technical aspects of the film are all good, director Marc Forster doesn't mess up (which, given the quality of many of his previous films, was perhaps the greatest danger this Bond installment faced) the David Arnold score is not one of the great Bond scores, and his (or the producers') refusal to use an orchestral version of the score much during the actual film is quite frustrating, but it's quite good and certainly not among the worst scores the series has had. Craig is an absolutely superb Bond, Olga Kurylenko is a find Bond girl and fairly well-developed but not at the expense of Bond or the story, while Gemma Arterton's limited screen time is an unnecessary diversion. Arterton's not the only flaw here, the design is a bit naff at times, and there's several things that could have been done better, especially during the first 15 minutes, but the movie works as a whole, and it's not nearly as humorless as some are suggesting; there's some genuinely funny stuff here, without descending into over-the-top camp.

After the emotionally charged story, and particularly the climax, of "Casino Royale", the bar was set very high for the follow-up.\n\nDoes "Quantum of Solace" deliver? Well, honestly, the answer to that depends almost entirely on what you were expecting. If you were expecting a lengthy, down-to-earth, 'realistic' ('plausible' is probably a better description for "Casino Royale") character-based revenge flick, "Quantum of Solace" is not it. What "Quantum of Solace" does is weave the characterization into the plot and action to the point where we don't have room to breathe. The criticisms against the movie for lacking in character development are downright absurd- it's all there, the movie just doesn't stop and explicitly tell you what it's doing. If you're paying attention to what Bond's doing throughout the film surely you will understand why he is motivated to do those things. It's pretty careful and refined writing from Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (with the addition of script polisher/editor Paul Haggis). \n\nWhat "Quantum of Solace" doesn't do is deliver a repeat of "Casino Royale". I'm actually quite amazed at the venomous reaction to the film by fans who seem to adore the more humorous, faster-moving Bond films. I mean, this isn't exactly right up their alley, but it's sure as hell not as drawn-out and slow-moving (although I didn't feel that was a bad thing in CR's case) as "Casino Royale", it surely doesn't spend most of its time on the dialogue and characterization, and it surely isn't as significantly divergent from the Bond formula as that film was. This is, ultimately, not unlike several Bond films we've seen before. There's snarling foreign villains with accents, a shadowy evil organization with political motivations, there's plenty, plenty of action. The "Bourne" comparisons are especially confounding. So, because Robert Ludlum once took from the Bond character and stories to write his "Bourne" novels, the Bond film series can't go back to Bond's roots in Fleming's great novels for inspiration? I'd say that "Quantum" has more in common with Bond films of the past than any of the Bourne films. If they're talking about the action scenes here, then while they lack the coherence of some of the greatest action scenes in Bond history, they are still much easier to follow than anything in Greengrass' "Bourne" films. Outside the first 15 minutes there's barely anything here that resembles a Bourne film at all, actually. The first two action scenes- the car chase and foot chase- are over-edited for sure, but the rest of the action scenes are grand, particularly the plane scene and climactic action scene at the hotel. \n\nThe technical aspects of the film are all good, director Marc Forster doesn't mess up (which, given the quality of many of his previous films, was perhaps the greatest danger this Bond installment faced) the David Arnold score is not one of the great Bond scores, and his (or the producers') refusal to use an orchestral version of the score much during the actual film is quite frustrating, but it's quite good and certainly not among the worst scores the series has had. Craig is an absolutely superb Bond, Olga Kurylenko is a find Bond girl and fairly well-developed but not at the expense of Bond or the story, while Gemma Arterton's limited screen time is an unnecessary diversion. Arterton's not the only flaw here, the design is a bit naff at times, and there's several things that could have been done better, especially during the first 15 minutes, but the movie works as a whole, and it's not nearly as humorless as some are suggesting; there's some genuinely funny stuff here, without descending into over-the-top camp. Actually, "Quantum of Solace" sees a welcome return of a deadpan delivery to the one-liners which evokes Connery's best moments. No winking at the camera, no raised eyebrows, just the jokes. Felix grabbing a beer and looking nonchalant as the SWAT team tried and failed to capture Bond, Bond stealing the bike from under the informant ("I missed!"), Bond and M at the hotel...

I won't go too in depth into the differences between the book and the movie. Some characters were cut, some stories were shortened and rearranged, and the ending is somewhat less dark. However, I would say that all of these changes are understandable when making a two hour movie. The soul of the book is still there though. If you liked the book, you will like the movie. The directing and acting are great, and I have zero complaints in this department.\n\nI do have a few complaints, starting with some parts of the plot seem like they would be hard to follow if you haven't read the book. There were segments of the story that would have benefited from a little more time spent on them for clarity. I am a fan of long movies, and understand that a lot of people are not, but I think an extra 15 minutes could have made a big difference.\n\nThe narration seems to be a sore subject among the other reviews I've read, and I have to say I have mixed feelings. I like the idea of narration in a book-turned-movie. There's a certain amount of context and motive behind characters' actions that can get glossed over in a movie if there's no narration, but it was too inconsistent in this case. It either needed more narration, or it needed to be limited to just the intro and outro.\n\nI think the major issue with the movie is that people are focusing on the wrong parts of it. Everyone wants to talk about the blunt sexual content, and the excessive use of technology in the movie. To me, those are the things that make it a realistic story. Perhaps that's just because I'm in my twenties, and blunt sexual content and excessive technology use are a large percentage of my life. People call this a movie about how technology is ruining and/or changing relationships. I disagree. This movie is about growing up, relationships, and miscommunication. Affairs aren't new. Questionable parenting isn't new. Body image issues aren't new. Sexual frustration isn't new. Depression isn't new. The movie shows technology not as a cause or effect of any of these things, but as being intertwined with them the exact way technology is intertwined with modern life. People are looking to MWC as a comment on technology in modern life, and finding it wishy- washy. But that's because it's not taking any sides, it's just showing how things are.\n\nIf you go in to this movie expecting an interesting story, rather than an editorial about technology, you'll probably enjoy it. Just don't bring your kids or your parents.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31585,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-10-17","keywords":"sex scene,oral sex,black panties,masturbation,teenage girl","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2494279449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0ODkxMDI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDczOTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0ODkxMDI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDczOTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Men, Women and Children follows the story of a group of high school teenagers and their parents as they attempt to navigate the many ways the internet has changed their relationships, their communication, their self-image, and their love lives.

I won't go too in depth into the differences between the book and the movie. Some characters were cut, some stories were shortened and rearranged, and the ending is somewhat less dark. However, I would say that all of these changes are understandable when making a two hour movie. The soul of the book is still there though. If you liked the book, you will like the movie. The directing and acting are great, and I have zero complaints in this department.\n\nI do have a few complaints, starting with some parts of the plot seem like they would be hard to follow if you haven't read the book. There were segments of the story that would have benefited from a little more time spent on them for clarity. I am a fan of long movies, and understand that a lot of people are not, but I think an extra 15 minutes could have made a big difference.\n\nThe narration seems to be a sore subject among the other reviews I've read, and I have to say I have mixed feelings. I like the idea of narration in a book-turned-movie. There's a certain amount of context and motive behind characters' actions that can get glossed over in a movie if there's no narration, but it was too inconsistent in this case. It either needed more narration, or it needed to be limited to just the intro and outro.\n\nI think the major issue with the movie is that people are focusing on the wrong parts of it. Everyone wants to talk about the blunt sexual content, and the excessive use of technology in the movie. To me, those are the things that make it a realistic story. Perhaps that's just because I'm in my twenties, and blunt sexual content and excessive technology use are a large percentage of my life. People call this a movie about how technology is ruining and/or changing relationships. I disagree. This movie is about growing up, relationships, and miscommunication. Affairs aren't new. Questionable parenting isn't new. Body image issues aren't new. Sexual frustration isn't new. Depression isn't new. The movie shows technology not as a cause or effect of any of these things, but as being intertwined with them the exact way technology is intertwined with modern life. People are looking to MWC as a comment on technology in modern life, and finding it wishy- washy. But that's because it's not taking any sides, it's just showing how things are.\n\nIf you go in to this movie expecting an interesting story, rather than an editorial about technology, you'll probably enjoy it. Just don't bring your kids or your parents.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31585,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-10-17","keywords":"sex scene,oral sex,black panties,masturbation,teenage girl","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2494279449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0ODkxMDI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDczOTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0ODkxMDI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDczOTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Men, Women and Children follows the story of a group of high school teenagers and their parents as they attempt to navigate the many ways the internet has changed their relationships, their communication, their self-image, and their love lives. The film attempts to stare down social issues such as video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the proliferation of illicit material on the internet. As each character and each relationship is tested, we are shown the variety of roads people choose - some tragic, some hopeful - as it becomes clear that no one is immune to this enormous social change that has come through our phones, our tablets, and our computers.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3239803/","name":"Kaitlyn Dever","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1679669/","name":"Rosemarie DeWitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5052065/","name":"Ansel Elgort"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718646/","name":"Jason Reitman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0280848/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2226753/","name":"Chad Kultgen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718646/","name":"Jason Reitman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933379/","name":"Erin Cressida Wilson"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There was also the interest to see how Lady Gaga would fare in her acting debut and how Bradley Cooper would fare as first-time director. Decided to see it when taking a break from practise with nothing else better to do, going in with very high expectations, as part of my "seeing as many 2018 films as possible" quest.\n\nThis is not the only, or first, 'A Star is Born' film. There is one from 1937 with Mitzi Gaynor and Fredric March, my personal favourite. There is one from 1954, the most famous, which is overlong but does contain Judy Garland's best ever performance and terrific songs (especially the heart-wrenching "The Man That Got Away"), love James Mason in it too. There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and "Evergreen" is to die for.\n\nAs far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.\n\nIt's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.\n\nThe final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.\n\nWhat 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.\n\nVisually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as "The Man That Got Away" and "Evergreen" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. "I'll Never Love Again" and "Shallow" stand out.\n\nDialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.\n\nAltogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":355027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-05","keywords":"alcoholism,tinnitus,rising star,singer songwriter,singer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi94288665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","description":"A movie star helps a young singer and actress find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605792/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744839/","name":"Eric Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3391497/","name":"Will Fetters"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Didn't expected much cause I really liked 94 version by Gillian Armstrong with Winona Ryder , Gabriel Byrne , Trini Alvarado , Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon. Well, the casting was something that I cannot judge which one is better. Both are so so great. But Christian Bale 94, I liked better than Timothée Chalamet 2019 (Although he was good but didn't overcome THE Christian).\n\nTwo things really grabbed me.\n\n1. The camera and light. The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make. They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice. Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.\n\n2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music. In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie &amp; Julia and Philomena.\n\nI cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.\n\nAlso the acting sometimes made my heart beat. Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?\n\nLast. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.) Something that was different with the 94 version.\n\nIt is an inspiring movie after all and I won't rest tonight to finish my humble feature writing for my next project.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164531,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-25","keywords":"aspiring writer,poverty,women's rights,mother daughter relationship,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2655304729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer-director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) has crafted a Little Women that draws on both the classic novel and the writings of Louisa May Alcott, and unfolds as the author’s alter ego, Jo March, reflects back and forth on her fictional life."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519680/","name":"Saoirse Ronan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6073955/","name":"Florence Pugh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0532247/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017301/","name":"Louisa May Alcott"}],"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A lot of people have been lamenting the "frame story" this movie adds in, as well as the idea of making the Once-ler a human character. As far as the frame goes, it's done pretty well. It's a bit flat but perfectly enjoyable for younger kids. Making the Once-ler human, though? BRILLIANT. Hear me out. The original Once-ler was a faceless force of destruction, a shadowy embodiment of greed. This Once-ler is just a stupid kid with a dream, a guy who wants to change the world. He's not evil, but he lets his success get to his head, and that brings about his own downfall and the destruction of the forest. That's FANTASTIC, and here's why: that's how the world really is! Companies don't sit around all day cackling about how much smog they're pumping into the atmosphere; it's a process, and something that happened gradually. Obliviousness is just as dangerous as maliciousness, and that's a really powerful lesson. This can happen to YOU if you're not careful; anybody can hurt the planet if they don't pay attention. That's a rare lesson, and one I'm really pleased to see in this movie. \n\nSo, is it silly and stupid sometimes? Yes, of course. But it's colorful and exuberant, and in a lot of ways I think it really captured the "Seuss-ness" that similar remakes have missed. There's nothing offensive about it (besides the miserable marketing) and my little brother enjoyed it as a fun movie. I enjoyed it for giving us a deeper--and in my opinion, very powerful--character type: the accidental villain, the everydude who makes a horrible mistake that the environment suffers for. So take that as you will...but overall, I found myself liking this a lot more than I expected. Definitely worth a watch.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104240,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-03-14","keywords":"corrupt mayor,crooked mayor,heroine,betrayal,cat","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1238212889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMzY0MDY3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY3NzYzNw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMzY0MDY3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY3NzYzNw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A 12-year-old boy searches for the one thing that will enable him to win the affection of the girl of his dreams.

A lot of people have been lamenting the "frame story" this movie adds in, as well as the idea of making the Once-ler a human character. As far as the frame goes, it's done pretty well. It's a bit flat but perfectly enjoyable for younger kids. Making the Once-ler human, though? BRILLIANT. Hear me out. The original Once-ler was a faceless force of destruction, a shadowy embodiment of greed. This Once-ler is just a stupid kid with a dream, a guy who wants to change the world. He's not evil, but he lets his success get to his head, and that brings about his own downfall and the destruction of the forest. That's FANTASTIC, and here's why: that's how the world really is! Companies don't sit around all day cackling about how much smog they're pumping into the atmosphere; it's a process, and something that happened gradually. Obliviousness is just as dangerous as maliciousness, and that's a really powerful lesson. This can happen to YOU if you're not careful; anybody can hurt the planet if they don't pay attention. That's a rare lesson, and one I'm really pleased to see in this movie. \n\nSo, is it silly and stupid sometimes? Yes, of course. But it's colorful and exuberant, and in a lot of ways I think it really captured the "Seuss-ness" that similar remakes have missed. There's nothing offensive about it (besides the miserable marketing) and my little brother enjoyed it as a fun movie. I enjoyed it for giving us a deeper--and in my opinion, very powerful--character type: the accidental villain, the everydude who makes a horrible mistake that the environment suffers for. So take that as you will...but overall, I found myself liking this a lot more than I expected. Definitely worth a watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104240,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-03-14","keywords":"corrupt mayor,crooked mayor,heroine,betrayal,cat","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1238212889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMzY0MDY3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY3NzYzNw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMzY0MDY3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY3NzYzNw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A 12-year-old boy searches for the one thing that will enable him to win the affection of the girl of his dreams.

And of course cue the blood card. It's laid out all on here. Well at least the tree rape was a solid homage, but I still prefer the original's.\n\nAll in all, "Evil Dead" can't be described as "awful", "insulting", or a bad remake. It can be described as "not scary", "average", or really both of those things. With so much hype, and Raimi/Campbell behind this, AND with all the rave reviews from screenings, this is not the movie the fans got. Maybe an unrated version down the road will bump up a few points but for now, a 5 is satisfactory.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":162373,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2013-04-17","keywords":"demon,forest,zombie,fear,nurse","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2732631577","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjY4NDkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExODMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjY4NDkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExODMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Five friends head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of a Book of the Dead leads them to unwittingly summon up demons living in the nearby woods.

And with that being said, it cuts into 1/3 of the movie.\n\nThe most-raved about opening sequence is nothing more than a disappointment. Cue the foul language. Cue every cliché in filmmaking history. And of course cue the blood card. It's laid out all on here. Well at least the tree rape was a solid homage, but I still prefer the original's.\n\nAll in all, "Evil Dead" can't be described as "awful", "insulting", or a bad remake. It can be described as "not scary", "average", or really both of those things. With so much hype, and Raimi/Campbell behind this, AND with all the rave reviews from screenings, this is not the movie the fans got. Maybe an unrated version down the road will bump up a few points but for now, a 5 is satisfactory.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":162373,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2013-04-17","keywords":"demon,forest,zombie,fear,nurse","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2732631577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjY4NDkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExODMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjY4NDkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExODMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Five friends head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of a Book of the Dead leads them to unwittingly summon up demons living in the nearby woods.

If you want mindless techno-babble, then this show isn't for you. 2. If you don't manage to appreciate what good... no, let me rephrase that for you: exquisite acting is, then you definitely shouldn't watch it. 3. If you expect to have a crew of four, including a science doctor, an alien, a military and some random Indiana Jones guy, all of them solving new let's-save-the-Earth-before-lunch problems, then skip BSG, is not for you. 4. If you're afraid of seeing real human stories put into a SF shell, perhaps you should go back to Star Trek (and I'm a trekkie too, but...) 5. If you crave to hear 'shields up' or 'engage' or other classic one- liners, then you should rather settle for "frak". Or is it "frakk"? 6. If you're unable to follow a 4 season-long story arc with every episode adding something precious to it without having withdrawal symptoms, then you should really don't give it a try. 7. If all that you want is see people in tight suits flashing laser pistols and teleporting from harms' way, then change the channel. 8. If your interest for spiritual quests, tough sexy girls and people really dying and not returning is something like zero. Oh well, you might skip that 'dying and not returning part' :P 9.

If you want mindless techno-babble, then this show isn't for you. 2. If you don't manage to appreciate what good... no, let me rephrase that for you: exquisite acting is, then you definitely shouldn't watch it. 3. If you expect to have a crew of four, including a science doctor, an alien, a military and some random Indiana Jones guy, all of them solving new let's-save-the-Earth-before-lunch problems, then skip BSG, is not for you. 4. If you're afraid of seeing real human stories put into a SF shell, perhaps you should go back to Star Trek (and I'm a trekkie too, but...) 5. If you crave to hear 'shields up' or 'engage' or other classic one- liners, then you should rather settle for "frak". Or is it "frakk"? 6. If you're unable to follow a 4 season-long story arc with every episode adding something precious to it without having withdrawal symptoms, then you should really don't give it a try. 7. If all that you want is see people in tight suits flashing laser pistols and teleporting from harms' way, then change the channel. 8. If your interest for spiritual quests, tough sexy girls and people really dying and not returning is something like zero. Oh well, you might skip that 'dying and not returning part' :P 9. If you don't like space battles rendered so real (and with as most care for real physics as a TV SF show can take) that you feel you ARE there. 10. Finally, if you have a mind so closed that you cannot appreciate what the best SF show ever made is all about. \n\nIn my opinion, any problem that somebody would have with this show would be his/her problem, not the shows.

He has created some of the most fascinating creatures that traditional Hollywood doesn't have the guts or inclination to ever assemble. I would take Guillmero Del Torro in the director's chair any time any place, but Hellboy II shows that he is not without his flaws. Ron Perlman who is terrific as Hellboy doesn't have anything truly interesting to say or do, the world around him is magical but the plot isn't.\n\nHellboy is the most unique character to appear in your comic book shop. The mythology and the character are such the opposite of the main stream and to Hellboy II's credit so is this movie. Ron Perlman doesn't deliver catch phrases or gun down bad guys for the sake of doing so. He is an interesting character but he is overshadowed by this lackluster plot and the world around it. I felt as if we didn't see enough of Big Red or maybe we did we just didn't get to see the most of the talents. Del Torro constantly wants to remind you that he directed Pan's Labyrinth because visually the creatures look like they were leftovers from that film. I don't mind this per say but these characters just don't have much to do, they are there really to look at rather than them having significance. Visually I can't complain about them because they are amazing but they serve little purpose to the story.\n\nThe plot is really the weakest thing this movie has going for it. I felt it took too many liberties against the original concepts of Hellboy. Hellboy is a creature alive in our world, Del Torro tries to tell us that our world is nothing more than a division of fantasy and reality. Well we spend too much time in the fantasy that we forget the fact that this Golden Army is a threat to reality. The villain Prince Nuada is weak, we don't see any method to his madness other than the fact that the plot dictates that he be the antagonist. In the first film and to a lesser degree this one we were given details about why Hellboy has faith in humanity and would chose not to serve his purpose. It's interesting because we are given glimpses of what could have been something that could have added real teeth and tension to the story, for the first time Hellboy is tempted by evil, weakly tempted but tempted nonetheless. This mental struggle could have given our actors the chance to show their talent but instead the filler between the action scenes is just okay at best.\n\nI didn't hate Hellboy II I just think it needed some beef in it's story. Del Torro has shown us he is a master storyteller but this time he didn't focus on the story it's self. I would recommend this film but I know Del Torro can and has done much better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262248,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-10-08","keywords":"superhero,twins,friendship,cat,elf","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. teaser trailer: Hellboy II: The Golden Army","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1588723993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg","description":"This is a teaser trailer for Hellboy II: The Golden Army, directed by Guillermo del Toro"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004757/","name":"Selma Blair"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427964/","name":"Doug Jones"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020061/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239918/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586005/","name":"Mike Mignola"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He has created some of the most fascinating creatures that traditional Hollywood doesn't have the guts or inclination to ever assemble. I would take Guillmero Del Torro in the director's chair any time any place, but Hellboy II shows that he is not without his flaws. Ron Perlman who is terrific as Hellboy doesn't have anything truly interesting to say or do, the world around him is magical but the plot isn't.\n\nHellboy is the most unique character to appear in your comic book shop. The mythology and the character are such the opposite of the main stream and to Hellboy II's credit so is this movie. Ron Perlman doesn't deliver catch phrases or gun down bad guys for the sake of doing so. He is an interesting character but he is overshadowed by this lackluster plot and the world around it. I felt as if we didn't see enough of Big Red or maybe we did we just didn't get to see the most of the talents. Del Torro constantly wants to remind you that he directed Pan's Labyrinth because visually the creatures look like they were leftovers from that film. I don't mind this per say but these characters just don't have much to do, they are there really to look at rather than them having significance. Visually I can't complain about them because they are amazing but they serve little purpose to the story.\n\nThe plot is really the weakest thing this movie has going for it. I felt it took too many liberties against the original concepts of Hellboy. Hellboy is a creature alive in our world, Del Torro tries to tell us that our world is nothing more than a division of fantasy and reality. Well we spend too much time in the fantasy that we forget the fact that this Golden Army is a threat to reality. The villain Prince Nuada is weak, we don't see any method to his madness other than the fact that the plot dictates that he be the antagonist. In the first film and to a lesser degree this one we were given details about why Hellboy has faith in humanity and would chose not to serve his purpose.

It is also a little bit like Fringe. However there is no time travel or alternative universes in this yet. But I can see how i like it based on these two TV shows; there is a lot going on and you want to keep watching to see what happens. Acting may be a little mechanical and not as much depth to some characters that I would like but it looks good and is an interesting weird idea. I hope they do more Seasons and hope it maintains its good level.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":516,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"genre":["Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-03-05","keywords":"drug","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3065809/","name":"Rosabell Laurenti Sellers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0636440/","name":"Désirée Nosbusch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1571804/","name":"Falk Hentschel"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0783904/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314952/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0683188/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0559668/","name":"Rainer Matsutani"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He has created some of the most fascinating creatures that traditional Hollywood doesn't have the guts or inclination to ever assemble. I would take Guillmero Del Torro in the director's chair any time any place, but Hellboy II shows that he is not without his flaws. Ron Perlman who is terrific as Hellboy doesn't have anything truly interesting to say or do, the world around him is magical but the plot isn't.\n\nHellboy is the most unique character to appear in your comic book shop. The mythology and the character are such the opposite of the main stream and to Hellboy II's credit so is this movie. Ron Perlman doesn't deliver catch phrases or gun down bad guys for the sake of doing so. He is an interesting character but he is overshadowed by this lackluster plot and the world around it. I felt as if we didn't see enough of Big Red or maybe we did we just didn't get to see the most of the talents. Del Torro constantly wants to remind you that he directed Pan's Labyrinth because visually the creatures look like they were leftovers from that film. I don't mind this per say but these characters just don't have much to do, they are there really to look at rather than them having significance. Visually I can't complain about them because they are amazing but they serve little purpose to the story.\n\nThe plot is really the weakest thing this movie has going for it. I felt it took too many liberties against the original concepts of Hellboy. Hellboy is a creature alive in our world, Del Torro tries to tell us that our world is nothing more than a division of fantasy and reality. Well we spend too much time in the fantasy that we forget the fact that this Golden Army is a threat to reality. The villain Prince Nuada is weak, we don't see any method to his madness other than the fact that the plot dictates that he be the antagonist. In the first film and to a lesser degree this one we were given details about why Hellboy has faith in humanity and would chose not to serve his purpose. It's interesting because we are given glimpses of what could have been something that could have added real teeth and tension to the story, for the first time Hellboy is tempted by evil, weakly tempted but tempted nonetheless. This mental struggle could have given our actors the chance to show their talent but instead the filler between the action scenes is just okay at best.\n\nI didn't hate Hellboy II I just think it needed some beef in it's story. Del Torro has shown us he is a master storyteller but this time he didn't focus on the story it's self. I would recommend this film but I know Del Torro can and has done much better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262248,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-10-08","keywords":"superhero,twins,friendship,cat,elf","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. teaser trailer: Hellboy II: The Golden Army","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1588723993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg","description":"This is a teaser trailer for Hellboy II: The Golden Army, directed by Guillermo del Toro"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004757/","name":"Selma Blair"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427964/","name":"Doug Jones"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020061/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239918/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586005/","name":"Mike Mignola"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Del Torro has shown us he is a master storyteller but this time he didn't focus on the story it's self. I would recommend this film but I know Del Torro can and has done much better.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262248,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-10-08","keywords":"superhero,twins,friendship,cat,elf","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. teaser trailer: Hellboy II: The Golden Army","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1588723993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg","description":"This is a teaser trailer for Hellboy II: The Golden Army, directed by Guillermo del Toro","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004757/","name":"Selma Blair","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427964/","name":"Doug Jones"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020061/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239918/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586005/","name":"Mike Mignola"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.\n\nOne issue I had with Lee's 2003 film was the slow-pacing; the film felt as if it dragged forever between action scenes. It wasn't necessarily the fault of the cast, but seemed more to do with a story that didn't really grab me. Letterier's film amps up the excitement and interest levels a bit with a stronger story and better action sequences. The Hulk's fight against three gamma-irradiated dogs in the previous film doesn't even compare to the Hulk's battle against the Army on the college campus in this film. I didn't see the Hulk from 2003 as being overly-cartoonish in appearance but I can see how some others did. The new film gives the Hulk a grittier, stronger, more realistic style (as realistic as a 9-foot tall green giant can be) and the Abomination looks just as good.\n\nIn general, I also dug the new cast better than the previous. Ed Norton was great as Bruce Banner, giving him a great blend of meekness and inner strength. From what I understand, Norton is a huge fan of the source material so you know he must've given this role everything he had. I enjoyed Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, though there were times when I missed Jennifer Connelly, and Tim Roth has long been one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him go with the villainous side this time around as Blonsky. William Hurt was a fine General Ross though, just as Liv Tyler, there were times when I thought Sam Elliot would've put in a stronger performance (plus, there were a handful of instances where Hurt came off as over-acting a bit, in my opinion...).\n\nIt's great to have the character of the Hulk back in the hands of Marvel and they've done a great job of rejuvenating the franchise. I loved this film and, while it wasn't on par with 2008's Iron Man film, it was a great superhero flick. The action was brutal, the story was entertaining, and the cast was near perfect. My only real issue with the film was the ending; without going into detail, I thought the resolution of the final battle between the Hulk and Abomination was anti-climactic. I remember first watching the scene and the only thought that popped into my head was "That's IT?!".

He has created some of the most fascinating creatures that traditional Hollywood doesn't have the guts or inclination to ever assemble. I would take Guillmero Del Torro in the director's chair any time any place, but Hellboy II shows that he is not without his flaws. Ron Perlman who is terrific as Hellboy doesn't have anything truly interesting to say or do, the world around him is magical but the plot isn't.\n\nHellboy is the most unique character to appear in your comic book shop. The mythology and the character are such the opposite of the main stream and to Hellboy II's credit so is this movie. Ron Perlman doesn't deliver catch phrases or gun down bad guys for the sake of doing so. He is an interesting character but he is overshadowed by this lackluster plot and the world around it. I felt as if we didn't see enough of Big Red or maybe we did we just didn't get to see the most of the talents. Del Torro constantly wants to remind you that he directed Pan's Labyrinth because visually the creatures look like they were leftovers from that film. I don't mind this per say but these characters just don't have much to do, they are there really to look at rather than them having significance. Visually I can't complain about them because they are amazing but they serve little purpose to the story.\n\nThe plot is really the weakest thing this movie has going for it. I felt it took too many liberties against the original concepts of Hellboy. Hellboy is a creature alive in our world, Del Torro tries to tell us that our world is nothing more than a division of fantasy and reality. Well we spend too much time in the fantasy that we forget the fact that this Golden Army is a threat to reality. The villain Prince Nuada is weak, we don't see any method to his madness other than the fact that the plot dictates that he be the antagonist. In the first film and to a lesser degree this one we were given details about why Hellboy has faith in humanity and would chose not to serve his purpose. It's interesting because we are given glimpses of what could have been something that could have added real teeth and tension to the story, for the first time Hellboy is tempted by evil, weakly tempted but tempted nonetheless. This mental struggle could have given our actors the chance to show their talent but instead the filler between the action scenes is just okay at best.\n\nI didn't hate Hellboy II I just think it needed some beef in it's story. Del Torro has shown us he is a master storyteller but this time he didn't focus on the story it's self. I would recommend this film but I know Del Torro can and has done much better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262248,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-10-08","keywords":"superhero,twins,friendship,cat,elf","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. teaser trailer: Hellboy II: The Golden Army","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1588723993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg","description":"This is a teaser trailer for Hellboy II: The Golden Army, directed by Guillermo del Toro"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004757/","name":"Selma Blair"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427964/","name":"Doug Jones"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020061/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239918/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586005/","name":"Mike Mignola"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>
