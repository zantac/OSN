I love character-driven drama, and this film succeeds in creating indelible portraits. Even the social worker is quirky and memorable instead of just furthering the plot and being patently sympathetic.\n\nI could write quite a lot about Blethyn's riveting performance. How drained she must have been after sustaining a character who seems always at the height of emotional pressure.  Opposite her, Jean-Baptiste seemed as cool and smooth as could be. The contrasts created by these personae even extended to costume and decor.\n\nI decided to watch this movie again because after a BBC Shakespeare binge I wanted to see everything Ron Cook has been in.  And while the Stuart scene is really somewhat incongruous to the rest of the family plot, Cook's scene as the bitter, drunk 't****r' works for me perfectly.  So do the scenes of photo sessions -- and it's a matter of observing this film in terms of clarity of personal vision.  The occupations of photographer and optometrist seem to lend metaphors of spirituality -- for Maurice, the ability to see people as they are, and for Hortense, the ability to understand how others see the world. The wall of smoke that Cynthia and Roxanne seem to keep in front of them.  The disparity between the images created for the formal portraits and the truth of the personalities in them.

I love character-driven drama, and this film succeeds in creating indelible portraits. Even the social worker is quirky and memorable instead of just furthering the plot and being patently sympathetic.\n\nI could write quite a lot about Blethyn's riveting performance. How drained she must have been after sustaining a character who seems always at the height of emotional pressure.  Opposite her, Jean-Baptiste seemed as cool and smooth as could be. The contrasts created by these personae even extended to costume and decor.\n\nI decided to watch this movie again because after a BBC Shakespeare binge I wanted to see everything Ron Cook has been in.  And while the Stuart scene is really somewhat incongruous to the rest of the family plot, Cook's scene as the bitter, drunk 't****r' works for me perfectly.  So do the scenes of photo sessions -- and it's a matter of observing this film in terms of clarity of personal vision.  The occupations of photographer and optometrist seem to lend metaphors of spirituality -- for Maurice, the ability to see people as they are, and for Hortense, the ability to understand how others see the world. The wall of smoke that Cynthia and Roxanne seem to keep in front of them.  The disparity between the images created for the formal portraits and the truth of the personalities in them.  In a distinctly un-sappy way, Leigh has explored the old adage that "the truth will set you free."\n\nIf one reads a paragraph describing the main plot -- the adopted child seeking out her birth mother -- a very clear idea of a movie-of-the-week story comes to mind. 'Secrets and Lies' is nothing like that, and shows a mastery of vision and a cast of great talent.

The score was outstanding, the theme beautifully matching the opening to the film. Pity there wasn't more of it. Sean Bean, to those used to his villainous work in "Patriot Games", and "Goldeneye", was a little weak, but due to writing, not his thespian skills. And what's a Micheal Bay or Cohen Brothers movie without Steve Buscemi? His character was relatively weak, with no real motivation behind his actions in the film. Djimon Hounsou has a pretty good part. Nice to see him carry a substantial role. One good reason to see the film: great visuals, good looking people with consistent positive ideals.

The score was outstanding, the theme beautifully matching the opening to the film. Pity there wasn't more of it. Sean Bean, to those used to his villainous work in "Patriot Games", and "Goldeneye", was a little weak, but due to writing, not his thespian skills. And what's a Micheal Bay or Cohen Brothers movie without Steve Buscemi? His character was relatively weak, with no real motivation behind his actions in the film. Djimon Hounsou has a pretty good part. Nice to see him carry a substantial role. One good reason to see the film: great visuals, good looking people with consistent positive ideals. Pretty to watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":307439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-08-24","keywords":"year 2019,island,clone,same actor playing two characters simultaneously on screen,cityscape","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Island","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2968781081","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIwYzA2ZmMtZjFmNS00ZjdkLTk1MDAtNjM5Yjg0ZDQ2Y2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIwYzA2ZmMtZjFmNS00ZjdkLTk1MDAtNjM5Yjg0ZDQ2Y2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Dreamworks","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424060/","name":"Scarlett Johansson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005023/","name":"Djimon Hounsou"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000881/","name":"Michael Bay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108321/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1047021/","name":"Caspian Tredwell-Owen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0476064/","name":"Alex Kurtzman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0649460/","name":"Roberto Orci"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Well, the sorority girls are no longer what they used to be, and the pampered princesses throw Sydney out into the rain. She winds up taking refuge at the Vortex, a student housing building where lives the guy she dumped for a sorority mission and his six bizarre roommates.\n\nHonestly, I didn't think it would work.

I wouldn't say I'm an Amanda Bynes fan, but she failed to annoy me this time around! It was a great blend of an old story with modern college life with clever, roll-your-eyes references to the original Disney animated film. It might bother some people, but as a Snow White fan I thought they were cute. \n\nIt's definitely a girl movie, I'll give you that, so if you can't put up with the silliness and the cheesiness, you will not enjoy it. But if you're a girl looking for a cute movie with a lot of harmless fun, this will hit the spot. This is one I will definitely buy on DVD and watch when I need something light and fun.\n\nNot the most artistic of film making and not a whole lot of focus on in-depth characters and originality, but as a former teenage girl, I will happily give this adorable little film 7/10 for sheer sweetness, a good heart, and a passion for doing the right thing.

Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In "The Talented Mr Ripley" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In "Breaking And Entering" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in "The English Patient", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a "Minghellian" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":184174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"1996-12-06","keywords":"patient,nurse,flashback,english,church","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The English Patient","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi561882649","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjU5YjA1MGMtOTJlZi00MzQzLTgxYWQtZGNlNjI0NzgyZmY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjU5YjA1MGMtOTJlZi00MzQzLTgxYWQtZGNlNjI0NzgyZmY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The English Patient"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000146/","name":"Ralph Fiennes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000353/","name":"Willem Dafoe"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005237/","name":"Anthony Minghella"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034657/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0648546/","name":"Michael Ondaatje"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005237/","name":"Anthony Minghella"}],"duration":"PT2H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In "The Talented Mr Ripley" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In "Breaking And Entering" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in "The English Patient", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a "Minghellian" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":184174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"1996-12-06","keywords":"patient,nurse,flashback,english,church","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The English Patient","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi561882649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjU5YjA1MGMtOTJlZi00MzQzLTgxYWQtZGNlNjI0NzgyZmY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjU5YjA1MGMtOTJlZi00MzQzLTgxYWQtZGNlNjI0NzgyZmY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The English Patient","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000146/","name":"Ralph Fiennes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000353/","name":"Willem Dafoe"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005237/","name":"Anthony Minghella"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034657/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0648546/","name":"Michael Ondaatje","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005237/","name":"Anthony Minghella"],"duration":"PT2H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If the story doesn't require major air or naval assets, a script disapproved of by the top brass can be convincingly brought to the screen.  Two examples - both true stories that the Pentagon didn't want to support - are "Men of Honor" reflecting the epidemic racism of the not-that-long-ago Navy and "Sgt. Bilko," a film portraying what some noncoms do to earn extra income (trust me, it's a true story: a real Sgt. Bilko worked (officially but not actually) for me when I was an Army officer.\n\nBut when you need lots of planes and ships, you gotta have official help.

A mysterious and never explained weather phenomenon grips the mighty floating air base and to the unfolding amazement of captain, officers and crew dawns the realization that the Nimitz in sailing not that far from Pearl Harbor on 6 December 1941.\n\nMeanwhile a U.S. senator, played by one of Hollywood's deservedly decorated war heroes, Charles Durning, is enjoying his yacht, also near Pearl, while dictating to his lovely secretary, Katharine Ross.  A brace of Japanese Zeroes sink the yacht, killing two passengers which then prompts the carrier C.O. to order trailing F-14 Tomcats to "splash" the "enemy."  Durning and Ross are rescued.  Without a word, this talented actor's face does a comical double-take when introduced to the ship's executive officer who just happens to be black (in 1941 a black navy man could only serve as a steward in the officers mess.  That was it.  Period.)\n\nThe dilemma facing Douglas, of course, is a classic time-travel conundrum. To interfere with the course of history (the carrier's air wing can make instant teriyaki of the six Japanese carriers) or to let events take their known and disastrous course.\n\nA chaste incipient romance between the nearly drowned damsel and the carrier's Commander Air Group competes with the white knuckle decision-making struggle of the C.O.\n\nSo much for the plot.

A science fiction story is usually utterly improbable, indeed impossible, but its internal logic is vital: it must be consistent.  Spielberg understands that very well.

The whole crying game idea may have gone a little too far, but it was always amusing. Jim Carrey saves Ace Ventura from sinking to the totally brainless level of more recent crapfests as the Scary Movies, and even makes this into one of the better comedies of 1994.

    <desc lang="hr">Francuska serija pod nazivom "Profileri" predstavlja Chloé, kriminalističku psihologinju koja istražuje ubojice kako bi pomogla riješiti slučajeve zločina. Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

Do not expect a meaningless script like "super hero movie". Green Hornet has its own storyline that is consistent, but the characters and situations are hilarious.

The movie is not a classic main stream super hero movie but a very nice parody making fun of the way super hero movies are made, emphasizing on their blank spots. Do not expect a meaningless script like "super hero movie". Green Hornet has its own storyline that is consistent, but the characters and situations are hilarious. I haven't laughed so much for a long time, which makes the movie a success judging by the result. I believe it is a great way to spent an evening if you want to relax and watch an easy entertaining movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158116,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2011-01-12","keywords":"action hero,car accident,anti hero,car crash,car hit by a truck","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Green Hornet: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi21600537","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MDU2Mjc4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzk5MzIxNA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MDU2Mjc4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzk5MzIxNA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"By night, debonair newspaper publisher Britt Reid fights crime as a masked superhero known as The Green Hornet.

The success is attributable partly to the comedic talents of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence -- who have the ability to deliver crude, rude dialog such that it's funny nevertheless -- and partly to a story that combines suspense and humor into a believable whole. \n\n Our two heroes are police detectives Mike Lowry (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence), who are a kind of tough-cop variation on The Odd Couple . Lowry is suave, slick, self-controlled, well-to-do, heroic, and a real ladies man.  Burnett, on the other hand, is an ordinary guy who manages to stumble reasonably effectively, if somewhat ineptly, through his work and his married life.\n\nSo imagine what happens when Burnett has to convince a key witness, Julie (Téa Leoni) that he's Mike Lowry -- not just for a few hours, but for a few days.  Furthermore, this is no pre-planned, well-orchestrated masquerade.  A large stash of confiscated heroin has been un-confiscated right from police headquarters, and both the heroin and the perpetrator must be found within four days, or Internal Affairs is going to take some big-time disciplinary action.  Lowry and Burnett are called in because they were the ones who captured the heroin in the first place, and because of the one trait they share -- a renegade approach to police work, which may not have their boss's approval, but which does get the job done (and at one point, causes a store owner to think they're out to rob him).  The various twists and turns of the investigation lead to Lowry getting knocked out of commission at the same time that Julie witnesses a murder and refuses to deal with anybody but Mike Lowry.  But Marcus Burnett is the only one available to deal with her, and since waiting for Lowry to recover isn't an option   \n\nSubsequent events include Lowry's bachelor pad being invaded by Julie and her dogs, while Lowry stays with Burnett's wife, Burnett trying to keep his wife from finding out what's really going on, and Burnett and Lowry trying to find the heroin and keep Julie alive. \n\nFor all you action movie fans, plenty of cars, plenty of buildings, and plenty of people get blown up along the way.  (Looking over this review, I see that I've belied the high level of violence, which I definitely should warn you against.)\n\nBAD BOYS kept me both amused and on the edge of my seat throughout.

Second, I wish more time had been spent on Lowry's problem of stepping into Burnett's shoes.  The swinging bachelor having to play family man would have been good for a few laughs that we never got.\n\nAside from that, however, this is an action movie that stands out among the rest.\n\nOne final note concerning the DVD "Special Edition" release.

Iskorištava drugu šansu koju mu život pruža, a pogledajte hoće li je uspjeti iskoristiti na način kakav želi. Šest mjeseci karijere policajca, John Nolan je nastariji novajlija LAPD policije Los Angelesa, koji je koristio svoje stječeno životno iskustvo, upornost, i smisao za humor, kako bi održao korak s novajlijama koji su 20 godina mlađi od njega. Međutim, kako je prešao u drugu polovicu svoje gušterske godine, Nolana će čekati niz novih izazova, romantične veze i smrtonosni kriminalci, dok traži sebe kako bi konačno shvatio, kakav želi biti policajac.</desc>

Iskorištava drugu šansu koju mu život pruža, a pogledajte hoće li je uspjeti iskoristiti na način kakav želi. Šest mjeseci karijere policajca, John Nolan je nastariji novajlija LAPD policije Los Angelesa, koji je koristio svoje stječeno životno iskustvo, upornost, i smisao za humor, kako bi održao korak s novajlijama koji su 20 godina mlađi od njega. Međutim, kako je prešao u drugu polovicu svoje gušterske godine, Nolana će čekati niz novih izazova, romantične veze i smrtonosni kriminalci, dok traži sebe kako bi konačno shvatio, kakav želi biti policajac.</desc>

What I can say is that this movie was deftly directed with a perfect pacing that smoothly shifts through each gear from 1 to full throttle. It starts off with the necessary slow exposition, transitioning to a heartfelt family crisis drama and crime thriller with the tension slowly cranking up to a breakneck speed when I was literally holding my breath in the compelling edge of the seat finale.\n\nWhat I admire most about this film is the smooth kinetic flow from scene to scene. There didn't seem to be any implausible leap in logic apart from maybe towards the end but everything just connects together so well. All of the actors were superb in their roles. As for Russel Crowe, well I can't think of many actors who expresses wordless undying love better than he can. He is simply a master of it and you just cant help root for him even if he makes or contemplates morally wrong decisions.

What I can say is that this movie was deftly directed with a perfect pacing that smoothly shifts through each gear from 1 to full throttle. It starts off with the necessary slow exposition, transitioning to a heartfelt family crisis drama and crime thriller with the tension slowly cranking up to a breakneck speed when I was literally holding my breath in the compelling edge of the seat finale.\n\nWhat I admire most about this film is the smooth kinetic flow from scene to scene. There didn't seem to be any implausible leap in logic apart from maybe towards the end but everything just connects together so well. All of the actors were superb in their roles. As for Russel Crowe, well I can't think of many actors who expresses wordless undying love better than he can. He is simply a master of it and you just cant help root for him even if he makes or contemplates morally wrong decisions. His character is beautifully played with all the invulnerability, weaknesses and stubborn obsession he possesses.\n\nThe supporting actors were all excellent in the little screen time that they each get.

If you don't want to have your brain challenged by a time-line that bounces around and a complicated story that requires the viewer to put the pieces together you might want to save this for another night, but don't miss it, it's an incredible piece of writing and filmmaking.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":160385,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2007-12-26","keywords":"business,lawyer,poker game,faking a death,audio surveillance","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Michael Clayton","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2795045145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg1YTFlMmMtNzVlZC00ZTgyLWFjNDktNmVmNjIzZjVjMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg1YTFlMmMtNzVlZC00ZTgyLWFjNDktNmVmNjIzZjVjMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Bros.

The story of the ambitious twenty-seven year old Adam Cassidy with debts in the hospital for the expensive treatment of his father that in a couple of days becomes an important executive of a corporation competitor of the company that he was fired is totally absurd. He uses US$ 16,000 in the corporation card to party and what would he expect? Therefore, the tight spot that he is in is caused by a ridiculous situation. The coincidence of having one night stand with Emma Jennings is another unbelievable part of the screenplay. The unethical Adam Cassidy should have been in prison for a long period, since his lack of character and manipulation are disgusting. Emma returning to him is also incredible for an intelligent woman that was used. But forgetting these ridiculous situations, the viewer can enjoy the beauty of Amber Heard; the always great Gary Oldman and Richard Dreyfuss; see Josh "Sawyer" Holloway once again; and a good cast with Harrison Ford, Embeth Davidtz, Julian McMahon and Liam Hemsworth.

He uses US$ 16,000 in the corporation card to party and what would he expect? Therefore, the tight spot that he is in is caused by a ridiculous situation. The coincidence of having one night stand with Emma Jennings is another unbelievable part of the screenplay. The unethical Adam Cassidy should have been in prison for a long period, since his lack of character and manipulation are disgusting. Emma returning to him is also incredible for an intelligent woman that was used. But forgetting these ridiculous situations, the viewer can enjoy the beauty of Amber Heard; the always great Gary Oldman and Richard Dreyfuss; see Josh "Sawyer" Holloway once again; and a good cast with Harrison Ford, Embeth Davidtz, Julian McMahon and Liam Hemsworth. Shutdown your brain and you may have a good time. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Conexão Perigosa" ("Dangerous Connection")","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35979,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-08-16","keywords":"spying,thumbprint,traffic,man wears a swimsuit,man wrapped in a towel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3075778073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyODQ4NTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyODQ4NTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The two most powerful tech billionaires in the world are bitter rivals with a complicated past.

Only Darjeeling in India plays itself. My only trouble with it is the rather uneven character development. The story lends itself to ensemble playing but we learn little about two or three of the walkers. In the case of the lead character Janusz (Jim Sturgess) who is the source of the story this is explicable as we are seeing the others though his eyes, but it has to be said that both "Mr Smith" (the excellent Ed Harris) and the Girl (Saiorse Ronan) leave a lasting impression.\n\nI know there is some doubt as to the authenticity of the story, taken from a 1955 book by Slavimir Rawicz a former Polish army officer, and indeed what the group are supposed to have done looks impossible but that's not a problem, because the relationships ring true. It is remarkable how an almost random collection of individuals, including one with a very unsavoury past, can, driven by sheer necessity, wind up functioning as a team. Partly this is due to the leader actually having some navigational knowledge and therefore inspiring confidence in the others. Mr Smith remarks early on that the Janusz has a serious weakness; he is kind, but when the chips are down we see that even the hard-bitten Mr Smith is capable of compassion.\n\nStrangely enough, after the initial scenes in the prison camp, and the escape, there is not a lot of drama. The group encounter very few people on their travels and those they do meet take little interest in them (perhaps they had not heard about the bounty for escapees). Obtaining food and water is obviously a big issue, so mind out for the messy hunting scenes. I was astounded at how well their footwear stood up to the punishment; my hiking boots are not good for 400 miles let alone 4000. Actually they must have wandered around a bit - the northern end of Lake Baikal and Lhasa in Tibet are about 1800 miles apart, though the prison camp was somewhere north of the lake. It's also not clear how long the walk took, but at times it seemed like years. Weir's great achievement is to keep us watching a very drawn out tale. Personally I think I would have died of boredom if I had been in this particular walk, if starvation hadn't got me first.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2011-01-21","keywords":"survival,desert,escape,long walk,oasis","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Way Back ","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1465030937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyNzc5Mzc4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUxODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyNzc5Mzc4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUxODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young military officer (Sturgess) leads an escape from a hellish gulag in Siberia during WWII.

Only Darjeeling in India plays itself. My only trouble with it is the rather uneven character development. The story lends itself to ensemble playing but we learn little about two or three of the walkers. In the case of the lead character Janusz (Jim Sturgess) who is the source of the story this is explicable as we are seeing the others though his eyes, but it has to be said that both "Mr Smith" (the excellent Ed Harris) and the Girl (Saiorse Ronan) leave a lasting impression.\n\nI know there is some doubt as to the authenticity of the story, taken from a 1955 book by Slavimir Rawicz a former Polish army officer, and indeed what the group are supposed to have done looks impossible but that's not a problem, because the relationships ring true. It is remarkable how an almost random collection of individuals, including one with a very unsavoury past, can, driven by sheer necessity, wind up functioning as a team. Partly this is due to the leader actually having some navigational knowledge and therefore inspiring confidence in the others. Mr Smith remarks early on that the Janusz has a serious weakness; he is kind, but when the chips are down we see that even the hard-bitten Mr Smith is capable of compassion.\n\nStrangely enough, after the initial scenes in the prison camp, and the escape, there is not a lot of drama. The group encounter very few people on their travels and those they do meet take little interest in them (perhaps they had not heard about the bounty for escapees). Obtaining food and water is obviously a big issue, so mind out for the messy hunting scenes. I was astounded at how well their footwear stood up to the punishment; my hiking boots are not good for 400 miles let alone 4000. Actually they must have wandered around a bit - the northern end of Lake Baikal and Lhasa in Tibet are about 1800 miles apart, though the prison camp was somewhere north of the lake. It's also not clear how long the walk took, but at times it seemed like years. Weir's great achievement is to keep us watching a very drawn out tale.

The army training came in quite handy as he digs into the evidence of a heinous crime that turns out to be not at all what it seems to be on the surface. I was surprised at how funny the dialogue in this film was, it is definitely not a comedy, but the sarcastic and comedic one-liners kept coming, even in situations that were completely devoid of a humorous setting there was some very amusing conversation. There was even a scene in which Reacher is attacked in a bathroom that had me cracking up at the bumbling bad guys. The comedy was heightened even further with the old codger Cash (Robert Duvall). Mr. Duvall always delivers a convincing performance, same here. As with any film that features Mr. Cruise the expectation is that it will be fast paced and very entertaining, same here. The only thing missing was his trademark sprint to or after something or anything. I've just come to expect to see him running, really running but we are getting older. The trailer is the only kind that I like, the ones that do not give away the whole movie. It shows that Reacher is bad a$$ without playing out every aspect of the story. David Oyelowo (Emerson) is one to watch, he is building an impressive resume and it is easy to see why because whenever he portrays a character he is that character. When he played a pilot in Red Tails, I totally believed he could fly a plane. When he was the head of a company experimenting on Apes, I was again thoroughly convinced and I believed every aspect of his being a police detective. One of the best car chase scenes that I've seen lately was in this film. There were so many attributes of this film that I liked, including the sexual tension between Reacher and Helen Ronin (Rosamund Pike) that I will just sum it up by saying. Everything just seemed to be genuine and authentic, even though I know that the fights are staged they looked logistically correct, but Steven Segal did come to mind. I liked that the film had a legitimate beginning and end, even if there are subsequent Jack Reacher tales to follow, there was no gaping wide open door of a final scene leaving the audience wondering 'What's up with that?!?'. But I do hope there are sequels, at least one. I give it a green light","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":320689,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-12-26","keywords":"pittsburgh pennsylvania,sniper,coma,quarry,heads knocked together","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1158194201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NzA4NjU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4MzI2OA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NzA4NjU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4MzI2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A homicide investigator digs deeper into a case involving a trained military sniper who shot five random victims.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683253/","name":"Rosamund Pike"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0420955/","name":"Richard Jenkins"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0769768/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1676193/","name":"Lee Child"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The army training came in quite handy as he digs into the evidence of a heinous crime that turns out to be not at all what it seems to be on the surface. I was surprised at how funny the dialogue in this film was, it is definitely not a comedy, but the sarcastic and comedic one-liners kept coming, even in situations that were completely devoid of a humorous setting there was some very amusing conversation. There was even a scene in which Reacher is attacked in a bathroom that had me cracking up at the bumbling bad guys. The comedy was heightened even further with the old codger Cash (Robert Duvall). Mr. Duvall always delivers a convincing performance, same here. As with any film that features Mr. Cruise the expectation is that it will be fast paced and very entertaining, same here. The only thing missing was his trademark sprint to or after something or anything. I've just come to expect to see him running, really running but we are getting older. The trailer is the only kind that I like, the ones that do not give away the whole movie. It shows that Reacher is bad a$$ without playing out every aspect of the story. David Oyelowo (Emerson) is one to watch, he is building an impressive resume and it is easy to see why because whenever he portrays a character he is that character. When he played a pilot in Red Tails, I totally believed he could fly a plane. When he was the head of a company experimenting on Apes, I was again thoroughly convinced and I believed every aspect of his being a police detective. One of the best car chase scenes that I've seen lately was in this film. There were so many attributes of this film that I liked, including the sexual tension between Reacher and Helen Ronin (Rosamund Pike) that I will just sum it up by saying. Everything just seemed to be genuine and authentic, even though I know that the fights are staged they looked logistically correct, but Steven Segal did come to mind. I liked that the film had a legitimate beginning and end, even if there are subsequent Jack Reacher tales to follow, there was no gaping wide open door of a final scene leaving the audience wondering 'What's up with that?!?'. But I do hope there are sequels, at least one. I give it a green light","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":320689,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-12-26","keywords":"pittsburgh pennsylvania,sniper,coma,quarry,heads knocked together","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1158194201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NzA4NjU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4MzI2OA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NzA4NjU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4MzI2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A homicide investigator digs deeper into a case involving a trained military sniper who shot five random victims.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683253/","name":"Rosamund Pike","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0420955/","name":"Richard Jenkins"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0769768/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1676193/","name":"Lee Child","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"],"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

One can easily imagine him as a long-term bachelor falling for the beautiful, brave French partisan. Cotillard was also convincing as the ambiguous "femme fatale". Contrary to what some reviewers wrote, plenty of chemistry between the two, but also tenderness.\n\nIf you like movies with a solid plot, linear storytelling, believable characters, difficult choices, great costumes and soundtrack, then you should like this.\n\nP.S. couple of remarks: Pitt's French was not the best and no way he could have passed for Parisian, but that did not bother me too much.

Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?\n\nDom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions.

You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting.

His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.\n\nTo conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! \n\nMy Rating: 10/10\n\nThanks &amp; Regards","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2165826,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.\n\nTo conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! \n\nMy Rating: 10/10\n\nThanks &amp; Regards","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2165826,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As their focus in this impeccably rendered recreation of a moment in history, most palpably represented by the building of the Berlin Wall, Spielberg and screenwriters Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen have chosen a sort-of Atticus Finch of the north, a principled, American Everyman insurance attorney unexpectedly paged to represent a high-level Soviet spy caught in New York. There is no question that Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is guilty, but James B.

Ip Man was the Wing Chun grandmaster and his most famous student was Bruce Lee. This film chronicles the years leading up to his success as a martial arts teacher. It stars Tony Leung Chiu-Wai as Ip Man and Zhang Ziyi as Gong Er, his main love interest. Kar Wai Wong directed and co-wrote the movie (with Jingzhi Zou and Haofeng Xu). Wong is famous for directing and writing other popular Hong Kong period piece dramas like '2046' and 'IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE'. I'd rate this flick about the same as Wong's others; I thought it was extremely beautiful to look at but it's also a tad too hard to follow and uninvolving.\n\nThe story focuses as much on Gong Er (Ziyi) as it does Ip Man and follows a love story between the two as they keep in contact for many years following a fight for Gong's family's honor. Ip Man had defeated her father, Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang) in a battle that was as much about philosophical ideas as combat. The film follows Ip Man's years during the Second Sino-Japanese War, in 1938, struggling through poverty with his family. It also focuses on Gong Er's attempt at vengeance against the man who murdered her father, Ma San (Zhang Jin).\n\nThe story is told in a very disjointed way and it was really hard for me to keep up with what was going on in it. I often find these epic Hong Kong Kung Fu flicks to be dull anyway and wasn't too interested in seeing this one. It did get mostly good reviews from critics though and it's nominated for two 2014 Oscars (in Cinematography and Costume Design). It definitely deserves those award nominations and is very breathtaking to look at. I also think Zhang Ziyi is one of the more beautiful and sexy women in cinema today and she gives a great performance here. I'm not sure how I feel about Leung Chiu-Wai as an actor, he's not bad in this movie but I didn't really learn to care for his character much at all.

As things progress it does manage to find its feet, with a second act reminiscent of a small theatre play, time frames overlapping, lines twisting through their own narrative into others, it's wonderfully bonkers, albeit a tad overplayed.

It really doesn't live up to its trailer, but I'm still pleased I gave it a go.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2352,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-03-21","keywords":"demon,hypnosis,chamber drama,reality,one word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Luz","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3726490649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdlZmI3Y2QtNjFkNS00NDdhLTg1ZTYtNGYwZWFhMTQ4MGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdlZmI3Y2QtNjFkNS00NDdhLTg1ZTYtNGYwZWFhMTQ4MGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer #1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9547430/","name":"Luana Velis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1919245/","name":"Johannes Benecke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849059/","name":"Jan Bluthardt"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849061/","name":"Tilman Singer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053103/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849061/","name":"Tilman Singer"],"duration":"PT1H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In its grown-up seriousness and basis in historical conflict, Steven Spielberg's first feature since Lincoln three years ago joins the list of the director's half-dozen previous "war" films, but in its honoring of an American civilian who pulled off a smooth prisoner exchange between the East and West during a very tense period, the film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does now. Spielberg's fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, which world- premiered at the New York Film Festival and opens commercially on October 16, looks to generate stout box-office returns for Disney through the autumn season. For people of Spielberg's generation, the early years of the nuclear era and the stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union represents a significant part of the fabric of childhood. With the passage of time, it's possible to tell stories of the time without furnishing them with overt propagandistic overlays, and for Westerners there is the added built-in appeal of the "we won" factor and the perception that dealing with adversaries was so much simpler then than it is now.

In its grown-up seriousness and basis in historical conflict, Steven Spielberg's first feature since Lincoln three years ago joins the list of the director's half-dozen previous "war" films, but in its honoring of an American civilian who pulled off a smooth prisoner exchange between the East and West during a very tense period, the film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does now. Spielberg's fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, which world- premiered at the New York Film Festival and opens commercially on October 16, looks to generate stout box-office returns for Disney through the autumn season. For people of Spielberg's generation, the early years of the nuclear era and the stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union represents a significant part of the fabric of childhood. With the passage of time, it's possible to tell stories of the time without furnishing them with overt propagandistic overlays, and for Westerners there is the added built-in appeal of the "we won" factor and the perception that dealing with adversaries was so much simpler then than it is now. As their focus in this impeccably rendered recreation of a moment in history, most palpably represented by the building of the Berlin Wall, Spielberg and screenwriters Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen have chosen a sort-of Atticus Finch of the north, a principled, American Everyman insurance attorney unexpectedly paged to represent a high-level Soviet spy caught in New York.

Ip Man was the Wing Chun grandmaster and his most famous student was Bruce Lee. This film chronicles the years leading up to his success as a martial arts teacher. It stars Tony Leung Chiu-Wai as Ip Man and Zhang Ziyi as Gong Er, his main love interest. Kar Wai Wong directed and co-wrote the movie (with Jingzhi Zou and Haofeng Xu). Wong is famous for directing and writing other popular Hong Kong period piece dramas like '2046' and 'IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE'. I'd rate this flick about the same as Wong's others; I thought it was extremely beautiful to look at but it's also a tad too hard to follow and uninvolving.\n\nThe story focuses as much on Gong Er (Ziyi) as it does Ip Man and follows a love story between the two as they keep in contact for many years following a fight for Gong's family's honor. Ip Man had defeated her father, Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang) in a battle that was as much about philosophical ideas as combat. The film follows Ip Man's years during the Second Sino-Japanese War, in 1938, struggling through poverty with his family. It also focuses on Gong Er's attempt at vengeance against the man who murdered her father, Ma San (Zhang Jin).\n\nThe story is told in a very disjointed way and it was really hard for me to keep up with what was going on in it. I often find these epic Hong Kong Kung Fu flicks to be dull anyway and wasn't too interested in seeing this one. It did get mostly good reviews from critics though and it's nominated for two 2014 Oscars (in Cinematography and Costume Design). It definitely deserves those award nominations and is very breathtaking to look at. I also think Zhang Ziyi is one of the more beautiful and sexy women in cinema today and she gives a great performance here. I'm not sure how I feel about Leung Chiu-Wai as an actor, he's not bad in this movie but I didn't really learn to care for his character much at all. The martial-arts scenes are grand and epic though and I'm sure fans of the genre will be more than pleased.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTUUB4nMD6M","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32958,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-01-08","keywords":"ip man character,falling off a balcony,girl,crying,starving to death","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4109412633","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTc5NTA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMDc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTc5NTA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMDc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A story inspired by the life and times of the legendary kung fu master, Ip Man, and set in the tumultuous Republican era that followed the fall of ChinaÂ’s last dynasty, a time of chaos, division and war that was also the golden age of Chinese martial arts."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504897/","name":"Tony Chiu-Wai Leung"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1018221/","name":"Jin Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939182/","name":"Kar-Wai Wong"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070147/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074316/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239007/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939182/","name":"Kar-Wai Wong"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1802940/","name":"Jingzhi Zou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4192630/","name":"Haofeng Xu"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Ovo je istinita priča o onome što se dogodilo u Zimnicei u Rumunjskoj 4. ožujka 1977., na dan velikog potresa. Svi su znali da je 80% grada tog dana uništeno, i to su znali idućih 35 i više godina. Tek 2012. istina je izašla na vidjelo, a to je da je komunizam, a ne potres, upropastio Zimniceu.</desc>

Shot in black &amp; white and filmed in and around a New Jersey convenience store, "Clerks." is genius on celluloid despite little change of scenery, wooden acting (none of the actors are professionals), and a shoe-string budget; it's also pretty damn funny. "Just because they serve you, doesn't me they like you" became an immortal tagline for one of the best independent comedies of all time, which also launched the career of its director. There's nothing PC about this debut feature, and the relentlessly explicit sex-related dialogue got the film its original certificate, the dreaded "NC-17" rating, which was later dropped down to an "R" rating on a successful appeal by the filmmakers; the characters harass their customers, leave the store during the day to tend to personal matters, and hang-out with girlfriends - not the stuff of responsible employees - and definitely NOT something you would see in any Hollywood production today. In an era rife with censorship and political-correctness, "Clerks." would undoubtedly receive the scorn and protests of the fundamental religious Right and Left. The film features Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson), two bored New Jersey convenience store employees who are both called in on a Saturday (Dante is especially upset because it's his day off) and the two break every rule in the book as they meander through the day and encounter all sorts of colorful characters. Throughout the day, Dante complains about about his girlfriend Veronica's (Marilyn Ghigliotti) sex life, Randal shirks his convenience store duties by shooting the breeze with Dante, philosophize about their daily predicaments, play hockey on the roof of the store, and observe unruly and bizarre shoppers. There's little plot but it's pure fun all the way to the ending with plenty of laughs too. But if you're the sensitive type, you should stay as far away from "Clerks." as possible, as the dialogue will certainly make you squirm in your seat. "Clerks." also contains many Smith trademarks including "Star Wars" talk, references to Spielberg movies, comic books and hockey, all qualities of which would do Smith good in his so-called "New Jersey Trilogy."

Shot in black &amp; white and filmed in and around a New Jersey convenience store, "Clerks." is genius on celluloid despite little change of scenery, wooden acting (none of the actors are professionals), and a shoe-string budget; it's also pretty damn funny. "Just because they serve you, doesn't me they like you" became an immortal tagline for one of the best independent comedies of all time, which also launched the career of its director. There's nothing PC about this debut feature, and the relentlessly explicit sex-related dialogue got the film its original certificate, the dreaded "NC-17" rating, which was later dropped down to an "R" rating on a successful appeal by the filmmakers; the characters harass their customers, leave the store during the day to tend to personal matters, and hang-out with girlfriends - not the stuff of responsible employees - and definitely NOT something you would see in any Hollywood production today. In an era rife with censorship and political-correctness, "Clerks." would undoubtedly receive the scorn and protests of the fundamental religious Right and Left. The film features Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson), two bored New Jersey convenience store employees who are both called in on a Saturday (Dante is especially upset because it's his day off) and the two break every rule in the book as they meander through the day and encounter all sorts of colorful characters. Throughout the day, Dante complains about about his girlfriend Veronica's (Marilyn Ghigliotti) sex life, Randal shirks his convenience store duties by shooting the breeze with Dante, philosophize about their daily predicaments, play hockey on the roof of the store, and observe unruly and bizarre shoppers. There's little plot but it's pure fun all the way to the ending with plenty of laughs too. But if you're the sensitive type, you should stay as far away from "Clerks." as possible, as the dialogue will certainly make you squirm in your seat. "Clerks." also contains many Smith trademarks including "Star Wars" talk, references to Spielberg movies, comic books and hockey, all qualities of which would do Smith good in his so-called "New Jersey Trilogy." P.S.: Watch out for Smith in his iconic role as Silent Bob with sidekick Jay (Jason Mewes) as they loiter outside the store and hassle customers.\n\n10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":216513,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1994-11-09","keywords":"friendship,low budget film,friend,convenience store,stupidity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Clerks","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3706625561","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzc2ODIwZTAtYzBiMC00YjI4LWIxOTUtNzFmMjYwNzM0M2UzXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzc2ODIwZTAtYzBiMC00YjI4LWIxOTUtNzFmMjYwNzM0M2UzXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A day in the lives of two convenience clerks named Dante and Randal as they annoy customers, discuss movies, and play hockey on the store roof.

At the movie's beginning, we are informed that over 100,000 wild mustangs roam in the US, from which several hundreds are taken to prisons each year for training by inmates. The opening scenes bring us one of those round-ups, as a chopper is directing a herd of mustangs towards captivity. We are introduced to Roman, locked up (for what crime?) in a maximum security prison in Nevada. "I'm not good with people", he tells the reclassification officer, so she puts him in the outdoor maintenance program. Initially it's just cleaning up horse manure, but eventually he gets to work with one of the mustangs. In a parallel story, Roman is visited by his highly pregnant daughter, and their meeting is - strained... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the feature length directing debut of Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre (better known for her acting career in France), and what a debut it is! She also co-wrote the script. She brings a multi-faceted story: yes, there is the redemption side where a hardened criminal finds new hope when bonding with a mustang, but there is also the complicated father-daughter angle (which surprised me on several occasions as that played out), and of course there is the aspect of life in prison. Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts was made to play the role of Roman: a very physical yet nuanced performance (in the same way that it reminded me of Marlon Brando--but I'm not saying that Schoenaerts is in the league of Brando!). Bruce Dern has a small role as the heard of the mustang training program. The photography is eye-candy from start to finish. And then there are the mustangs, themselves a character in the movie. In the end, the biggest treasure that was uncovered in this film may well be Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre. I can't wait to see what she will do next. (Please note that Robert Redford is credited as Executive Producer.)\n\n"The Mustang" premiered to immediate acclaim at this year's Sundance film festival, It is not a coincidence that this movie is currently certified 95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. "The Mustang" recently opened at my art-house movie theater here in Cincinnati. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (5 people to be exact, myself included). That is a shame. Maybe the movie will find a wider audience as it is released in different formats. If you are up for a top-quality movie with a dazzling performance from Matthias Schoenaerts, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11538,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-06-19","keywords":"prison,horse,title directed by female,mustang the horse,wild mustang","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3905731097","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFkZTBkYmItY2RjOC00NWM2LWE0MDUtY2VkY2QyMjZjNTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFkZTBkYmItY2RjOC00NWM2LWE0MDUtY2VkY2QyMjZjNTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A violent convict is given the chance to participate in a rehabilitation therapy program involving the training of wild mustangs."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0774386/","name":"Matthias Schoenaerts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4207146/","name":"Jason Mitchell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001136/","name":"Bruce Dern"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166438/","name":"Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0641111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0807651/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166438/","name":"Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2178754/","name":"Mona Fastvold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0635431/","name":"Brock Norman Brock"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"The Mustang" recently opened at my art-house movie theater here in Cincinnati. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (5 people to be exact, myself included). That is a shame. Maybe the movie will find a wider audience as it is released in different formats. If you are up for a top-quality movie with a dazzling performance from Matthias Schoenaerts, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11538,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-06-19","keywords":"prison,horse,title directed by female,mustang the horse,wild mustang","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3905731097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFkZTBkYmItY2RjOC00NWM2LWE0MDUtY2VkY2QyMjZjNTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFkZTBkYmItY2RjOC00NWM2LWE0MDUtY2VkY2QyMjZjNTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A violent convict is given the chance to participate in a rehabilitation therapy program involving the training of wild mustangs.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0774386/","name":"Matthias Schoenaerts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4207146/","name":"Jason Mitchell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001136/","name":"Bruce Dern"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166438/","name":"Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0641111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0807651/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166438/","name":"Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2178754/","name":"Mona Fastvold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0635431/","name":"Brock Norman Brock"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film.

I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1706034,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":9.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1972-03-24","keywords":"crime family,mafia,patriarch,organized crime,rise to power","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer ","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1348706585","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWNlN2U4YjQtMzI3NC00ZjkxLWEwMTItYWRlNDUxYTYwYjVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWNlN2U4YjQtMzI3NC00ZjkxLWEwMTItYWRlNDUxYTYwYjVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg","description":"The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000008/","name":"Marlon Brando","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001001/","name":"James Caan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255097/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701374/","name":"Mario Puzo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"],"duration":"PT2H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

At the movie's beginning, we are informed that over 100,000 wild mustangs roam in the US, from which several hundreds are taken to prisons each year for training by inmates. The opening scenes bring us one of those round-ups, as a chopper is directing a herd of mustangs towards captivity. We are introduced to Roman, locked up (for what crime?) in a maximum security prison in Nevada. "I'm not good with people", he tells the reclassification officer, so she puts him in the outdoor maintenance program. Initially it's just cleaning up horse manure, but eventually he gets to work with one of the mustangs. In a parallel story, Roman is visited by his highly pregnant daughter, and their meeting is - strained... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the feature length directing debut of Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre (better known for her acting career in France), and what a debut it is! She also co-wrote the script. She brings a multi-faceted story: yes, there is the redemption side where a hardened criminal finds new hope when bonding with a mustang, but there is also the complicated father-daughter angle (which surprised me on several occasions as that played out), and of course there is the aspect of life in prison. Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts was made to play the role of Roman: a very physical yet nuanced performance (in the same way that it reminded me of Marlon Brando--but I'm not saying that Schoenaerts is in the league of Brando!). Bruce Dern has a small role as the heard of the mustang training program. The photography is eye-candy from start to finish. And then there are the mustangs, themselves a character in the movie. In the end, the biggest treasure that was uncovered in this film may well be Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre. I can't wait to see what she will do next. (Please note that Robert Redford is credited as Executive Producer.)\n\n"The Mustang" premiered to immediate acclaim at this year's Sundance film festival, It is not a coincidence that this movie is currently certified 95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. "The Mustang" recently opened at my art-house movie theater here in Cincinnati. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (5 people to be exact, myself included). That is a shame. Maybe the movie will find a wider audience as it is released in different formats.

If you are up for a top-quality movie with a dazzling performance from Matthias Schoenaerts, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11538,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-06-19","keywords":"prison,horse,title directed by female,mustang the horse,wild mustang","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3905731097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFkZTBkYmItY2RjOC00NWM2LWE0MDUtY2VkY2QyMjZjNTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFkZTBkYmItY2RjOC00NWM2LWE0MDUtY2VkY2QyMjZjNTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A violent convict is given the chance to participate in a rehabilitation therapy program involving the training of wild mustangs.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0774386/","name":"Matthias Schoenaerts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4207146/","name":"Jason Mitchell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001136/","name":"Bruce Dern"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166438/","name":"Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0641111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0807651/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166438/","name":"Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2178754/","name":"Mona Fastvold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0635431/","name":"Brock Norman Brock"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Thank the tech nerds for the internet that allows me to see shows from all the world. They are who have given me access to great shows such as The Killing (Danish), Downton Abbey, Miss Fisher and so many more.\n\nIf you can appreciate amazing costume design and construction within a universe that is also beautifully shot and written. Yes, the murder mystery formula may be derivative, but as a woman, I appreciate the strength of Miss Fisher and those she assembles around her. Her mischievous, but lovable antics are endearing. And, the writing is just good enough to make this a 9 in my book. I think this is a step above Downton Abbey or any of the other Edwardian and/or 20s period television soapies.\n\nIt may be reconstructed history...but it is fun. It's great for the whole family. There are adult themes, but if you are forward thinking parents, this is completely within the parameters of what your kids should be aware of and take as reality. If only the 1920s Australia were this "contemporary".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14757,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-02-24","keywords":"liberated woman,headstrong woman,detective,surname in series title,equality for women","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204583/","name":"Essie Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656289/","name":"Nathan Page","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3793639/","name":"Hugo Johnstone-Burt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346452/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3789075225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I think Miss Fisher's Murder Mystery only lasted for 2-3 seasons.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2001,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2017-11-06","keywords":"toronto canada,investigation,mother daughter relationship,female partner,crime solving","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0809049/","name":"Lauren Lee Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6698172/","name":"Chantel Riley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4428734/","name":"Rebecca Liddiard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330410/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086650/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370474/","name":"Carol Hay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3687965/","name":"Michelle Ricci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Frankie Drake: Season 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3482828569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk5NjFmYjUtMzljMy00Y2JiLTk4OGMtNDQ3ZTg2MzUxZjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk5NjFmYjUtMzljMy00Y2JiLTk4OGMtNDQ3ZTg2MzUxZjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I am watching with someone who is hard of hearing and has to mostly read the script. Last night they were talking of furniture in the French Louis XV style. It is always read as Louis the fifteenth or often in French Quinze (pronounced cans - and that is exactly what the close caption said in the style of Louis cans - I had to explain that one to my mom!) Then a few moments later, Miss Marple talked about the problem of yarn balls vs skeins, except the close caption said yarn scans. So confusing for the reader. There are mistakes and horrible scripting throughout almost every episode.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6990,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-12-12","keywords":"united kingdom,murder,detective,female detective,england","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568603/","name":"Geraldine McEwan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571549/","name":"Julia McKenzie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161410/","name":"Stephen Churchett"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104279/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103605/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041824/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Agatha Christie's Marple: The Julia McKenzie Collection","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4158173977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA0OWUwNDEtNjBmMS00OTQ4LThmOWItYTBkNDY4M2RhYWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA0OWUwNDEtNjBmMS00OTQ4LThmOWItYTBkNDY4M2RhYWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Agatha Christie's Marple: The Julia McKenzie Collection"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He brings class, sophistication and integrity to his performances. The rest of the cast for Blue Bloods meshes well with the high standards set here. It is refreshing to see characters who are not afraid to admit they make mistakes, who often question what is done and why. It is also very refreshing to see an ensemble with a strong sense of faith and goodness.\n\nPlease continue the practice of saying a blessing before meals - this helps to set the tone of the characters and helps viewers to understand the strength that a strong Irish Catholic family has - all of the members of the Reagan family are strong and they have the courage and faith to stand up for what is right. This comes from their traditions and their beliefs.\n\nIn my humble opinion, this is one of the best dramas on television today and I would not be embarrassed to have my grandchildren watch it with me. Can't say that for most of the programming on prime time these days.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34905,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-09-24","keywords":"new york police department,family relationships,brother brother relationship,father daughter relationship,family of cops","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005531/","name":"Donnie Wahlberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005256/","name":"Bridget Moynahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0261678/","name":"Will Estes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106949/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315236/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121331/","name":"Mitchell Burgess","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1053841/","name":"Robin Green"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blue Bloods: Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4119967769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"First Look Trailer for Blue Bloods"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Whatever I expected this to be, it turned out far better. Adam Brody gave an amazing performance, somewhat similar to a live action BoJack Horseman in this movie (obviously with detectives instead of actors). The comedy is really good too, the film knows how to make the audience laugh and when it's appropriate to do so. Not every line is hilarious, but a majority of the jokes tend to land. A sign of a good movie is, despite however much comedy it is, it's plot is well thought out, unpredictable, and possibly one of the most well done mysteries I've seen.

Whatever I expected this to be, it turned out far better. Adam Brody gave an amazing performance, somewhat similar to a live action BoJack Horseman in this movie (obviously with detectives instead of actors). The comedy is really good too, the film knows how to make the audience laugh and when it's appropriate to do so. Not every line is hilarious, but a majority of the jokes tend to land. A sign of a good movie is, despite however much comedy it is, it's plot is well thought out, unpredictable, and possibly one of the most well done mysteries I've seen. It fits perfectly with the tone, plot, and characters. And the ending! The ending! Something so different from the rest of the movie, but something that works so well with it!

The actors who make up the main cast are all very talented and the writing allows us glimpses into the entire cast, though the show is clearly focused on Brenda. Each episode also allows the viewer to see some of the personal drama without being heavy-handed or too soap-opera, keeping a good balance between the police investigation and the people who are doing the investigation.\n\nI find it interesting, however, that most of the people I know who do not like the show are male and love similar stories where a male in the central authority and does the exact same things that Brenda does to close a case.

Can't say that for most of the programming on prime time these days.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34905,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-09-24","keywords":"new york police department,family relationships,brother brother relationship,father daughter relationship,family of cops","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005531/","name":"Donnie Wahlberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005256/","name":"Bridget Moynahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0261678/","name":"Will Estes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106949/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315236/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121331/","name":"Mitchell Burgess","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1053841/","name":"Robin Green"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blue Bloods: Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4119967769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"First Look Trailer for Blue Bloods"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

From the beginning episodes where Brenda's staff worked against her, sometimes with the expressed desire for her to fail, to the latest season where they appear to be firmly on her "side" there is an interesting dynamic in showing an intelligent and capable woman as authority-figure and the gradual and sometimes reluctant acceptance of her as the officers she works with see for themselves what she is bringing to the dept.\n\nThe show brings a lot of elements of the classic mysteries, and uses clever reveals and intelligence as well as past personal experiences and leaps of intuition in solving crimes. The actors who make up the main cast are all very talented and the writing allows us glimpses into the entire cast, though the show is clearly focused on Brenda. Each episode also allows the viewer to see some of the personal drama without being heavy-handed or too soap-opera, keeping a good balance between the police investigation and the people who are doing the investigation.\n\nI find it interesting, however, that most of the people I know who do not like the show are male and love similar stories where a male in the central authority and does the exact same things that Brenda does to close a case.

He brings class, sophistication and integrity to his performances. The rest of the cast for Blue Bloods meshes well with the high standards set here. It is refreshing to see characters who are not afraid to admit they make mistakes, who often question what is done and why. It is also very refreshing to see an ensemble with a strong sense of faith and goodness.\n\nPlease continue the practice of saying a blessing before meals - this helps to set the tone of the characters and helps viewers to understand the strength that a strong Irish Catholic family has - all of the members of the Reagan family are strong and they have the courage and faith to stand up for what is right. This comes from their traditions and their beliefs.\n\nIn my humble opinion, this is one of the best dramas on television today and I would not be embarrassed to have my grandchildren watch it with me. Can't say that for most of the programming on prime time these days.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34905,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-09-24","keywords":"new york police department,family relationships,brother brother relationship,father daughter relationship,family of cops","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005531/","name":"Donnie Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005256/","name":"Bridget Moynahan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0261678/","name":"Will Estes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106949/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315236/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121331/","name":"Mitchell Burgess"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1053841/","name":"Robin Green"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blue Bloods: Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4119967769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"First Look Trailer for Blue Bloods"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He brings class, sophistication and integrity to his performances. The rest of the cast for Blue Bloods meshes well with the high standards set here. It is refreshing to see characters who are not afraid to admit they make mistakes, who often question what is done and why. It is also very refreshing to see an ensemble with a strong sense of faith and goodness.\n\nPlease continue the practice of saying a blessing before meals - this helps to set the tone of the characters and helps viewers to understand the strength that a strong Irish Catholic family has - all of the members of the Reagan family are strong and they have the courage and faith to stand up for what is right. This comes from their traditions and their beliefs.\n\nIn my humble opinion, this is one of the best dramas on television today and I would not be embarrassed to have my grandchildren watch it with me. Can't say that for most of the programming on prime time these days.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34905,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-09-24","keywords":"new york police department,family relationships,brother brother relationship,father daughter relationship,family of cops","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005531/","name":"Donnie Wahlberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005256/","name":"Bridget Moynahan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0261678/","name":"Will Estes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106949/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315236/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121331/","name":"Mitchell Burgess","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1053841/","name":"Robin Green"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blue Bloods: Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4119967769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"First Look Trailer for Blue Bloods"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Whatever I expected this to be, it turned out far better. Adam Brody gave an amazing performance, somewhat similar to a live action BoJack Horseman in this movie (obviously with detectives instead of actors). The comedy is really good too, the film knows how to make the audience laugh and when it's appropriate to do so. Not every line is hilarious, but a majority of the jokes tend to land.

Whatever I expected this to be, it turned out far better. Adam Brody gave an amazing performance, somewhat similar to a live action BoJack Horseman in this movie (obviously with detectives instead of actors). The comedy is really good too, the film knows how to make the audience laugh and when it's appropriate to do so. Not every line is hilarious, but a majority of the jokes tend to land. A sign of a good movie is, despite however much comedy it is, it's plot is well thought out, unpredictable, and possibly one of the most well done mysteries I've seen.

They even have a Kung-Fu remake coming that changed the lead to a woman. I mean WTF?)! Every woman is portrayed as smart and tough while the men are stupid and weak! Most of them like Laurel Lance &amp; Catwoman look so ridiculous in their fight scenes. It doesn't look like their kicks would hurt a 3-year old but a grown man goes flying or knocked out from a hit that again, wouldn't hurt a child!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":325006,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-10-07","keywords":"superhuman speed,dc arrowverse,superhero,dc comics,based on comic","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2652716/","name":"Grant Gustin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2765384/","name":"Candice Patton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1263939/","name":"Danielle Panabaker"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330789/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075528/","name":"Greg Berlanti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424315/","name":"Geoff Johns","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1132610/","name":"Andrew Kreisberg"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 7 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3478176025","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2MxMDdhNWQtZGM2OC00MTI1LTgxMjItMmQ4Y2YwYzc1MjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2MxMDdhNWQtZGM2OC00MTI1LTgxMjItMmQ4Y2YwYzc1MjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on characters from DC's The Flash.

U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Teorija velikog praska</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Deseta sezona staroj ekipi donosi u život nove ljude poput djeteta Howarda i Bernadette, ali ljubavni problemi svih genijalaca su i dalje prisutni. U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"reunited friends,funeral,old friends reunited,ash scattering,pregnant wife","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"reunited friends,funeral,old friends reunited,ash scattering,pregnant wife","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"reunited friends,funeral,old friends reunited,ash scattering,pregnant wife","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"reunited friends,funeral,old friends reunited,ash scattering,pregnant wife","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You viewer feel as though you are there, making history. The four stars involved have, each of them, never given a bad performance in their careers and they surely maintain their records here.\n\nEd Harris in particular -- although he has less screen time -- will always to this reviewer seem a vastly under-rated actor. (This review written in 2017 where an older Harris still uses his charisma in a defining role for HBOs Westworld .... and nails it.) Recommended? Absolutely! In the Metacritic data that IMDb so helpfully provides I could not help but notice one reviewer commenting that, well, it sure isn't in the same class as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.\n\nWhich is the irony of doing film reviews. I have never not once thought of wanting to see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN again, but this film is one I like to revisit every few years. Magnificent.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":251504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2002-05-01","keywords":"sniper,stalingrad,battle,world war two soldier,weapon","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Enemy at the Gates","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1218773273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQ4NzVlZGYtMDBkZS00OTJmLWExYzItZWM2Zjc0NTYwYTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQ4NzVlZGYtMDBkZS00OTJmLWExYzItZWM2Zjc0NTYwYTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "Coming Soon""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001212/","name":"Joseph Fiennes"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000269/","name":"Jean-Jacques Annaud"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013922/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076287/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000269/","name":"Jean-Jacques Annaud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0323708/","name":"Alain Godard"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You viewer feel as though you are there, making history. The four stars involved have, each of them, never given a bad performance in their careers and they surely maintain their records here.\n\nEd Harris in particular -- although he has less screen time -- will always to this reviewer seem a vastly under-rated actor. (This review written in 2017 where an older Harris still uses his charisma in a defining role for HBOs Westworld .... and nails it.) Recommended? Absolutely! In the Metacritic data that IMDb so helpfully provides I could not help but notice one reviewer commenting that, well, it sure isn't in the same class as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.\n\nWhich is the irony of doing film reviews. I have never not once thought of wanting to see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN again, but this film is one I like to revisit every few years. Magnificent.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":251504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2002-05-01","keywords":"sniper,stalingrad,battle,world war two soldier,weapon","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Enemy at the Gates","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1218773273","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQ4NzVlZGYtMDBkZS00OTJmLWExYzItZWM2Zjc0NTYwYTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQ4NzVlZGYtMDBkZS00OTJmLWExYzItZWM2Zjc0NTYwYTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "Coming Soon"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001212/","name":"Joseph Fiennes"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000269/","name":"Jean-Jacques Annaud"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013922/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076287/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000269/","name":"Jean-Jacques Annaud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0323708/","name":"Alain Godard"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In "Temple of Doom", the year is 1935. See what I mean? "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is another rollercoaster ride of a movie brought to life by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Harrison Ford is back as archaeologist Indiana Jones who this time searches for a sacred stone that was stolen from an Indian village. Along for the ride is American singer/entertainer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw, aka Mrs. Steven Spielberg) and little Chinese sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan).

The action and special effects are first-rate as you would expect, though the story is a tad weaker than it was in "Raiders". Plus, Capshaw's performance leaves something to be desired. She goes so far over-the-top in some scenes that you'd wish Karen Allen would show up as Marion. Nevertheless, Capshaw isn't all that bad. She does make an impression during the times when she's not screaming. But Ke Huy Quan (now known as Jonathan Ke Quan) comes off better as Indy's young sidekick. The following year he starred in the Spielberg produced Richard Donner directed "The Goonies", but then didn't appear in much after that.

So after "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" and "Gremlins" opened in theaters at the beginning of the summer movie season of 1984 and became two of that year's biggest hits, the MPAA realized a new rating had to be created. The PG-13 rating was born. In August 1984, the first movies were released with the new PG-13 rating ("Red Dawn" and "The Woman in Red"). It's not a new rating anymore.

I'll admit the acting may not have been to it's full potential.. but I still thought it was pretty good. The movie is based on dancing and overall I thought the technique was very good. The talent displayed in this movie is extraordinary. The movie has romance, comedy, tragedy, and nearly everything else you would want in a good movie. The music in this movie is also really good. I would say this movie is well worth the money I spent. Step Up is inspirational and was everything I was expecting it to be. I'd highly recommend seeing it. If you enjoyed the movie Save The Last Dance this is probably a good movie for you. I found this movie to be very uplifting.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113937,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2007-02-07","keywords":"title directed by female,dance school,dance movie,disney,community service","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Step Up","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1820374553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTU1NzU5MjkwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk5NDkxMDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTU1NzU5MjkwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk5NDkxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Step Up","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1564087/","name":"Jenna Dewan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1690482/","name":"Damaine Radcliff"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281945/","name":"Anne Fletcher"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046206/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0163665/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0012137/","name":"Duane Adler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0742279/","name":"Melissa Rosenberg"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The way the movie started in Europe and how dark it was there... and the journey to Jerusalem... just wonderful stuff up to that point.\n\nLiam Neeson, as usual, is just SO GOOD, you wish he had more screen time.\n\n\n* Orlando Bloom, actually surprisingly, was able to carry the movie as a lead. I was surprised he had the heft to do it, but I agree with the critic who said that the beard helped. He was a man, not a boy.\n\n\n\n* Battle scenes... incredible. I was really surprised that they could wow me, since we've been numbed by the quality of battle scenes in so many previous movies, but they did a great job.\n\n\n\n* Portrayal of the Muslims. EXTREMELY fair.

The way the movie started in Europe and how dark it was there... and the journey to Jerusalem... just wonderful stuff up to that point.\n\nLiam Neeson, as usual, is just SO GOOD, you wish he had more screen time.\n\n\n* Orlando Bloom, actually surprisingly, was able to carry the movie as a lead. I was surprised he had the heft to do it, but I agree with the critic who said that the beard helped. He was a man, not a boy.\n\n\n\n* Battle scenes... incredible. I was really surprised that they could wow me, since we've been numbed by the quality of battle scenes in so many previous movies, but they did a great job.\n\n\n\n* Portrayal of the Muslims. EXTREMELY fair. In being "even-handed" to Christians and Muslims there, if anything, they emphasized the Christian fanatics (in the form of the Templars in particular, to simplify things) as being the "badguys" more than anyone else...

Dragonheart is not cynical at all, and is lots of fun for kids of all ages (why is this movie PG13?). If you're looking for a really ferocious dragon, Draco isn't it.  Draco is much more human than most movie dragons (if you want a scary dragon, watch Dragonslayer), but he is very realistic.  In fact, the scenes without him tend to drag, but Dennis Quaid's Bowen is strong as the disillusioned knight.  If you are looking for a deep plot, you won't find it, but that's no big deal.  Dragonheart is more about adventure and dragons than about plot twists and in depth characterizations.  Edelman's music is great for the most part, especially in the final scenes, which I think are the best in the movie.

Dragonheart is not cynical at all, and is lots of fun for kids of all ages (why is this movie PG13?). If you're looking for a really ferocious dragon, Draco isn't it.  Draco is much more human than most movie dragons (if you want a scary dragon, watch Dragonslayer), but he is very realistic.  In fact, the scenes without him tend to drag, but Dennis Quaid's Bowen is strong as the disillusioned knight.  If you are looking for a deep plot, you won't find it, but that's no big deal.  Dragonheart is more about adventure and dragons than about plot twists and in depth characterizations.  Edelman's music is great for the most part, especially in the final scenes, which I think are the best in the movie.  Check it out.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1996-05-31","keywords":"dragon,king,knight,human dragon relationship,england","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dragonheart","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3548882457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwMDI3MGEtMGVlYy00Y2ZlLWE2YjEtN2NkNGE4NGIxMWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwMDI3MGEtMGVlYy00Y2ZlLWE2YjEtN2NkNGE4NGIxMWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for Dragonheart","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000598/","name":"Dennis Quaid","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000539/","name":"Dina Meyer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003418/","name":"Rob Cohen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425957/","name":"Patrick Read Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688279/","name":"Charles Edward Pogue"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I do not see myself as someone who is into the New York scene of style, glamour, or fashion but the show helps me understand where men and women go wrong in relationships.\n\nLike I said, I am a teenager, so I am entirely new to relationships, but I feel so confused at times by what women are thinking and why they do certain things. Miranda, Charlotte, Samantha, and Carrie openly discuss their relationships with men and I find it helpful to look into the female psyche. There are a lot of cautionary tales about men during the show about what not to do during a relationship. The way men are portrayed is not much different from reality because men hide secrets, have strange desires in bed, have commitment problems, bad hygiene, etc.\n\nThe interesting thing I notice from all four of the main leads is the tendency to overthink a man's exact words. A small piece of advice for any woman that I have, is that men (including me) are dumb and are very simplistic when we mean something. In my experience, it is very rare when a man has the ability to be very manipulative towards others, especially women.\n\nLastly, the show is very educational for me. I do not necessarily agree with plot lines at times, but the show is reality in a way it feels others cannot achieve. I suggest that everyone watch the show, for me, it has been very helpful.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113601,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-06-06","keywords":"love life,friendship between women,friendship,singles,casual sex","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000326/","name":"Kim Cattrall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004862/","name":"Kristin Davis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020963/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050436/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823015/","name":"Darren Star"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sex and the City: The Sixth Season - Part 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi394723609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There are a lot of cautionary tales about men during the show about what not to do during a relationship. The way men are portrayed is not much different from reality because men hide secrets, have strange desires in bed, have commitment problems, bad hygiene, etc.\n\nThe interesting thing I notice from all four of the main leads is the tendency to overthink a man's exact words. A small piece of advice for any woman that I have, is that men (including me) are dumb and are very simplistic when we mean something. In my experience, it is very rare when a man has the ability to be very manipulative towards others, especially women.\n\nLastly, the show is very educational for me. I do not necessarily agree with plot lines at times, but the show is reality in a way it feels others cannot achieve. I suggest that everyone watch the show, for me, it has been very helpful.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113601,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-06-06","keywords":"love life,friendship between women,friendship,singles,casual sex","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000326/","name":"Kim Cattrall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004862/","name":"Kristin Davis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020963/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050436/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823015/","name":"Darren Star"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sex and the City: The Sixth Season - Part 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi394723609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It was hilarious the first time you told it. So you kept telling it over and over again. You told your mom, your friends, your wacky uncle and heck you even told it to your baby sister. Each time you tell that joke it lost some of its charm and you know this in your heart, but you keep telling it because it made you someone who was at least bearable at the office party. The Hangover Part III is THAT dreaded, self-destructive joke. \n\nThe first The Hangover was a surprise to everyone. It was a smart, engaging and an all-around funny move. It made the three protagonists into overnight stars, along with Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). Since The Hangover these four guys have experienced great success; Bradley Cooper has been nominated for an Oscar, Ed Helms became a little more then Andy from The Office, and Zach Galifianakis (the funniest of the bunch) starred on HBO's Bored to Death and Ken Jeong is a recurring character on Community. It's no surprise then that The Hangover made these guys in demand, and had the audience craving for more. So what better way to give the masses what they want than bringing the Wolf Pack back together for two more subpar movies. The Hangover Part III brings the crew back together for yet another wacky adventure, this time getting them to go to Tijuana and back to Vegas. There isn't really much to tell you about the plot that you can't figure out yourself. So it makes very little sense to go in any further detail about it, and I can move on to things that worked.\n\nBy far the funniest moment during the movie for my money's worth was when some girl in the theater screamed out loud after seeing one of the main character dangle for his life. The whole theater roared, and it was a genuinely hilarious moment. Too bad the same can't be said about the rest of the movie. No doubt there were some funny moments and personally the best bits of the movie were when Melissa Mccarthy was on the screen. Some of the other funniest moments were throwbacks to the original. I found myself doing a lot of "ooh I remember that from the first movie. Ha ha that reference is funny." Unfortunately that is all this movie is, it's a reminder of how great The Hangover was and we should nostalgia- laugh (is something I just made up) because we once thought there was no one funnier than Zack Galifianakis. Other than that any original content was drab at best. \n\nThe best laughs came from all the supporting characters, and the 'Big 3' it felt like were just there to collect the pay check. Bradly Cooper was by far the worst of the bunch. It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who was nominated for an Oscar not very long ago. Ed Helms and Zack Galifianakis were at least trying.\n\nIt was the overall chemistry of the three characters that made the original so great. The Hangover was a perfect recipe of Mac and Cheese where you threw in random ingredients and IT WAS THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE YOU EVER MADE! You tried replicating the original time after time, and tasted nothing but cheese and disappointment. It was just another Mac and Cheese. Sure it was served its purpose of feeding your broke student ass, but you yearned for that perfect gourmet Mac and Cheese fit to serve Gordon Ramsay himself. \n\nThe Hangover Part III is not a movie for people who are looking for genuine comedy. There are some very funny moments but the cheap laughs far outnumber the good ones. If you're going in expecting a repeat of The Hangover then don't waste your time and money. If you were disappointed by The Hangover Part II this movie will only throw salt on your wounds. It's sad to see such an initially brilliant trilogy end like this. Hangover 3 was nothing but one last attempt at squeezing every last dollar from the franchise. The Hangover Part III gets 5 nostalgia-laughs out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":302444,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2013-05-29","keywords":"heart attack,giraffe,breast implant,prostitute,karaoke bar","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2312742425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This time, there's no wedding.

It was hilarious the first time you told it. So you kept telling it over and over again. You told your mom, your friends, your wacky uncle and heck you even told it to your baby sister. Each time you tell that joke it lost some of its charm and you know this in your heart, but you keep telling it because it made you someone who was at least bearable at the office party. The Hangover Part III is THAT dreaded, self-destructive joke. \n\nThe first The Hangover was a surprise to everyone. It was a smart, engaging and an all-around funny move. It made the three protagonists into overnight stars, along with Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). Since The Hangover these four guys have experienced great success; Bradley Cooper has been nominated for an Oscar, Ed Helms became a little more then Andy from The Office, and Zach Galifianakis (the funniest of the bunch) starred on HBO's Bored to Death and Ken Jeong is a recurring character on Community. It's no surprise then that The Hangover made these guys in demand, and had the audience craving for more. So what better way to give the masses what they want than bringing the Wolf Pack back together for two more subpar movies. The Hangover Part III brings the crew back together for yet another wacky adventure, this time getting them to go to Tijuana and back to Vegas. There isn't really much to tell you about the plot that you can't figure out yourself. So it makes very little sense to go in any further detail about it, and I can move on to things that worked.\n\nBy far the funniest moment during the movie for my money's worth was when some girl in the theater screamed out loud after seeing one of the main character dangle for his life. The whole theater roared, and it was a genuinely hilarious moment. Too bad the same can't be said about the rest of the movie. No doubt there were some funny moments and personally the best bits of the movie were when Melissa Mccarthy was on the screen. Some of the other funniest moments were throwbacks to the original. I found myself doing a lot of "ooh I remember that from the first movie. Ha ha that reference is funny." Unfortunately that is all this movie is, it's a reminder of how great The Hangover was and we should nostalgia- laugh (is something I just made up) because we once thought there was no one funnier than Zack Galifianakis. Other than that any original content was drab at best. \n\nThe best laughs came from all the supporting characters, and the 'Big 3' it felt like were just there to collect the pay check. Bradly Cooper was by far the worst of the bunch. It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who was nominated for an Oscar not very long ago. Ed Helms and Zack Galifianakis were at least trying.\n\nIt was the overall chemistry of the three characters that made the original so great. The Hangover was a perfect recipe of Mac and Cheese where you threw in random ingredients and IT WAS THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE YOU EVER MADE! You tried replicating the original time after time, and tasted nothing but cheese and disappointment. It was just another Mac and Cheese. Sure it was served its purpose of feeding your broke student ass, but you yearned for that perfect gourmet Mac and Cheese fit to serve Gordon Ramsay himself. \n\nThe Hangover Part III is not a movie for people who are looking for genuine comedy. There are some very funny moments but the cheap laughs far outnumber the good ones. If you're going in expecting a repeat of The Hangover then don't waste your time and money. If you were disappointed by The Hangover Part II this movie will only throw salt on your wounds. It's sad to see such an initially brilliant trilogy end like this. Hangover 3 was nothing but one last attempt at squeezing every last dollar from the franchise. The Hangover Part III gets 5 nostalgia-laughs out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":302444,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2013-05-29","keywords":"heart attack,giraffe,breast implant,prostitute,karaoke bar","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2312742425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This time, there's no wedding.

That being said however I was very excited to return to Middle Earth for a new story..and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.\n\nThis is the Prequel story to LOTR following the adventures of Bilbo Baggins (Frodo's Uncle played by Ian Holm previously) and how he came to be in possession on the ring. \n\nPeter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. .is quite simply a BEAUTIFUL film! I saw the movie in 3D and at the 48fps that Jackson intended and I was blown away by how it looked. It's a stunning film that left me with the same 'WOW' factor that the original trilogy did a decade ago. Set 60 years earlier than Lord of The Rings, We are introduced to a much younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman). He is a content Hobbit, not concerned with adventure of any sort. Until Gandalf (Ian McKellan) suddenly appears, along with a group of unruly Dwarfs and offers Bilbo the chance to be part of a great adventure. The dwarfs wish to reclaim their homeland, which has been taken over by a huge dragon named Smaug, It's a simple concept and one that probably shouldn't be stretched over 3 movies but as with any 'first in a trilogy' film, it sets the stage perfectly. The movie has some great scenes.. meeting the Dwarfs in Bilbo's house, the run in with fighting stone giants and the escape from deep within the goblins' mountain are particular highlights. I loved the scene in which Bilbo runs into a familiar face (for LOTR fans) in the caves: Gollum (who looks amazing with todays MOCAP technology).

That being said however I was very excited to return to Middle Earth for a new story..and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.\n\nThis is the Prequel story to LOTR following the adventures of Bilbo Baggins (Frodo's Uncle played by Ian Holm previously) and how he came to be in possession on the ring. \n\nPeter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. .is quite simply a BEAUTIFUL film! I saw the movie in 3D and at the 48fps that Jackson intended and I was blown away by how it looked. It's a stunning film that left me with the same 'WOW' factor that the original trilogy did a decade ago. Set 60 years earlier than Lord of The Rings, We are introduced to a much younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman). He is a content Hobbit, not concerned with adventure of any sort. Until Gandalf (Ian McKellan) suddenly appears, along with a group of unruly Dwarfs and offers Bilbo the chance to be part of a great adventure. The dwarfs wish to reclaim their homeland, which has been taken over by a huge dragon named Smaug, It's a simple concept and one that probably shouldn't be stretched over 3 movies but as with any 'first in a trilogy' film, it sets the stage perfectly. The movie has some great scenes.. meeting the Dwarfs in Bilbo's house, the run in with fighting stone giants and the escape from deep within the goblins' mountain are particular highlights. I loved the scene in which Bilbo runs into a familiar face (for LOTR fans) in the caves: Gollum (who looks amazing with todays MOCAP technology). Much of the movie, is the journey of the troupe back to the mountain, but also the journey of Bilbo himself.. mild and timid at the start of the film, our hero finds his courage, several times over, through the course of this film. \n\nOverall I loved this film, I thought it looked fantastic and the care of attention not just aesthetically but also in terms of continuity were obvious. These are Peter Jacksons films, no doubt. Much like he did with the previous trilogy, bringing us into a world full of heroes and villains, orcs and wizards this film literally (thanks to the 3D and FPS rate) literally transports you into Middle Earth.\n\nI am already excited to see the next instalment but to keep me satisfied until then..i may go and watch my LOTR boxset again .

As the movie opens, we get to know Mona, as she is making her way to work. Mona is a Norwegian diplomat meeting in London with the Palestine Minister of Finance, to convince him to take a leap of faith and open a "back channel" for secret negotiations with Israel. Mona's husband meanwhile is convincing the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister to do the same. In January of 1993, the parties arrive in Oslo... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the big screen adaptation of the Tony Award-winning stage play of the same name. The movie is directed by Tony Award-winning director Bartlett Sher, now venturing out into the movies. When reviewing a movie like this, it is not easy but nevertheless necessary to separate the merits of the movie from the merits of the subject matter of the movie. As to the movie itself, I was surprised how engaged I found myself with the movie. I have not seen the underlying theater play, but the sequencing and pacing of the movie is simply outstanding. The cast was mostly unknown to me, but the talent in the two leads (British actress Ruth Wilson and actor Andrew Scott) is undeniable. As to the subject matter of the movie (the Oslo Accords), with each passing year, one appreciates all the more the significant risks that were taken by the negotiators, and that real progress was made, only to see it all fall apart after the Oslo Accords were signed (in September, 1993). And look where the Israelis and Palestinians are now almost 30 years later. Nothing has been solved, and things are a LOT worse now than in the early 90s. Frankly, it's anyone's guess whether the Israeli-Palestine conflict can ever be solved at this point. And so the killings go on. There are several scenes in the movie that were hopeful, when the opposing negotiators saw each others as HUMANS, not just as Israeli or Palestine.

As the movie opens, we get to know Mona, as she is making her way to work. Mona is a Norwegian diplomat meeting in London with the Palestine Minister of Finance, to convince him to take a leap of faith and open a "back channel" for secret negotiations with Israel. Mona's husband meanwhile is convincing the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister to do the same. In January of 1993, the parties arrive in Oslo... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the big screen adaptation of the Tony Award-winning stage play of the same name. The movie is directed by Tony Award-winning director Bartlett Sher, now venturing out into the movies. When reviewing a movie like this, it is not easy but nevertheless necessary to separate the merits of the movie from the merits of the subject matter of the movie. As to the movie itself, I was surprised how engaged I found myself with the movie. I have not seen the underlying theater play, but the sequencing and pacing of the movie is simply outstanding. The cast was mostly unknown to me, but the talent in the two leads (British actress Ruth Wilson and actor Andrew Scott) is undeniable. As to the subject matter of the movie (the Oslo Accords), with each passing year, one appreciates all the more the significant risks that were taken by the negotiators, and that real progress was made, only to see it all fall apart after the Oslo Accords were signed (in September, 1993). And look where the Israelis and Palestinians are now almost 30 years later. Nothing has been solved, and things are a LOT worse now than in the early 90s. Frankly, it's anyone's guess whether the Israeli-Palestine conflict can ever be solved at this point. And so the killings go on. There are several scenes in the movie that were hopeful, when the opposing negotiators saw each others as HUMANS, not just as Israeli or Palestine. It filled my eyes with tears, knowing that these historical moments went for naught in the end. (For another take on this, make sure to check out the 2017 documentary "The Oslo Diaries", equally worth seeking out.)\n\n"Oslo" premiered on HBO a few days ago, and is now available on HBO On Demand (where I saw it tonight), HBO Max, and Amazon Instant Video.

There is tension in the air with Liberace's current paramour and performing partner Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne Jackson) and we soon discover that Liberace (impeccably played by Michael Douglas) only keeps his 'boys' around for a while before his manager Seymour (Dan Ackroyd) gets rid of them with a check.

He sets it in an era of fake news, fake history, disinformation. Propaganda at its best. Burn books and you can reinvent an alternative timeline.\n\nSet in a future Dystopia, Guy Montag (Michael P Jordan) and his mentor Captain Beatty (Michael Shannon) are firemen after a second civil war America who burn books, a tradition that goes far back as Benjamin Franklin! It is easier to control people if they could not find information and think for themselves. It was easy to keep people happy if they do not get offended from what they read.\n\nMontag carries out his work diligently and is in line for promotion but gets taken in by the Eels, a counter group who preserve the information contained in books.

He sets it in an era of fake news, fake history, disinformation. Propaganda at its best. Burn books and you can reinvent an alternative timeline.\n\nSet in a future Dystopia, Guy Montag (Michael P Jordan) and his mentor Captain Beatty (Michael Shannon) are firemen after a second civil war America who burn books, a tradition that goes far back as Benjamin Franklin! It is easier to control people if they could not find information and think for themselves. It was easy to keep people happy if they do not get offended from what they read.\n\nMontag carries out his work diligently and is in line for promotion but gets taken in by the Eels, a counter group who preserve the information contained in books. They learn books by heart, the upload it on the net, they rebel against the government.\n\nShannon can play the villain in his sleep. Jordan has the harder part but he is rather vacuous, maybe he is meant to be that way, a person who has never learned to think or question for himself.\n\nThere are some good ideas in this film but they never hang together or are fully realised.

At a large family homecoming Dan meets his perfect woman, only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother.\n\nWhat's a man to do?\n\nI rather liked "Dan In Real Life", but I would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept Steve Carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained, rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful. If you cannot accept it, fear not, "Get Smart" will be along later in the year, but for the record I thought he was very good.\n\n"Dan In Real Life" starts off like your typical, incidentally amusing, family drama, but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and Carell's frustration with his situation grows. It's not massively original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed, wouldn't they?), but "Dan In Real Life" is entertaining, and a good cast (who wouldn't fall in love at first sight with the luminous Juliette Binoche?) make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love.\n\nI hope that Steve Carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99884,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

At a large family homecoming Dan meets his perfect woman, only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother.\n\nWhat's a man to do?\n\nI rather liked "Dan In Real Life", but I would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept Steve Carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained, rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful. If you cannot accept it, fear not, "Get Smart" will be along later in the year, but for the record I thought he was very good.\n\n"Dan In Real Life" starts off like your typical, incidentally amusing, family drama, but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and Carell's frustration with his situation grows. It's not massively original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed, wouldn't they?), but "Dan In Real Life" is entertaining, and a good cast (who wouldn't fall in love at first sight with the luminous Juliette Binoche?) make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love.\n\nI hope that Steve Carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99884,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"teenage girl,game,young girl,gymnasium,new york city","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dan in Real Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi414318873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg3NDExMTA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA4ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Dan in Real Life trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0168855/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307070/","name":"Pierce Gardner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0373282/","name":"Peter Hedges"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco, Riley is directed by her emotions, Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) in Headquarters Control Center inside Riley's mind to help her overcome everyday life. However, Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to Riley's new life in San Francisco and emotional disorder arises.

China needs to get over itself and the US needs to stop being so friggin' and closed-minded with what people want to see in their theaters.\n\nThis story is absolutely deserving of an audience, and combines together through a beautiful lens a clashing of Western &amp; Eastern philosophies of life that really should be examined.\n\nAmericans have an idea of preserving one's independence and pressing back against being a cog in a machine, while China embraces being a cog and working together to ensure each other's safety and well-being. Both are philosophies that deserve meditation, and this movie does just that, while centering it around the touching story in the center between a grandmother and her family.\n\nI cannot give this movie enough praise. Each moment, each shot, each sound, each setting, each performance-- all orchestrated together seamlessly, giving the viewer an impartially guided experience full of subtle subtext and nuance that, if it doesn't get caught by the viewer, they at least get a gorgeous shot to enjoy.\n\nI was hesitant to give this movie ten stars, as I typically reserve that for movies that I would undoubtedly purchase and watch on repeat, but I could see myself watching this again and being in the mood for its ride. It's a bittersweet odyssey that dips and rises multiple times through darkness and light, all the while keeping you comforted with humor and grace-- almost like a grandmother should.\n\nTen stars for The Farewell.

Beautiful. Human.","reviewBody":"Good god, what is wrong with producers when they think this movie isn't worth making? China needs to get over itself and the US needs to stop being so friggin' and closed-minded with what people want to see in their theaters.\n\nThis story is absolutely deserving of an audience, and combines together through a beautiful lens a clashing of Western &amp; Eastern philosophies of life that really should be examined.\n\nAmericans have an idea of preserving one's independence and pressing back against being a cog in a machine, while China embraces being a cog and working together to ensure each other's safety and well-being. Both are philosophies that deserve meditation, and this movie does just that, while centering it around the touching story in the center between a grandmother and her family.\n\nI cannot give this movie enough praise. Each moment, each shot, each sound, each setting, each performance-- all orchestrated together seamlessly, giving the viewer an impartially guided experience full of subtle subtext and nuance that, if it doesn't get caught by the viewer, they at least get a gorgeous shot to enjoy.\n\nI was hesitant to give this movie ten stars, as I typically reserve that for movies that I would undoubtedly purchase and watch on repeat, but I could see myself watching this again and being in the mood for its ride. It's a bittersweet odyssey that dips and rises multiple times through darkness and light, all the while keeping you comforted with humor and grace-- almost like a grandmother should.\n\nTen stars for The Farewell. I will visit it again and again as I would my grandmother.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57094,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-09","keywords":"cemetery,doctor,grief,lie,secret","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1239464985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJkYjY1OGYtZGFjMy00ZDkyLTg2OWItMzRmYTc5MzE5MzgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJkYjY1OGYtZGFjMy00ZDkyLTg2OWItMzRmYTc5MzE5MzgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Chinese family discover their grandmother has only a short while left to live and decide to keep her in the dark, scheduling a wedding to gather before she dies.

Now years later, Jack is spiralling down, triggered by an unspeakable loss, and drowning in the alcoholism that cost him his marriage and any hope for a better life. When he is asked to coach the basketball team at his alma mater, which has fallen far since his glory days, he reluctantly accepts, surprising no one more than himself.

There are a few lighter scenes, but &gt;80% of the movie is dramatic and played for an emotional punch.\n\nWorth a watch for Affeck's performance.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39325,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2020-03-06","keywords":"basketball,coach,alcoholism,basketball movie,widow","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2639839001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIzYmVkY2QtNTZlMy00MzE4LWE3NDktZWEzMGE2MjZmZmU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIzYmVkY2QtNTZlMy00MzE4LWE3NDktZWEzMGE2MjZmZmU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck) once had a life filled with promise. In high school, he was a basketball phenom with a full university scholarship, when suddenly, for reasons unknown, he walked away from the game, forfeiting his future. Now years later, Jack is spiralling down, triggered by an unspeakable loss, and drowning in the alcoholism that cost him his marriage and any hope for a better life. When he is asked to coach the basketball team at his alma mater, which has fallen far since his glory days, he reluctantly accepts, surprising no one more than himself. As the boys start to come together as a team and win, Jack may have finally found a reason to confront the demons that have derailed him.

I thought I'd get something suitable for an octogenarian lady who likes "nice" films with pretty people in them.\n\nWell, it turned out she'd seen it, and anyway she and my wife were off to a show at 8pm, so I'd have to watch it all by myself (a one night rental, you see).\n\nWe have a home theater set up with high quality HD projection and a large 12 foot screen... perfect for expansive Blu Ray vistas. I thought I'd get at least some Academy Award nominated eye candy out of Australia, if nothing else. Not being a big Kidman or Jackman fan, I was hoping some of the supporting roles would hold my attention.\n\nI was glad I could watch Australia alone, as it made my laughing out loud and the tears rolling down my face (sometimes simultaneously) less embarrassing.\n\nThis is a wonderful, sprawling, completely overdone, yet breathtakingly entertaining movie. I'm not interested in where it fits into the Baz Lurhmann body of work. I watched Australia for itself, as a one off experience... and the film delivers a cornucopia of cinema treats.\n\nBe warned: to enjoy Australia you have to suspend disbelief. That is a given. Don't look for a sensitive, subtle, academic treatment of the plight of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, redolent with citations, statistics and sober commentary. This film presents the situation crystallized around the story of one little boy, as a representative of the thousands who were removed from their mothers and fathers, destined for lives as domestic servants in white homes or as cheap workers on white cattle stations in the Northern Territory.\n\nLikewise, the depiction of the mystical Aboriginal holy man is not meant to be taken literally. To my mind, the director's intent was to bypass stuffy academia and get to the soul of the Aboriginal person's ties to the land, which after all go back tens of thousands of years. There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies, or Star Wars films, where the ability to rip out a beating human heart, magic stones that ensure prosperity, the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies, a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it, or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur. The same could be said of any of a thousand successful movies: the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, even Ghostbusters. They assume from the start that their viewers will willing to suspend disbelief. This film requires that too.\n\nOnce your disbelief is checked at the door, you can sit back and indulge yourself in Australia. It is a film about emotion, not a documentary. It's whether the emotional truth of the film, often melodramatically worn on the director's sleeve, can grab your own heart and allow you to wallow in it unashamadely.\n\nOther reviewers have said here that they were able to watch the whole film with rapt attention from beginning to end. I join those ranks, and proudly. There is hardly a moment when the action - emotional or actual - is not hitting you right between the eyes, be it the stunning vistas or the awful badness of the baddies, the tender first kiss between the Drover and Lady Sarah, or the razor's edge existence of the young "creamie" boy, Nullah, always on the run from the well-meaning but misguided authorities who would "breed the Aboriginal out of him".\n\nSure, there are some CGI sections that at first seem way over the top, even comic book-like in their execution. But I'm not sure these weren't intentional. I wonder whether they were deliberately done they way they were to reinforce the magical and mystical thrust of the story? Yes, in Australia there are elements and style quotations from scores of previous movies. It pays homage to Indiana Jones (all four of them), Out Of Africa, Star Wars, any of the great westerns, The African Queen, Pearl Harbour (yes, Darwin really was bombed by the Japanese just after Pearl Harbour, with great loss of life), even The Wizard Of Oz. The latter was used as a metaphor for the boy's journey from grim reality to a mystical land full of evil characters, good fairies and magic animals. When he finally gets to see the movie itself, I'll guarantee even the most hardened eye in the audience will be struggling to hold back a tear.\n\nThe music was an eclectic collage of emotional cues, from the original score, thru the Hollywood musical and on to Elgar's Variations, with jazz, swing and bobbysoxer dance themes in between. Why not? The visuals and the sound reinforced each other, reaching not for footnotable, citable truth but for emotional truth (which is what all good films have ever done).\n\nThis was a great film, completely contrary to my preconceived notions of what it would be like to watch. It receives from me just about the greatest accolade I can offer any move: it's one I know I will watch over and over again, and get more out of with every viewing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When he finally gets to see the movie itself, I'll guarantee even the most hardened eye in the audience will be struggling to hold back a tear.\n\nThe music was an eclectic collage of emotional cues, from the original score, thru the Hollywood musical and on to Elgar's Variations, with jazz, swing and bobbysoxer dance themes in between. Why not? The visuals and the sound reinforced each other, reaching not for footnotable, citable truth but for emotional truth (which is what all good films have ever done).\n\nThis was a great film, completely contrary to my preconceived notions of what it would be like to watch. It receives from me just about the greatest accolade I can offer any move: it's one I know I will watch over and over again, and get more out of with every viewing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"],"duration":"PT2H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Beautiful. Human.","reviewBody":"Good god, what is wrong with producers when they think this movie isn't worth making? China needs to get over itself and the US needs to stop being so friggin' and closed-minded with what people want to see in their theaters.\n\nThis story is absolutely deserving of an audience, and combines together through a beautiful lens a clashing of Western &amp; Eastern philosophies of life that really should be examined.\n\nAmericans have an idea of preserving one's independence and pressing back against being a cog in a machine, while China embraces being a cog and working together to ensure each other's safety and well-being. Both are philosophies that deserve meditation, and this movie does just that, while centering it around the touching story in the center between a grandmother and her family.\n\nI cannot give this movie enough praise. Each moment, each shot, each sound, each setting, each performance-- all orchestrated together seamlessly, giving the viewer an impartially guided experience full of subtle subtext and nuance that, if it doesn't get caught by the viewer, they at least get a gorgeous shot to enjoy.\n\nI was hesitant to give this movie ten stars, as I typically reserve that for movies that I would undoubtedly purchase and watch on repeat, but I could see myself watching this again and being in the mood for its ride. It's a bittersweet odyssey that dips and rises multiple times through darkness and light, all the while keeping you comforted with humor and grace-- almost like a grandmother should.\n\nTen stars for The Farewell. I will visit it again and again as I would my grandmother."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57094,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-09","keywords":"cemetery,doctor,grief,lie,secret","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1239464985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJkYjY1OGYtZGFjMy00ZDkyLTg2OWItMzRmYTc5MzE5MzgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJkYjY1OGYtZGFjMy00ZDkyLTg2OWItMzRmYTc5MzE5MzgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Chinese family discover their grandmother has only a short while left to live and decide to keep her in the dark, scheduling a wedding to gather before she dies.

Beautiful. Human.","reviewBody":"Good god, what is wrong with producers when they think this movie isn't worth making? China needs to get over itself and the US needs to stop being so friggin' and closed-minded with what people want to see in their theaters.\n\nThis story is absolutely deserving of an audience, and combines together through a beautiful lens a clashing of Western &amp; Eastern philosophies of life that really should be examined.\n\nAmericans have an idea of preserving one's independence and pressing back against being a cog in a machine, while China embraces being a cog and working together to ensure each other's safety and well-being. Both are philosophies that deserve meditation, and this movie does just that, while centering it around the touching story in the center between a grandmother and her family.\n\nI cannot give this movie enough praise. Each moment, each shot, each sound, each setting, each performance-- all orchestrated together seamlessly, giving the viewer an impartially guided experience full of subtle subtext and nuance that, if it doesn't get caught by the viewer, they at least get a gorgeous shot to enjoy.\n\nI was hesitant to give this movie ten stars, as I typically reserve that for movies that I would undoubtedly purchase and watch on repeat, but I could see myself watching this again and being in the mood for its ride. It's a bittersweet odyssey that dips and rises multiple times through darkness and light, all the while keeping you comforted with humor and grace-- almost like a grandmother should.\n\nTen stars for The Farewell. I will visit it again and again as I would my grandmother.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57094,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-09","keywords":"cemetery,doctor,grief,lie,secret","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1239464985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJkYjY1OGYtZGFjMy00ZDkyLTg2OWItMzRmYTc5MzE5MzgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJkYjY1OGYtZGFjMy00ZDkyLTg2OWItMzRmYTc5MzE5MzgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Chinese family discover their grandmother has only a short while left to live and decide to keep her in the dark, scheduling a wedding to gather before she dies.

Silly scenes or heartfelt, or both, the comedy never flags. It is one of those movies that long afterward you will be recalling scenes and laughing. The casting is perfect. William Defoe? Yes!

That is great comic writing.\n\nIt also has one of the best endings of any movies out there. For some reason, contemporary films are having a terribly difficult time with coming up with a satisfactory ending. Not "Mr. Bean's Vacation." It has an astonishingly goofy conclusion, one that Mel Brooks at the top of his form would have had a hard time equaling.\n\nI cannot recommend this movie enough, though I wish it had been longer.

It's incredibly entertaining and enjoyable for anyone. Pretty much everything is done in a very respectable manner, and the film hits greatness in the writing, direction, voice performances, and visual design.
