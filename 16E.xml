I had seen previews for this picture, but I'd say this exceeded my expectations, which isn't to say masterpiece, but it was certainly entertaining, and at about 90 minutes, didn't really overstay it's welcome. \n\nAs you might expect for this genre, it's quite gory, so don't go expecting a light 'R' rating. But if you can handle some bloodshed, no, make that a substantial amount of bloodshed - but perhaps I should add in a comic environment - there's some pretty funny stuff here. Woody Harreleson and Jesse Eisenberg make an amusing odd couple and Emma Stone was fine for this material, although she and Abigale Breslin had slightly less to do. \n\nI'm certainly no expert on the horror genre or the zombie sub-genre, but I can say that this wasn't as scary as Shaun of the Dead, in fact not very scary at all, I may have jumped back just a tiny bit a few times; however I may have laughed more. However I'm sure it does make a difference that I saw 'Shaun' alone on DVD, while 'Zombieland' I watched in a theater full of people laughing, clapping and cheering. \n\nLet's face it, you know what's going to happen in this flick, but I'm happy to say, plot conventions and all, this delivers enough laughs so if you know what you're getting into I doubt you'll regret laying down the price of admission for this sucker. Should you see it, see it opening night - if I haven't made it clear enough already, this is the kind of movie where the more enthusiastic people in the theater, the more fun it will be. And to end on a very positive note, 'Zombieland' does feature what just might go down in history as the best celebrity cameo of all time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":540788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2010-01-06","keywords":"zombie,amusement park,twinkie,on the road,actor playing himself","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The "Kick-Ass Girls" of Zombieland","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179635481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTc4Nzc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5MjI5Mg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTc4Nzc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5MjI5Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Zombieland featurette"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0251986/","name":"Jesse Eisenberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281508/","name":"Ruben Fleischer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142539/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1014201/","name":"Rhett Reese"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1116660/","name":"Paul Wernick"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A shy student trying to reach his family in Ohio, a gun-toting bruiser in search of the last Twinkie and a pair of sisters striving to get to an amusement park join forces in a trek across a zombie-filled America." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1156398/","name":"Zombieland","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MDg0NTQ1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA4Mjg3Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A shy student trying to reach his family in Ohio, a gun-toting bruiser in search of the last Twinkie and a pair of sisters striving to get to an amusement park join forces in a trek across a zombie-filled America.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1156398/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"akerdan","dateCreated":"2009-09-10","inLanguage":"English","name":"Actually quite fun","reviewBody":"I just was exiting the theater after seeing '9', which is also worth a look, when my friend and I were offered tickets to a preview screening of Zombieland, which began almost immediately. I had seen previews for this picture, but I'd say this exceeded my expectations, which isn't to say masterpiece, but it was certainly entertaining, and at about 90 minutes, didn't really overstay it's welcome. \n\nAs you might expect for this genre, it's quite gory, so don't go expecting a light 'R' rating. But if you can handle some bloodshed, no, make that a substantial amount of bloodshed - but perhaps I should add in a comic environment - there's some pretty funny stuff here. Woody Harreleson and Jesse Eisenberg make an amusing odd couple and Emma Stone was fine for this material, although she and Abigale Breslin had slightly less to do. \n\nI'm certainly no expert on the horror genre or the zombie sub-genre, but I can say that this wasn't as scary as Shaun of the Dead, in fact not very scary at all, I may have jumped back just a tiny bit a few times; however I may have laughed more. However I'm sure it does make a difference that I saw 'Shaun' alone on DVD, while 'Zombieland' I watched in a theater full of people laughing, clapping and cheering. \n\nLet's face it, you know what's going to happen in this flick, but I'm happy to say, plot conventions and all, this delivers enough laughs so if you know what you're getting into I doubt you'll regret laying down the price of admission for this sucker. Should you see it, see it opening night - if I haven't made it clear enough already, this is the kind of movie where the more enthusiastic people in the theater, the more fun it will be. And to end on a very positive note, 'Zombieland' does feature what just might go down in history as the best celebrity cameo of all time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":540788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2010-01-06","keywords":"zombie,amusement park,twinkie,on the road,actor playing himself","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The "Kick-Ass Girls" of Zombieland","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179635481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTc4Nzc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5MjI5Mg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTc4Nzc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5MjI5Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Zombieland featurette","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0251986/","name":"Jesse Eisenberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281508/","name":"Ruben Fleischer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142539/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1014201/","name":"Rhett Reese","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1116660/","name":"Paul Wernick"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If the story doesn't require major air or naval assets, a script disapproved of by the top brass can be convincingly brought to the screen.  Two examples - both true stories that the Pentagon didn't want to support - are "Men of Honor" reflecting the epidemic racism of the not-that-long-ago Navy and "Sgt. Bilko," a film portraying what some noncoms do to earn extra income (trust me, it's a true story: a real Sgt. Bilko worked (officially but not actually) for me when I was an Army officer.\n\nBut when you need lots of planes and ships, you gotta have official help. And few movies have gotten more assistance than the producer, director and cast of "The Final Countdown," now available on DVD,a sci-fi recruiting spectacular that features - on loan at taxpayer expense - the huge carrier U.S.S. Nimitz complete with crew.  Now that's cooperation!\n\nKirk Douglas skippers the supercarrier which is on Pacific Fleet maneuvers. On board as some sort of efficiency consultant is a young Martin Sheen, not yet ready for the West Wing.  A mysterious and never explained weather phenomenon grips the mighty floating air base and to the unfolding amazement of captain, officers and crew dawns the realization that the Nimitz in sailing not that far from Pearl Harbor on 6 December 1941.\n\nMeanwhile a U.S. senator, played by one of Hollywood's deservedly decorated war heroes, Charles Durning, is enjoying his yacht, also near Pearl, while dictating to his lovely secretary, Katharine Ross.  A brace of Japanese Zeroes sink the yacht, killing two passengers which then prompts the carrier C.O. to order trailing F-14 Tomcats to "splash" the "enemy."  Durning and Ross are rescued.  Without a word, this talented actor's face does a comical double-take when introduced to the ship's executive officer who just happens to be black (in 1941 a black navy man could only serve as a steward in the officers mess.  That was it.  Period.)\n\nThe dilemma facing Douglas, of course, is a classic time-travel conundrum. To interfere with the course of history (the carrier's air wing can make instant teriyaki of the six Japanese carriers) or to let events take their known and disastrous course.\n\nA chaste incipient romance between the nearly drowned damsel and the carrier's Commander Air Group competes with the white knuckle decision-making struggle of the C.O.\n\nSo much for the plot.  What is on offer here is a demonstration of every aircraft type, fixed-wing and rotary, deployed on the vessel as well as demonstrations of shipboard activities ranging from retrieving a damaged jet to going to General Quarters to...you name it.  The technical advisers knew they had a film crew pliant to every suggestion.  The result is a genuinely exciting show- a great warship going through its paces.  And, unlike "Tora Tora Tora" it doesn't appear that any genuine sailors were harmed in the making of the movie.\n\nThere's one big problem.  A science fiction story is usually utterly improbable, indeed impossible, but its internal logic is vital: it must be consistent.  Spielberg understands that very well.  Watch the first couple of minutes when Sheen is greeted by his employer's lackey and the last minutes when he debarks from the Nimitz.  Something is very, very off-kilter. Could the CEO of a great military-industrial conglomerate have used top secret technology to send the carrier back to 1941 for...\n\nSo what.  This is a beautifully filmed adventure story, not a great film. The cast probably relished taking over the carrier for a while and the real captain, never shown, surely wished that the Navy hadn't banned hard spirits from our ships in World War I.  But all emerge unscathed in a genuinely entertaining romp through time.\n\n8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22736,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1980-08-01","keywords":"time travel into the past,aircraft carrier,time travel,tragedy,japanese abroad","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2724838937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdkZWMxYmUtMmJkZS00ZTY0LWI2YzAtZDk0ZTQ0YmYzZTBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdkZWMxYmUtMmJkZS00ZTY0LWI2YzAtZDk0ZTQ0YmYzZTBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000018/","name":"Kirk Douglas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000640/","name":"Martin Sheen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001684/","name":"Katharine Ross"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852279/","name":"Don Taylor"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068126/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0729297/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073529/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0403065/","name":"Thomas Hunter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0694268/","name":"Peter Powell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024388/","name":"David Ambrose"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If the story doesn't require major air or naval assets, a script disapproved of by the top brass can be convincingly brought to the screen.  Two examples - both true stories that the Pentagon didn't want to support - are "Men of Honor" reflecting the epidemic racism of the not-that-long-ago Navy and "Sgt. Bilko," a film portraying what some noncoms do to earn extra income (trust me, it's a true story: a real Sgt. Bilko worked (officially but not actually) for me when I was an Army officer.\n\nBut when you need lots of planes and ships, you gotta have official help. And few movies have gotten more assistance than the producer, director and cast of "The Final Countdown," now available on DVD,a sci-fi recruiting spectacular that features - on loan at taxpayer expense - the huge carrier U.S.S. Nimitz complete with crew.  Now that's cooperation!\n\nKirk Douglas skippers the supercarrier which is on Pacific Fleet maneuvers. On board as some sort of efficiency consultant is a young Martin Sheen, not yet ready for the West Wing.  A mysterious and never explained weather phenomenon grips the mighty floating air base and to the unfolding amazement of captain, officers and crew dawns the realization that the Nimitz in sailing not that far from Pearl Harbor on 6 December 1941.\n\nMeanwhile a U.S. senator, played by one of Hollywood's deservedly decorated war heroes, Charles Durning, is enjoying his yacht, also near Pearl, while dictating to his lovely secretary, Katharine Ross.  A brace of Japanese Zeroes sink the yacht, killing two passengers which then prompts the carrier C.O. to order trailing F-14 Tomcats to "splash" the "enemy."  Durning and Ross are rescued.  Without a word, this talented actor's face does a comical double-take when introduced to the ship's executive officer who just happens to be black (in 1941 a black navy man could only serve as a steward in the officers mess.  That was it.  Period.)\n\nThe dilemma facing Douglas, of course, is a classic time-travel conundrum. To interfere with the course of history (the carrier's air wing can make instant teriyaki of the six Japanese carriers) or to let events take their known and disastrous course.\n\nA chaste incipient romance between the nearly drowned damsel and the carrier's Commander Air Group competes with the white knuckle decision-making struggle of the C.O.\n\nSo much for the plot.  What is on offer here is a demonstration of every aircraft type, fixed-wing and rotary, deployed on the vessel as well as demonstrations of shipboard activities ranging from retrieving a damaged jet to going to General Quarters to...you name it.  The technical advisers knew they had a film crew pliant to every suggestion.  The result is a genuinely exciting show- a great warship going through its paces.  And, unlike "Tora Tora Tora" it doesn't appear that any genuine sailors were harmed in the making of the movie.\n\nThere's one big problem.  A science fiction story is usually utterly improbable, indeed impossible, but its internal logic is vital: it must be consistent.  Spielberg understands that very well.  Watch the first couple of minutes when Sheen is greeted by his employer's lackey and the last minutes when he debarks from the Nimitz.  Something is very, very off-kilter. Could the CEO of a great military-industrial conglomerate have used top secret technology to send the carrier back to 1941 for...\n\nSo what.  This is a beautifully filmed adventure story, not a great film. The cast probably relished taking over the carrier for a while and the real captain, never shown, surely wished that the Navy hadn't banned hard spirits from our ships in World War I.  But all emerge unscathed in a genuinely entertaining romp through time.\n\n8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22736,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1980-08-01","keywords":"time travel into the past,aircraft carrier,time travel,tragedy,japanese abroad","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2724838937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdkZWMxYmUtMmJkZS00ZTY0LWI2YzAtZDk0ZTQ0YmYzZTBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdkZWMxYmUtMmJkZS00ZTY0LWI2YzAtZDk0ZTQ0YmYzZTBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000018/","name":"Kirk Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000640/","name":"Martin Sheen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001684/","name":"Katharine Ross"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852279/","name":"Don Taylor"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068126/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0729297/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073529/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0403065/","name":"Thomas Hunter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0694268/","name":"Peter Powell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024388/","name":"David Ambrose"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Way to go, Jim.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":286784,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1994-02-04","keywords":"stupidity,nudity,detective,owner dog relationship,master dog relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3562847001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAyMGUyOGMtNThjNC00ODM0LWI0M2ItNmI1NGExMmMyN2U0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAyMGUyOGMtNThjNC00ODM0LWI0M2ItNmI1NGExMmMyN2U0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A goofy detective specializing in animals goes in search of the missing mascot of the Miami Dolphins.

I think that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is a rip-off of SCREAM, but a rip-off that can be enjoyed. Plots are similar, but not identical. It also has the similar pretty-teenager-being-stabbed-to-death feel to it.\n\nOn graduation night, four friends Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry Cox (Ryan Phillippe) and Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.) go joyriding while drunk and accidentally run over and supposedly kill somebody in the street. While dumping the body in a bay, the body attacks Barry, then falls into the water. The four assume that he is dead, but the next summer they get notes saying "I know what you did last summer". The next thing you know, friends of the four are being murdered left and right and these four become the killer's next targets.\n\nThe plot is fair, but not especially interesting. I found the SCREAM plot to be much better. The acting and character development in SCREAM are better too. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar both do excellent jobs. Freddie Prinze Jr. is the worst actor I've ever seen in my life, and Ryan Phillippe does a fair job. Ann Heche is very good in the part that she has.\n\nThe characters, aside from Hewitt, Gellar and Heche, are very thin and rather boring. The killer himself is pretty interesting and fairly cool. The ending of this movie bites. It's maybe worth a rent, but if you want to see a movie of this style I'd recommend URBAN LEGENDS or SCREAM.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1997-10-17","keywords":"stupid victim,taking a shower,teen slasher,teenage girl,slasher killer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"I Know What You Did Last Summer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi663666457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDBiYmQtZDJkNC00NjQxLTlkZWEtMzMyN2RkOTBkY2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDBiYmQtZDJkNC00NjQxLTlkZWEtMzMyN2RkOTBkY2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001349/","name":"Jennifer Love Hewitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001264/","name":"Sarah Michelle Gellar"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000162/","name":"Anne Heche"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0318947/","name":"Jim Gillespie"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033437/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147895/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0242028/","name":"Lois Duncan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0932078/","name":"Kevin Williamson"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: I Know What You Did Last Summer: Directed by Jim Gillespie. With Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, Freddie Prinze Jr..

I think that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is a rip-off of SCREAM, but a rip-off that can be enjoyed. Plots are similar, but not identical. It also has the similar pretty-teenager-being-stabbed-to-death feel to it.\n\nOn graduation night, four friends Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry Cox (Ryan Phillippe) and Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.) go joyriding while drunk and accidentally run over and supposedly kill somebody in the street. While dumping the body in a bay, the body attacks Barry, then falls into the water. The four assume that he is dead, but the next summer they get notes saying "I know what you did last summer". The next thing you know, friends of the four are being murdered left and right and these four become the killer's next targets.\n\nThe plot is fair, but not especially interesting. I found the SCREAM plot to be much better. The acting and character development in SCREAM are better too. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar both do excellent jobs. Freddie Prinze Jr. is the worst actor I've ever seen in my life, and Ryan Phillippe does a fair job. Ann Heche is very good in the part that she has.\n\nThe characters, aside from Hewitt, Gellar and Heche, are very thin and rather boring. The killer himself is pretty interesting and fairly cool. The ending of this movie bites. It's maybe worth a rent, but if you want to see a movie of this style I'd recommend URBAN LEGENDS or SCREAM.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1997-10-17","keywords":"stupid victim,taking a shower,teen slasher,teenage girl,slasher killer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"I Know What You Did Last Summer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi663666457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDBiYmQtZDJkNC00NjQxLTlkZWEtMzMyN2RkOTBkY2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDBiYmQtZDJkNC00NjQxLTlkZWEtMzMyN2RkOTBkY2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001349/","name":"Jennifer Love Hewitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001264/","name":"Sarah Michelle Gellar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000162/","name":"Anne Heche"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0318947/","name":"Jim Gillespie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033437/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147895/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0242028/","name":"Lois Duncan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0932078/","name":"Kevin Williamson"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

The movie is not a classic main stream super hero movie but a very nice parody making fun of the way super hero movies are made, emphasizing on their blank spots.

That's my takeaway from this movie. As other critics have stated, this is just one big infomercial for Steve Harvey's book. I will go a step further and say it's a big ol' "that-a-boy" from Steve to himself. Gag me now.\n\nThe plot is non-existent. The "movie" is just an array of vignettes that sloppily intersect and form silly lessons from the "great one" (Harvey) about relationships. The characters are just there. There is no real development except the trite, predictable "I see the light now" that brings the manufactured happy endings to each vignette. The writing is HORRIBLE. The production is low-budget. The list goes on of things that make this "movie" forgettable.\n\nHowever,there are small but significant peeps of light through the otherwise dark cloud that is this ode to Harvey. The all-star cast tries really hard and sometimes succeeds at making this horrible script entertaining. I will highlight Michael Ealy's character as a ray of sunshine. The combination of his looks including those piercing eyes and his acting chops make his character appealing and dreamy, despite his being mismatched with the older-looking Taraji Henson. Gabrielle Union does a decent job with her character and she and her beau have the most interesting, believable story line of the movie. The numerous cameos would be kind of cute if they didn't leave you with the impression that their inclusion is just yet another way for "the great one" to show he is "somebody" and that he "knows people." I digress as I find myself getting back to the negative even in the paragraph I had reserved to show the few positives of the movie.\n\nBottom line, this is an ego-driven "I love myself" fest of Steve Harvey. I am wholly disappointed in the Rainforest crew who produced it, as I thought they would have grown more in their movie-making than they have apparently. They are still putting out low-budget, poorly-constructed films. It seems the only difference is that they are getting paid more now to do so. It's a shame.

Chapter 2 does a great job of furthering itself  from the usual fare, by expanding on the elements that made it  different.  One on the elements of this franchise is the focus on "Astral  Projection", which is a person subconsciously leaving his/her body and  traveling though a spirit realm (called the "Further" in this movie),  leaving the body empty until the soul returns. While projecting, the  soul can interact with other spirits, good and bad. Chapter 2 picks  right up from where the first ended (SPOILER FOR THE 1ST MOVIE! SKIP TO  NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID!) - the father succeeds in rescuing his son's  soul, but something else has taken the father's body in the process.   Is it as scary as the first? That's debatable...if you liked the scares  from the first movie, then you'll get a kick out of some of the  tension- filled moments in this one. If you weren't a fan, then it'll  probably just be more of the same. My opinion - slightly fewer scary  moments, but definitely a few quality jumps, perhaps of a higher  quality than the first. (There's one 3-hit combo in particular that I  thought was really good.)  I will say that I enjoyed how the total story has evolved. Chapter 2  adds a few layers to the lore of this franchise that sparked my  interests, and gives it some good depth. The script is infinitely  better this time around. Patrick Wilson outdoes his previous  performance, and I love anything that Barbara Hershey does. We even get  a few laughs here and there. And James Wan does well to use the  'common-sense-as-viewers- applied-in-the-movie' technique again.  Without giving anything away...when you get a blatant warning, YOU  LISTEN TO IT.  Sound editing was much better this time around, although they still  rely a good amount on the usual dead silence broken by LOUD CRASHES OF  NOISE AND CREEPY MUSIC...  Overall, Chapter 2 makes several improvements on the first, and while,  depending on your tastes, this sequel may or may not be as scary as the  first, I think it's tough to deny that this is a all-around better,  more entertaining movie. And, being such a low-risk, low-budget  project, I'm sure a 3rd movie will be justified.  Insidious: Chapter 2 scores a 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":162621,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-09-13","keywords":"police detective,barricading a door,injection in leg,taser,attacked with a knife","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4286163225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg","description":"A haunted family struggles to uncover a terrifying secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world in Insidious: Chapter 2."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933940/","name":"Patrick Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001347/","name":"Barbara Hershey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314851/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0222021/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1191481/","name":"Leigh Whannell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Chapter 2 does a great job of furthering itself  from the usual fare, by expanding on the elements that made it  different.  One on the elements of this franchise is the focus on "Astral  Projection", which is a person subconsciously leaving his/her body and  traveling though a spirit realm (called the "Further" in this movie),  leaving the body empty until the soul returns. While projecting, the  soul can interact with other spirits, good and bad. Chapter 2 picks  right up from where the first ended (SPOILER FOR THE 1ST MOVIE! SKIP TO  NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID!) - the father succeeds in rescuing his son's  soul, but something else has taken the father's body in the process.   Is it as scary as the first? That's debatable...if you liked the scares  from the first movie, then you'll get a kick out of some of the  tension- filled moments in this one. If you weren't a fan, then it'll  probably just be more of the same. My opinion - slightly fewer scary  moments, but definitely a few quality jumps, perhaps of a higher  quality than the first. (There's one 3-hit combo in particular that I  thought was really good.)  I will say that I enjoyed how the total story has evolved. Chapter 2  adds a few layers to the lore of this franchise that sparked my  interests, and gives it some good depth. The script is infinitely  better this time around. Patrick Wilson outdoes his previous  performance, and I love anything that Barbara Hershey does. We even get  a few laughs here and there. And James Wan does well to use the  'common-sense-as-viewers- applied-in-the-movie' technique again.  Without giving anything away...when you get a blatant warning, YOU  LISTEN TO IT.  Sound editing was much better this time around, although they still  rely a good amount on the usual dead silence broken by LOUD CRASHES OF  NOISE AND CREEPY MUSIC...  Overall, Chapter 2 makes several improvements on the first, and while,  depending on your tastes, this sequel may or may not be as scary as the  first, I think it's tough to deny that this is a all-around better,  more entertaining movie. And, being such a low-risk, low-budget  project, I'm sure a 3rd movie will be justified.  Insidious: Chapter 2 scores a 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":162621,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-09-13","keywords":"police detective,barricading a door,injection in leg,taser,attacked with a knife","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4286163225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg","description":"A haunted family struggles to uncover a terrifying secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world in Insidious: Chapter 2.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933940/","name":"Patrick Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001347/","name":"Barbara Hershey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314851/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0222021/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1191481/","name":"Leigh Whannell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This film keeps the audience entertained by providing many other side plots. One example is a story about a young atheist, who is diagnosed with cancer and follows her journey to come to terms with her fate and find Christianity. My favorite part of the movie is its theme of showing that one shouldn't force anything on anyone, which is why Josh chose to stand up for himself. I felt like Josh supports this theme, but he never proved that God was real. The biggest problem that I had with the movie is that it seems to make Christianity sound like the best religion by having all of the atheists and people of other religions in the movie seems like total jerks or have something bad happen to them. Professor Radisson, an atheist, seems like a jerk because they constantly have him threatening to ruin Josh's career, and ends up getting hit by a car. They also make the father of a Muslim girl a terrible person because he hits and kicks out his daughter for wanting to be Christian. At the end of the movie, they also showed a message telling the audience to send 'God's not dead' to all of the contacts in their phone. I understand that this movie is meant for Christian audiences but it was still overly biased. Overall, I enjoyed the plot of the movie and its theme. However, I felt as if it was trying to force Christianity on me.

I think this movie is worth to watch and people should forget about the first one. This might be the first time that the sequel is better than the first movie. I did a movie review on The Nut Job 2 on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Fdl_pi2_E) I am proud of the directors for making the second one better, the animators did a great job with the animation and I can't wait for a third one.

The family's best-known member today is Maria's aunt Adele, whose portrait Gustav Klimt painted in 1907. The painting was appropriated during the Nazi era and for many years hung in the Austrian state's famous Belvedere Gallery, as "the Mona Lisa of Vienna." After her sister's death, Maria finds correspondence suggesting the painting was perhaps not left to the government of Austria in her aunt's will, as it claimed, and therefore not rightfully Austrian property. She hires a family friend's son, Randol Schoenberg (played by Ryan Reynolds), a young down-on-his-luck Los Angeles attorney, to look into the matter. Schoenberg, grandson of the composer—another refugee from Nazified Austria—is out of touch with his family's past and slow to recognize the significance of Maria's quest. Initially unwilling to take on the case, he is gradually drawn into it. Their bureaucratic battles with stonewalling Austrian officials soon unite the pair, and they are joined by a crusading Austrian journalist, Hubertus Czernin. Formidable legal and bureaucratic hurdles stand in the way of Maria being reuniting with the painting—"When you look at this painting, you see a work of art," Marie tells a reunification commission, "I see my aunt." The story is another in a long line of mostly not happy stories of stolen art works in World War II, brought to renewed public awareness by movies and books like The Monuments Men and Pictures at an Exhibition. The opportunity to reunite beloved works of art and their owners is rapidly disappearing, yet this beautifully filmed movie, directed by Simon Curtis, shows the importance of continuing these efforts. Because this film is based on a true story, and I for one remembered how it ends, a certain inevitability about the outcome guides the plot. Perhaps this is what has caused reviewers (not me!) to find it dull, though they find the actors captivating. As a result of the strong positive audience reception, the film's distributor will greatly expand its national distribution. If you like stories that touch on beauty, truth, and justice, you will like it, too!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":56150,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-04-10","keywords":"justice,austrian history,holocaust,art museum,looting","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi278572569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjQ4MzMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMzNDUxNDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjQ4MzMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMzNDUxNDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Sixty years after she fled Vienna during World War II, an elderly Jewish woman, Maria Altmann, starts her journey to retrieve family possessions seized by the Nazis, among them Klimt's famous painting 'The Lady in Gold'.

The family's best-known member today is Maria's aunt Adele, whose portrait Gustav Klimt painted in 1907. The painting was appropriated during the Nazi era and for many years hung in the Austrian state's famous Belvedere Gallery, as "the Mona Lisa of Vienna." After her sister's death, Maria finds correspondence suggesting the painting was perhaps not left to the government of Austria in her aunt's will, as it claimed, and therefore not rightfully Austrian property. She hires a family friend's son, Randol Schoenberg (played by Ryan Reynolds), a young down-on-his-luck Los Angeles attorney, to look into the matter. Schoenberg, grandson of the composer—another refugee from Nazified Austria—is out of touch with his family's past and slow to recognize the significance of Maria's quest. Initially unwilling to take on the case, he is gradually drawn into it. Their bureaucratic battles with stonewalling Austrian officials soon unite the pair, and they are joined by a crusading Austrian journalist, Hubertus Czernin. Formidable legal and bureaucratic hurdles stand in the way of Maria being reuniting with the painting—"When you look at this painting, you see a work of art," Marie tells a reunification commission, "I see my aunt." The story is another in a long line of mostly not happy stories of stolen art works in World War II, brought to renewed public awareness by movies and books like The Monuments Men and Pictures at an Exhibition. The opportunity to reunite beloved works of art and their owners is rapidly disappearing, yet this beautifully filmed movie, directed by Simon Curtis, shows the importance of continuing these efforts. Because this film is based on a true story, and I for one remembered how it ends, a certain inevitability about the outcome guides the plot. Perhaps this is what has caused reviewers (not me!) to find it dull, though they find the actors captivating. As a result of the strong positive audience reception, the film's distributor will greatly expand its national distribution. If you like stories that touch on beauty, truth, and justice, you will like it, too!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":56150,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-04-10","keywords":"justice,austrian history,holocaust,art museum,looting","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi278572569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjQ4MzMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMzNDUxNDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjQ4MzMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMzNDUxNDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Sixty years after she fled Vienna during World War II, an elderly Jewish woman, Maria Altmann, starts her journey to retrieve family possessions seized by the Nazis, among them Klimt's famous painting 'The Lady in Gold'.

Outwardly, the film is a story about the painter and a household maid who becomes the subject of the painting. Inwardly, the film is about the unspoken but palpable feelings between two people of very different stature and station which may or may not be forever cast in the crazed pigments of the masterpiece. Those who can tap into the subtle human emotional undercurrents will find this film far more satisfying than those who cannot. Regardless, all will find "Girl with a Pearl Earring" a masterpiece of filmmaking.

I'm a bit shocked at some of your reviews here because I don't think many of you know much about the period. I do. To boot, I'm gay. Julianne Moore is excellent and deserving of the acclaim she's received for this role, as well as Quaid in the supporting role. The thing I think most people missed (or haven't made much comment on) is that both Kathleen and Frank are victims of heart-felt emotions at a time when expressing them is unthinkable. They are equally challenged by simple and earnest desires to "fill the void" in their lives: Kathleen with her giant colorblind heart in a cold society of bigots and Frank in his corporate supremacy and his "It's a different kind of love, Charlie Brown" headache. One reviewer said Frank was abusive, closeted (sure, obviously, duh) and an alcoholic. I guess if you'd ever been through that type of situation you might be a bit more forgiving because it is hell and I came from the 50s so trust. Each of these obviously well-developed characters is simply doing the best they can in a world where their ground-breaking feelings are out of place. I loved it. I own it. And I, clearly, do not advise that slim minds or socially challenged people attempt it.

I'm a bit shocked at some of your reviews here because I don't think many of you know much about the period. I do. To boot, I'm gay. Julianne Moore is excellent and deserving of the acclaim she's received for this role, as well as Quaid in the supporting role. The thing I think most people missed (or haven't made much comment on) is that both Kathleen and Frank are victims of heart-felt emotions at a time when expressing them is unthinkable. They are equally challenged by simple and earnest desires to "fill the void" in their lives: Kathleen with her giant colorblind heart in a cold society of bigots and Frank in his corporate supremacy and his "It's a different kind of love, Charlie Brown" headache. One reviewer said Frank was abusive, closeted (sure, obviously, duh) and an alcoholic. I guess if you'd ever been through that type of situation you might be a bit more forgiving because it is hell and I came from the 50s so trust. Each of these obviously well-developed characters is simply doing the best they can in a world where their ground-breaking feelings are out of place. I loved it. I own it. And I, clearly, do not advise that slim minds or socially challenged people attempt it. However, if you can watch a movie and not be a judge, if you can accept things not from your time and not about you but about very, very grand new ideas, it's an extremely well-made, well-acted and accurate film. I personally forgot we had so much orange and green furniture.

It features beautiful cinematography, even for those who don't particularly care about such things, and winning performances by Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, at its heart, is not a movie about fish at all; it is about different kinds of faith and the degree to which people place their trust in them. Alfred Jones (McGregor) is an expert in all things ichthyic and works for the UK's version of the Department of the Interior. He is approached by the representative of a idealistic sheikh who loves to fish. The sheikh has it in his head that bringing the art of fly fishing for salmon to the Yemen River would be beneficial to his people (the river is dried up in places and is, obviously, in the middle of a desert). It is not a popular idea, and Jones, before and after taking a perfunctory meeting with Harriet, dismisses it as ludicrous, unsound, and downright absurd. (Dr. Jones is a bit of a straight arrow, you see.) And it would seem that would be the end of it, except that the Prime Minister's press secretary (Kristin Scott Thomas) sees this as an opportunity to foster Arab-Anglo relations at a time when, well, they're not so good. Long story short – Jones has to make the project work.\n\nThere are many obstacles to overcome. The water must be the right temperature and with the right amount of oxygen. Fish have to be found, somewhere, and imported. Negotiations must be had with local tribes who feel that bringing water to the desert is an abomination of some sort. And meanwhile, pressure mounts and mounts for Jones to pull it all off, since the sheikh is paying handsomely to the British government.\n\nAlfred – Fred – and Harriet each have home lives that are in their own unique turmoil. Fred has been married for several years with no children, and it's clear that the love he and his wife once shared in full has dwindled considerably; she suddenly takes a job in Geneva, promising to visit him every so often. As for Harriet, the first man she has fallen for is suddenly deployed to Afghanistan. Each takes solace in their Yemen project.\n\nWhat works best in this movie is the chemistry between Blunt and McGregor; the former plays an optimist ready for new challenges, and the latter is more of a stick-in-the-mud with little sense of humor. Okay, you who are reading this know that this is a plain setup, as this is not just a drama: it a romantic drama. Luckily for all of us, the movie doesn't descend into double entendres, sideward glances, awkward silences, and the like. Blunt and McGregor manage to avoid making the romance too light, too believable; we shouldn't be able to easily guess precisely how things will wind up, and we can't. Theirs is a working relationship that neither acknowledges as being anything but, and each is torn between their subconscious feelings for each other and for their respective significant others.\n\nAt one point, the sheikh asks Jones if he is a man of faith, and the expert replies that he is not. The sheikh rightly points out, however, that fishing itself relies on faith – the hope that something will occur, however improbable. A man puts a lure into the water. The outcome is not predetermined; he will most likely reel it in untouched. But he has faith that a fish will nibble at it and take the bait. The sheikh feels the same way about his fishing project. He has faith that doing so will enable the poor communities surrounding the river to thrive.\n\nIn the end, this is a quiet, elegant movie about love and hope, both of fishing and humanity. Excellent performances by the leads and able direction by Hallstrom make this a sort of soft-edged drama with romance and a bit of action.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":63397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2012-04-20","keywords":"salmon,fishing,fish,desert,dam","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3792806169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3OTE1MzMyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg2NTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3OTE1MzMyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg2NTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An expert is approached by a consultant to help realize a sheik's vision of bringing the sport of fly-fishing to the desert and embark son an upstream journey of faith and fish to prove the impossible, possible."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1289434/","name":"Emily Blunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0906756/","name":"Amr Waked"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002120/","name":"Lasse Hallström"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104811/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047306/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064479/","name":"Simon Beaufoy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3468186/","name":"Paul Torday"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6394365/","name":"Fuad Al-Qrize"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You don't watch a movie - you experience a real time and place. I happen to love a bunch of Paul Newman's films (The 3 H's - Hud, Hombre and Harper; Cool Hand Luke; The Sting; The Hustler; The Color of Money...), but I'm not what you'd call a rabid fan. I think he is compelling, but has a fairly limited range. He is perfect in this role, but it isn't much different from The Hustler or Cool Hand Luke. However, watching Melvyn Douglas is like watching somebody that Marty Ritt pulled off of some ranch and filmed in his daily life. His performance is absolutely dead- on. The gravelly drawl, the old boy shuffle, his expression - the way his eyes take in the landscape or gaze intently into a bowl of ice cream while Hud talks - all incredibly REAL! I KNOW those old guys!\n\nMelvyn Douglas is a truly under-appreciated American acting genius whose career spanned over 5 decades. His range is tremendous. This is the same honey-tongued actor who is the perfect comic foil to Garbo's Ninotchka in the '30's (In fact, he is one of her only REPEAT leading men!) And his bluster-filled performance in I Never Sang for My Father (with another modern great, Gene Hackman) is also out of this world!

You don't watch a movie - you experience a real time and place. I happen to love a bunch of Paul Newman's films (The 3 H's - Hud, Hombre and Harper; Cool Hand Luke; The Sting; The Hustler; The Color of Money...), but I'm not what you'd call a rabid fan. I think he is compelling, but has a fairly limited range. He is perfect in this role, but it isn't much different from The Hustler or Cool Hand Luke. However, watching Melvyn Douglas is like watching somebody that Marty Ritt pulled off of some ranch and filmed in his daily life. His performance is absolutely dead- on. The gravelly drawl, the old boy shuffle, his expression - the way his eyes take in the landscape or gaze intently into a bowl of ice cream while Hud talks - all incredibly REAL! I KNOW those old guys!\n\nMelvyn Douglas is a truly under-appreciated American acting genius whose career spanned over 5 decades. His range is tremendous. This is the same honey-tongued actor who is the perfect comic foil to Garbo's Ninotchka in the '30's (In fact, he is one of her only REPEAT leading men!) And his bluster-filled performance in I Never Sang for My Father (with another modern great, Gene Hackman) is also out of this world!

However, this movie gives a brutal insight into some meaningless and worthless lives, of which plenty exists in our world. It is wonderfully played and directed, while the storyline sticks to the real stigma of low-life, survival, and struggle.\n\nWhy am I writing this? I was only 17-years old when I was desperate to escape a wretched child and youthhood. Back then, I met a woman who made me feel comfortable, loved an understood; never mind she was 6 years my senior and was mother to three children from her first marriage. I fell for her - and failed but struggled on for an unbelievable 45 years.\n\nIf some state here that this movie is nothing more than a 'wandering tale', than I dare to argue that that is what life is. Life is not fixed, nor does it proceed steadily. There are always difficulties, arguments, disagreements, and struggles. Even more so when people hit the lows and must live with little or no prospects. However, life can get compelling and testing when relationships evolve that have not much hope from the outset.\n\nThis movie leads the viewer in a very realistic surround of financial and relational struggles. To intensify the story, Weyland (Pablo) plays a character who was just released from prison after 15 years, meaning he would have had no real prospects of getting a fair chance or a decent job. Indeed, that gives the story another edge while leading the viewer in a world, 'normal' people cannot relate to.\n\nOverall, it is a movie worth watching. It may seem boring for some, but others may find some resemblances to their own lives, past or present.

The act that you can guess what is coming next is probably what keeps you watching. Most of the storytelling is delivered with tongue in cheek humor while people are dying right left and center. The baddies are super smart, the good guys and authorities totally inept except the heroes and the result is Hallmark.

What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix's acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. 'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone. You will benefit from it's message and it's wonderful acting.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":380619,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1986-08-22","keywords":"friendship,childhood,coming of age film,walking on train tracks,summertime","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stand By Me","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2284829721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1NmQ5YWUtMmU2OC00MzQ0LWE4YmYtYTFmNWM2ZmUxYWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1NmQ5YWUtMmU2OC00MzQ0LWE4YmYtYTFmNWM2ZmUxYWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000696/","name":"Wil Wheaton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000203/","name":"River Phoenix"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000397/","name":"Corey Feldman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001661/","name":"Rob Reiner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015549/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043140/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000175/","name":"Stephen King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0317279/","name":"Raynold Gideon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0262595/","name":"Bruce A.

What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix's acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. 'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone. You will benefit from it's message and it's wonderful acting.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":380619,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1986-08-22","keywords":"friendship,childhood,coming of age film,walking on train tracks,summertime","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stand By Me","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2284829721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1NmQ5YWUtMmU2OC00MzQ0LWE4YmYtYTFmNWM2ZmUxYWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1NmQ5YWUtMmU2OC00MzQ0LWE4YmYtYTFmNWM2ZmUxYWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000696/","name":"Wil Wheaton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000203/","name":"River Phoenix","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000397/","name":"Corey Feldman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001661/","name":"Rob Reiner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015549/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043140/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000175/","name":"Stephen King","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0317279/","name":"Raynold Gideon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0262595/","name":"Bruce A.

I am watching with someone who is hard of hearing and has to mostly read the script. Last night they were talking of furniture in the French Louis XV style. It is always read as Louis the fifteenth or often in French Quinze (pronounced cans - and that is exactly what the close caption said in the style of Louis cans - I had to explain that one to my mom!) Then a few moments later, Miss Marple talked about the problem of yarn balls vs skeins, except the close caption said yarn scans. So confusing for the reader. There are mistakes and horrible scripting throughout almost every episode.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6990,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-12-12","keywords":"united kingdom,murder,detective,female detective,england","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568603/","name":"Geraldine McEwan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571549/","name":"Julia McKenzie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161410/","name":"Stephen Churchett"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104279/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103605/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041824/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Agatha Christie's Marple: The Julia McKenzie Collection","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4158173977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA0OWUwNDEtNjBmMS00OTQ4LThmOWItYTBkNDY4M2RhYWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA0OWUwNDEtNjBmMS00OTQ4LThmOWItYTBkNDY4M2RhYWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Agatha Christie's Marple: The Julia McKenzie Collection"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I loved seeing Morris Chesnut in a role where he really shines. The fact that he's gorgeous is not relative to his character, an overly optimistic, happy-go-lucky pain in Villa's butt.I didn't feel like that was overly played, some viewers Posed his character as cocky because he mentions himself in quirky ways, but it's actually a play on his sarcastic comedy. The show in and of itself is nothing to write home about, a basic pairing of mixed gender characters with a love/hate relationship (that will more than likely veer into a romantic direction- let us all pray not) who want to avoid admitting the obvious fact that they work well together and are made for each other. This has been done repeatedly and frankly beat over viewers heads when mixed with the typical cop, CSI drama. However, the mixture of Villa and Rosie's characters are nice and their acting both together and individually is growing on me with every episode.I love the positive family atmosphere and feel that all the supporting actors do well with each other and at holding their own. I feel the show is a refreshing break from the dark, high-paced, slapstick comedy, reality hungry barrage of television we've been reduced to. It's clean, it's funny, it's cultural and it's light. That deserves a well done in my book! Personal hopes for the show: they keep Villa's and Rosie's relationship friendly. They bring back Nicole Ari Parker as his love interest (that was a lame excuse for a break up!), they continue to advance the cases they work on to be more interesting.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7389,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2015-09-23","keywords":"laboratory,pathologist,deduction,heart condition,miami florida","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004820/","name":"Morris Chestnut"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1632786/","name":"Jaina Lee Ortiz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827488/","name":"Gabrielle Dennis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069651/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0555624/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1029960/","name":"Todd Harthan"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3235099417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2MDc5ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1NzQ1NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2MDc5ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1NzQ1NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official trailer for Rosewood on Fox."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I loved seeing Morris Chesnut in a role where he really shines. The fact that he's gorgeous is not relative to his character, an overly optimistic, happy-go-lucky pain in Villa's butt.I didn't feel like that was overly played, some viewers Posed his character as cocky because he mentions himself in quirky ways, but it's actually a play on his sarcastic comedy. The show in and of itself is nothing to write home about, a basic pairing of mixed gender characters with a love/hate relationship (that will more than likely veer into a romantic direction- let us all pray not) who want to avoid admitting the obvious fact that they work well together and are made for each other. This has been done repeatedly and frankly beat over viewers heads when mixed with the typical cop, CSI drama. However, the mixture of Villa and Rosie's characters are nice and their acting both together and individually is growing on me with every episode.I love the positive family atmosphere and feel that all the supporting actors do well with each other and at holding their own. I feel the show is a refreshing break from the dark, high-paced, slapstick comedy, reality hungry barrage of television we've been reduced to. It's clean, it's funny, it's cultural and it's light. That deserves a well done in my book! Personal hopes for the show: they keep Villa's and Rosie's relationship friendly. They bring back Nicole Ari Parker as his love interest (that was a lame excuse for a break up!), they continue to advance the cases they work on to be more interesting.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7389,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2015-09-23","keywords":"laboratory,pathologist,deduction,heart condition,miami florida","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004820/","name":"Morris Chestnut"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1632786/","name":"Jaina Lee Ortiz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827488/","name":"Gabrielle Dennis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069651/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0555624/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1029960/","name":"Todd Harthan"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3235099417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2MDc5ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1NzQ1NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2MDc5ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1NzQ1NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official trailer for Rosewood on Fox."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That deserves a well done in my book! Personal hopes for the show: they keep Villa's and Rosie's relationship friendly.

I loved seeing Morris Chesnut in a role where he really shines. The fact that he's gorgeous is not relative to his character, an overly optimistic, happy-go-lucky pain in Villa's butt.I didn't feel like that was overly played, some viewers Posed his character as cocky because he mentions himself in quirky ways, but it's actually a play on his sarcastic comedy. The show in and of itself is nothing to write home about, a basic pairing of mixed gender characters with a love/hate relationship (that will more than likely veer into a romantic direction- let us all pray not) who want to avoid admitting the obvious fact that they work well together and are made for each other. This has been done repeatedly and frankly beat over viewers heads when mixed with the typical cop, CSI drama. However, the mixture of Villa and Rosie's characters are nice and their acting both together and individually is growing on me with every episode.I love the positive family atmosphere and feel that all the supporting actors do well with each other and at holding their own.

This show is ABOUT Brenda Johnson.\n\nSo, in conclusion, this is an excellent, intelligent, amusing show, and I am sad to see the season end.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24162,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

And I wasn't disappointed. There are so many things I love about this show, but most of all it is hilarious to watch the characters interact with each other. Kyra Sedgwick excellently portrays a tough woman who won't let people walk all over her. People complain that Brenda is a b****, but maybe that's the point. What fun would it be to watch a show with nothing but sweetness and joy between the main characters, no conflict whatsoever? The tension she endures and often causes just makes the show all the more entertaining.\n\nWhat is most irritating, however, is to hear people complain about how the perpetrators in each show is obvious. Anybody who had listened what TNT had been saying about the show before it premiered would know that they said from the beginning that this show would be unlike other crime dramas in that the crime would not be the main focus.

And I wasn't disappointed. There are so many things I love about this show, but most of all it is hilarious to watch the characters interact with each other. Kyra Sedgwick excellently portrays a tough woman who won't let people walk all over her. People complain that Brenda is a b****, but maybe that's the point. What fun would it be to watch a show with nothing but sweetness and joy between the main characters, no conflict whatsoever? The tension she endures and often causes just makes the show all the more entertaining.\n\nWhat is most irritating, however, is to hear people complain about how the perpetrators in each show is obvious. Anybody who had listened what TNT had been saying about the show before it premiered would know that they said from the beginning that this show would be unlike other crime dramas in that the crime would not be the main focus. This show is ABOUT Brenda Johnson.\n\nSo, in conclusion, this is an excellent, intelligent, amusing show, and I am sad to see the season end.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24162,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

Arrested and extradited to Italy by the Brazilian police, Buscetta makes a decision that will change everything for the Mafia: he decides to meet with Judge Giovanni Falcone and betray the eternal vow he made to the Casa Nostra.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0269419/","name":"Pierfrancesco Favino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0194655/","name":"Maria Fernanda Cândido","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0273827/","name":"Fabrizio Ferracane"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069166/","name":"Marco Bellocchio"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0324308/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0293017/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066197/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069166/","name":"Marco Bellocchio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0763460/","name":"Valia Santella","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2002638/","name":"Ludovica Rampoldi"],"duration":"PT2H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Over the past few years we've had a plethora of books made into movies like The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, Divergent and Twilight along with their sequels. As long as they make money at the box office, Hollywood shall continue to make them. Another adaptation in the long line of young adult fiction is The 5th Wave which starts off promisingly but then becomes another generic teenage film with a romance subplot and unconvincing action scenes.\n\nCassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz) is just a normal teenage girl living happily in Ohio with her father (Ron Livingston), mother (Maggie Siff) and brother, Sam (Zackary Arthur). Their lives change when aliens invade Earth. The aliens inflict wave after wave of attack: the 1st wave refers to electromagnetic pulses being disabled resulting in a loss of communication and transportation; the 2nd wave is a flurry of natural disasters; the 3rd wave is an airborne deadly virus transmitted by birds; the 4th wave is the alien species inhabiting humans like parasites; the 5th wave is alien domination. The adults are separated from the children and the US army led by Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber) is taking control of the situation, placing children in quarantine so they can assist in fighting the alien species. Cassie finds herself isolated from her peers and must fight her own battles.\n\nThe plot is tense and exciting but that's just for the first half an hour. Once the children have been separated from the adults, things become a bit stale. It doesn't help when there's sizable plot holes throughout the movie. The story then drifts off into a romantic subplot which was just as boring as the Twilight series. When the children are trained to fight the aliens, there's a sense that all excitement has dissipated. If the focus was on Cassie fighting her own battles and trying to find her brother then it would have made for a more exciting movie.\n\nThe director is J Blakeson and this is his second directorial effort after The Disappearance of Alice Creed in 2009. It might be another seven years until he is employed again for he has some learning to do. Some of those close-up shots of the actors with their foreheads not in the frame were annoying and several of the fight scenes were difficult to see as they were filmed in natural lighting at night!\n\nChloe Grace Moretz is developing into a terrific actress if she hasn't reached that level already. She is convincing as the teenager who must make her own decisions when her family is no longer around to support her. The two actors who play her love interests, Nick Robinson and Alex Roe, are both devilishly handsome but their roles could be played by any young, unknown Hollywood heartthrob. Liev Schreiber adds integrity to the production and can always be relied upon to hold the fort in the acting stakes.\n\nThere are quite a few clever ideas in this film but the execution could have been much better. If you're a fan of young adult fiction, you won't be too disappointed but for people who have seen many movies, there's nothing new which will cause you to leap for joy.

Cassie is on the run, desperately trying to save her younger brother.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt2304933/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"mlaimlai2","dateCreated":"2016-01-15","inLanguage":"English","name":"Another wave of YA fiction!","reviewBody":"How many of these young adult fiction books are there? Over the past few years we've had a plethora of books made into movies like The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, Divergent and Twilight along with their sequels. As long as they make money at the box office, Hollywood shall continue to make them. Another adaptation in the long line of young adult fiction is The 5th Wave which starts off promisingly but then becomes another generic teenage film with a romance subplot and unconvincing action scenes.\n\nCassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz) is just a normal teenage girl living happily in Ohio with her father (Ron Livingston), mother (Maggie Siff) and brother, Sam (Zackary Arthur). Their lives change when aliens invade Earth. The aliens inflict wave after wave of attack: the 1st wave refers to electromagnetic pulses being disabled resulting in a loss of communication and transportation; the 2nd wave is a flurry of natural disasters; the 3rd wave is an airborne deadly virus transmitted by birds; the 4th wave is the alien species inhabiting humans like parasites; the 5th wave is alien domination. The adults are separated from the children and the US army led by Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber) is taking control of the situation, placing children in quarantine so they can assist in fighting the alien species. Cassie finds herself isolated from her peers and must fight her own battles.\n\nThe plot is tense and exciting but that's just for the first half an hour. Once the children have been separated from the adults, things become a bit stale. It doesn't help when there's sizable plot holes throughout the movie. The story then drifts off into a romantic subplot which was just as boring as the Twilight series. When the children are trained to fight the aliens, there's a sense that all excitement has dissipated. If the focus was on Cassie fighting her own battles and trying to find her brother then it would have made for a more exciting movie.\n\nThe director is J Blakeson and this is his second directorial effort after The Disappearance of Alice Creed in 2009. It might be another seven years until he is employed again for he has some learning to do. Some of those close-up shots of the actors with their foreheads not in the frame were annoying and several of the fight scenes were difficult to see as they were filmed in natural lighting at night!\n\nChloe Grace Moretz is developing into a terrific actress if she hasn't reached that level already. She is convincing as the teenager who must make her own decisions when her family is no longer around to support her. The two actors who play her love interests, Nick Robinson and Alex Roe, are both devilishly handsome but their roles could be played by any young, unknown Hollywood heartthrob. Liev Schreiber adds integrity to the production and can always be relied upon to hold the fort in the acting stakes.\n\nThere are quite a few clever ideas in this film but the execution could have been much better. If you're a fan of young adult fiction, you won't be too disappointed but for people who have seen many movies, there's nothing new which will cause you to leap for joy. The story sticks pretty much to the generic formula and doesn't reach any great heights. http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104505,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-01-22","keywords":"based on young adult novel,alien,male objectification,invasion,kiss","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3726226201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExOTczODM3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyOTA4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExOTczODM3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyOTA4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four waves of increasingly deadly attacks have left most of Earth decimated.

This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny.

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement.

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny.

Is the use of accurate information on medication always correct? I can't say as I am not a doctor. I watch it because I like the characters and the stories. I'm sure there could be improvements, as with most tv. But this is not a documentary, its meant for entertainment. At least the characters have back stories. Lives outside the hospital. Dick Wolf has smartly created a network of series that all intermingle and its interesting to see how the New York shows come into play with the Chicago shows. So, just try it.

My thought is, if you don't like it, don't watch it. I personally enjoy it, along with the Chicago franchise (Fire&amp;PD). The crossover events are especially fun to watch. Is the use of accurate information on medication always correct? I can't say as I am not a doctor. I watch it because I like the characters and the stories. I'm sure there could be improvements, as with most tv. But this is not a documentary, its meant for entertainment. At least the characters have back stories. Lives outside the hospital. Dick Wolf has smartly created a network of series that all intermingle and its interesting to see how the New York shows come into play with the Chicago shows. So, just try it.

I like watching a medically oriented programme that doesn't recycle those ER clichés that every such show from Third Watch to Grey's Anatomy has to hobble through for the plot. 'Get the paddles! clear!', 'he's gone into v-tach', tacky-cardia. I mean gimme a break. I'm sorry but the fake blood, fake body parts, fake killing and murdering all have their place but if a show wants a lighter take on living, outside of Vegas, Miami and LA with fewer guns, more food, flirting, and dating and then what's not to like? I wish them many happy returns. \n\nHart of Dixie definitely deserves a second and third season as far as I'm concerned. I think the show has plenty of material to explore with relationships, farce &amp; fancy and the fish out of water element. I really hope it gets renewed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49804,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-09-26","keywords":"fish out of water,doctor,female doctor,small town,female protagonist","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1377375/","name":"Rachel Bilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454809/","name":"Jaime King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0930317/","name":"Cress Williams"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0299663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1771570/","name":"Leila Gerstein"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hart Of Dixie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2390932761","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Hart Of Dixie"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

New Yorker and new doctor Zoe Hart accepts an offer from a stranger, Dr. Harley Wilkes, to work in his medical practice in Bluebell, Alabama. She arrives to find that he has died and left half the practice to her in his will." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt1832979/","name":"Hart of Dixie","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2NDU1MzQ3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk2NzQzNg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"New Yorker and new doctor Zoe Hart accepts an offer from a stranger, Dr. Harley Wilkes, to work in his medical practice in Bluebell, Alabama.

I like watching a medically oriented programme that doesn't recycle those ER clichés that every such show from Third Watch to Grey's Anatomy has to hobble through for the plot. 'Get the paddles! clear!', 'he's gone into v-tach', tacky-cardia. I mean gimme a break. I'm sorry but the fake blood, fake body parts, fake killing and murdering all have their place but if a show wants a lighter take on living, outside of Vegas, Miami and LA with fewer guns, more food, flirting, and dating and then what's not to like? I wish them many happy returns. \n\nHart of Dixie definitely deserves a second and third season as far as I'm concerned. I think the show has plenty of material to explore with relationships, farce &amp; fancy and the fish out of water element. I really hope it gets renewed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49804,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-09-26","keywords":"fish out of water,doctor,female doctor,small town,female protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1377375/","name":"Rachel Bilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0454809/","name":"Jaime King","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0930317/","name":"Cress Williams"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0299663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1771570/","name":"Leila Gerstein"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hart Of Dixie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2390932761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Hart Of Dixie"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's just good fun!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121447,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-10-03","keywords":"voice over narration,undercover,husband wife relationship,conflict of interest,female protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000159/","name":"Teri Hatcher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005031/","name":"Felicity Huffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0189220/","name":"Marcia Cross"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028589/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0156100/","name":"Marc Cherry"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1644955417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"TT #1"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The CG work may not be quite seamless, but this seems to be an intentional decision on the part of the directors, and it wasn't jarring in any way. The colour palette is well chosen, and the characters are well-drawn and stylised.\n\nSecond, the voice performances are great. Brad Pitt has always been an underrated actor in my opinion, so his performance here was, no surprise, excellent, as were those of Joseph Fiennes, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nThird, the pacing is great. This is a film that breezes by with plenty of action and a welcome lack of potty humour. There are scenes where vomit and bare bottoms are used, but not nearly to the same tasteless effect as most children's films these days.\n\nFinally, my kids loved it. They had a lot of fun, and so did my wife. This is not a crowd easily pleased by movies, so this is really saying something.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52008,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-17","keywords":"arabian,pirate,greek goddess,evil goddess,frame up","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3952981529","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA0OTkyMjU4MjdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDI2NjQ3MTAy._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA0OTkyMjU4MjdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDI2NjQ3MTAy._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Sinbad"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001876/","name":"Catherine Zeta-Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001212/","name":"Joseph Fiennes"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1369708/","name":"Patrick Gilmore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0426333/","name":"Tim Johnson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0517589/","name":"John Logan"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The CG work may not be quite seamless, but this seems to be an intentional decision on the part of the directors, and it wasn't jarring in any way. The colour palette is well chosen, and the characters are well-drawn and stylised.\n\nSecond, the voice performances are great. Brad Pitt has always been an underrated actor in my opinion, so his performance here was, no surprise, excellent, as were those of Joseph Fiennes, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nThird, the pacing is great. This is a film that breezes by with plenty of action and a welcome lack of potty humour. There are scenes where vomit and bare bottoms are used, but not nearly to the same tasteless effect as most children's films these days.\n\nFinally, my kids loved it. They had a lot of fun, and so did my wife. This is not a crowd easily pleased by movies, so this is really saying something.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52008,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-17","keywords":"arabian,pirate,greek goddess,evil goddess,frame up","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3952981529","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA0OTkyMjU4MjdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDI2NjQ3MTAy._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA0OTkyMjU4MjdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDI2NjQ3MTAy._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Sinbad","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001876/","name":"Catherine Zeta-Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001212/","name":"Joseph Fiennes"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1369708/","name":"Patrick Gilmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0426333/","name":"Tim Johnson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0517589/","name":"John Logan"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Men are still represented the same way -- to be blunt, idiots -- and it's still very targeted towards females.\n\nHowever what I found is that "Desperate Housewives" contains a very funny satirical, dark edge to its humor that elevates it above "Sex and the City" and some other such shows that were previously on television... as a result it can be enjoyed by men and women -- if you like dark suburban comedies such as "The War of the Roses" and "The 'burbs" you'll probably love this.\n\nIt centers around a neighborhood of housewives who are trying to figure out who may or may not have killed one of their friends, a woman who supposedly committed suicide.\n\nMeanwhile the show focuses on their relationships, trials and tribulations, mainly the character of Teri Hatcher, who is the one we are meant to feel the most sympathy for.\n\nAlthough "Desperate Housewives" is rather silly at times and perhaps a bit too smug and clever for its own good, I find it very easy to watch and one of the better entertainments available on television at the time. I'd recommend it to anyone who can appreciate absurd dark humor set in a realistic environment. It's just good fun!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121447,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-10-03","keywords":"voice over narration,undercover,husband wife relationship,conflict of interest,female protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000159/","name":"Teri Hatcher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005031/","name":"Felicity Huffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0189220/","name":"Marcia Cross"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028589/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0156100/","name":"Marc Cherry"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1644955417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwMGUzMWUtZDRkNi00ZDVjLWE1MjMtMTZhYjUyMWFiNWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"TT #1"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Lazy, unprofessional filmmaking that is an insult to the audience.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":105015,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-11-25","keywords":"resort,bikini,scantily clad female,tantra yoga,divorce","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Couples Retreat -- Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2681274905","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ1MDU3NTUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUzNzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ1MDU3NTUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUzNzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A comedy centered around four couples who settle into a tropical-island resort for a vacation.

It has been called "plodding," "stale," and "uninspired," thus, dashing the hopes of many movie goers who were hoping to see one of their favorite novels brought to life by one of their favorite directors, and starring one of their favorite actors. Since I'm not a slave to snobby film reviewers, I went to go see it for myself despite the negative hype. And as the credits rolled at the end of the movie, I felt increasingly unsettled; not because of the quality of the movie, but because one question lingered in my head: What's not to like? Am I crazy for actually being entertained by what I just saw? How could the critics pan what I, and those around me, seemed to enjoy? Okay, so that's more than one question....\n\nFirst, I have to qualify myself. I read the book and I LOVED it; couldn't put it down. I loved the history, the speculation, the riddles and puzzles, and the masterful blend of fact and fiction. Additionally, I'm not religious, although I was definitely familiar with Christian historical icons such as Jesus, John the Baptist, and Mary Magdelene before I read the book. I also happen to be a big fan of Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Ian McKellan.\n\nHaving said that, I went in prepared to like this movie, even though I had somewhat lowered my expectations based on the barrage of bad reviews. All of this proved to be a winning formula for me, apparently.\n\nIf you're like me and you loved the book and you like the artistic team that pursued making it into a movie, then you'll most likely come out satisfied. You won't mind what many critics have called "overly-long exposition" and historical flashbacks, because that's pretty much what the book consisted of. And in the book, it was absolutely engrossing! So, I personally didn't mind all of the explanation of history, symbols, etc.\n\nCritics have also found fault with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou's portrayals of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu (respectively), saying that they delivered flat performances. But once again, whoever read the book will remember that both of these characters weren't that dynamic on the written page, either. Of course, Sir Ian McKellan, with the juiciest role of Holy Grail scholar Sir Leigh Teabing, chews up the scenery every time he's shown on screen. Sir Leigh Teabing was also one of the richest characters in the book.\n\nI think that the people who won't like this movie are people who didn't read the book, and are going into the theater expecting a regular movie, which it's not. It's an adaptation of a very wordy, detailed, twisting, speculative novel that blends fact and fiction in a devastatingly effective way, and it's easy to get lost while watching the movie if you don't already know where the story is going. Sure, Ron Howard uses digitized, grainy flashbacks of ancient pagan rituals and societies to move the narrative along and to keep the audience on point, but I can see how it could be overwhelming to those who only know the bare bones of the plot. However, those who found it fascinating in the book will find pleasure in seeing the visual accompaniment to what they've already read.\n\nIn short, you go see this movie (or read the book) for how it challenges popularly-held beliefs; not for its rich, engaging character development. It's a quest for the "truth", and in terms of the IDEAS expressed, they did a dag-blasted good job of translating those ideas onto the screen. Those who often complain that movies don't stay true to the books that they're based on will find comfort in the fact that Akiva Goldsman and Ron Howard have stayed incredibly close to the original text when translating it onto the screen. However, this will be to the dismay of those movie-goers who haven't read the book, and are therefore expecting a traditional action thriller with traditional action thriller dialogue.\n\nIf you go to RottenTomatoes.com, you'll see the huge disparity between what the critics have said, and what the users have said regarding this film. While the cumulative critics rating is a dismal 22%, the combined user rating is a 74%, which is way above average for the site. That should speak volumes to whoever is skeptical about seeing the movie because of the bad reviews.\n\nThe bottom line is that it's definitely a movie worth watching if only to see how the creative team behind it went about turning the best-selling novel into celluloid. It's also a treat to see something in popular culture challenge popular religious ideals so skillfully, even if only in the form of fiction.\n\nMy advice: go see for yourself.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":414398,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-17","keywords":"self flagellation,conspiracy,bare butt male,self punishment,bound and gagged","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Da Vinci Code","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2369847833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Blu-Ray trailer for this conspiracy thriller starring Tom Hanks"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000606/","name":"Jean Reno"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000165/","name":"Ron Howard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0124737/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326040/","name":"Akiva Goldsman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1467010/","name":"Dan Brown"}],"duration":"PT2H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It has been called "plodding," "stale," and "uninspired," thus, dashing the hopes of many movie goers who were hoping to see one of their favorite novels brought to life by one of their favorite directors, and starring one of their favorite actors. Since I'm not a slave to snobby film reviewers, I went to go see it for myself despite the negative hype. And as the credits rolled at the end of the movie, I felt increasingly unsettled; not because of the quality of the movie, but because one question lingered in my head: What's not to like? Am I crazy for actually being entertained by what I just saw? How could the critics pan what I, and those around me, seemed to enjoy? Okay, so that's more than one question....\n\nFirst, I have to qualify myself. I read the book and I LOVED it; couldn't put it down. I loved the history, the speculation, the riddles and puzzles, and the masterful blend of fact and fiction. Additionally, I'm not religious, although I was definitely familiar with Christian historical icons such as Jesus, John the Baptist, and Mary Magdelene before I read the book. I also happen to be a big fan of Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Ian McKellan.\n\nHaving said that, I went in prepared to like this movie, even though I had somewhat lowered my expectations based on the barrage of bad reviews. All of this proved to be a winning formula for me, apparently.\n\nIf you're like me and you loved the book and you like the artistic team that pursued making it into a movie, then you'll most likely come out satisfied. You won't mind what many critics have called "overly-long exposition" and historical flashbacks, because that's pretty much what the book consisted of. And in the book, it was absolutely engrossing!

It involves two newlyweds (Dillon and Hudson) and their oafish house guest Dupree (Wilson), who is turning their new world upside down.\n\nI can't tell you what makes 'Dupree' tick so well, but something does. As far as plotting nothing seemed to be "filler" to me. Everything seems to drive the plot forward.

The music and dance performances of the movie are par excellence. All the dances are so fun to watch but Obviously the End Dance wins it all, it was Super Fantastic. The only thing Step up 3D lacked big time is its acting department, obviously all them can dance exceptionally well but their acting was quite poor except for Adam G.Sevani Aka. Moss and Alyson Stoner Aka. Cam. Adam and Alyson has prior acting experience so they were great along with their dancing. Adam and Alyson's road dance was one of the sweetest dance performance I've ever seen. Stunning looking Sharni Vinson danced really well and in some scenes she acted quite well. Gorgeous Boy Rick Malambri was the weakest Actor and Dancer among them all. His dancing with Sharni Vinson was great but in whole group he was the weakest link. Sadly, he had no expressions on his face whether he is serious, sad, happy or funny, he had the same expressions except when he Smiles. I think he got this job because of his looks because he is a terrible actor. One thing besides his good looks saved him was his awesome chemistry with Sharni Vinson. All the other dancers were great in dancing and terrible in acting. Overall its highly enjoyable because of its Incredible dance routines so, if we forget the terrible acting by most of them, its pretty good.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":56991,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-08-06","keywords":"3d,3 dimensional,competition,bed,false identity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Step Up 3D: Promo Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2734556697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjMyNzIyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjMyNzIyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A tight-knit group of New York City street dancers, including Luke (Malambri) and Natalie (Vinson), team up with NYU freshman Moose (Sevani), and find themselves pitted against the world's best hip hop dancers in a high-stakes showdown that will change their lives forever.

The music and dance performances of the movie are par excellence. All the dances are so fun to watch but Obviously the End Dance wins it all, it was Super Fantastic. The only thing Step up 3D lacked big time is its acting department, obviously all them can dance exceptionally well but their acting was quite poor except for Adam G.Sevani Aka. Moss and Alyson Stoner Aka. Cam. Adam and Alyson has prior acting experience so they were great along with their dancing. Adam and Alyson's road dance was one of the sweetest dance performance I've ever seen. Stunning looking Sharni Vinson danced really well and in some scenes she acted quite well. Gorgeous Boy Rick Malambri was the weakest Actor and Dancer among them all. His dancing with Sharni Vinson was great but in whole group he was the weakest link. Sadly, he had no expressions on his face whether he is serious, sad, happy or funny, he had the same expressions except when he Smiles. I think he got this job because of his looks because he is a terrible actor. One thing besides his good looks saved him was his awesome chemistry with Sharni Vinson. All the other dancers were great in dancing and terrible in acting. Overall its highly enjoyable because of its Incredible dance routines so, if we forget the terrible acting by most of them, its pretty good.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":56991,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-08-06","keywords":"3d,3 dimensional,competition,bed,false identity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Step Up 3D: Promo Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2734556697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjMyNzIyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjMyNzIyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A tight-knit group of New York City street dancers, including Luke (Malambri) and Natalie (Vinson), team up with NYU freshman Moose (Sevani), and find themselves pitted against the world's best hip hop dancers in a high-stakes showdown that will change their lives forever.

I didn't like the whole concept of the movie, it was boring and with not any funny moments. The only thing that I liked it was the interpretations of Neil Patrick Harris who played as Patrick Winslow and Brendan Gleeson who played as Victor but in my opinion weren't enough to make this movie more interesting or watchable. Regarding the direction which was made once more by Raja Gosnell was average and worse than the first.\n\nTo sum up, "The Smurfs 2" is a poor movie with not many good or funny scenes, average direction and in comparison with the first movie I have to say that this was even worse.

Unfortunately for one more time, I was disappointed because believe it or not this movie is even worse than the first one. I didn't like the whole concept of the movie, it was boring and with not any funny moments. The only thing that I liked it was the interpretations of Neil Patrick Harris who played as Patrick Winslow and Brendan Gleeson who played as Victor but in my opinion weren't enough to make this movie more interesting or watchable. Regarding the direction which was made once more by Raja Gosnell was average and worse than the first.\n\nTo sum up, "The Smurfs 2" is a poor movie with not many good or funny scenes, average direction and in comparison with the first movie I have to say that this was even worse. I don't recommend anyone to watch this movie because I believe that you are going to waste your time and I am sure that you won't like it at all.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-09-11","keywords":"based on cartoon,sequel,new york city,3 dimensional,live action cgi hybrid","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2897651993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQxNjNiZGUtM2RlMC00YWE4LWE2ODItMDZlODAzNzc0MGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQxNjNiZGUtM2RlMC00YWE4LWE2ODItMDZlODAzNzc0MGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Smurfs team up with their human friends to rescue Smurfette, who has been kidnapped by Gargamel since she knows a secret spell that can turn the evil sorcerer's newest creation - creatures called the Naughties - into real Smurfs.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000439/","name":"Neil Patrick Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1724323/","name":"Jayma Mays","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2953537/","name":"Katy Perry"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0331532/","name":"Raja Gosnell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0121181/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0316575/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826425/","name":"J.

A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things.

A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn't accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something. Kubrick used Keir Dullea in "2001: A Space Odyssey", yes, Keir Dullea, or as Noel Coward put it, Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow. We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she, one way or another, will land safely. She's terrific, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't as worried about her as I should have been. The last problem was the score. Why? A standard horror/action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there. I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department. Now, putting all that aside, director Alfonso Cuaron must be applauded and I strongly recommend you to run and see it in the biggest screen you can find and in 3D.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":790644,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,long take","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn't accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something. Kubrick used Keir Dullea in "2001: A Space Odyssey", yes, Keir Dullea, or as Noel Coward put it, Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow. We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she, one way or another, will land safely. She's terrific, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't as worried about her as I should have been. The last problem was the score. Why? A standard horror/action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there. I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department. Now, putting all that aside, director Alfonso Cuaron must be applauded and I strongly recommend you to run and see it in the biggest screen you can find and in 3D.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":790644,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,long take","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The soundtrack is great and the music by Christophe Beck is good.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":477897,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-05-26","keywords":"wedding,strip club,pubic hair,hangover,bachelor party","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Hangover: Part II - Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2196348185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTE0Njc0MDFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDUzNjU0MjMx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTE0Njc0MDFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDUzNjU0MjMx._V1_.jpg","description":"Phil, Stu, Alan and Doug travel to Bangkok for Stu's wedding.

It was hilarious the first time you told it. So you kept telling it over and over again. You told your mom, your friends, your wacky uncle and heck you even told it to your baby sister. Each time you tell that joke it lost some of its charm and you know this in your heart, but you keep telling it because it made you someone who was at least bearable at the office party. The Hangover Part III is THAT dreaded, self-destructive joke. \n\nThe first The Hangover was a surprise to everyone. It was a smart, engaging and an all-around funny move. It made the three protagonists into overnight stars, along with Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). Since The Hangover these four guys have experienced great success; Bradley Cooper has been nominated for an Oscar, Ed Helms became a little more then Andy from The Office, and Zach Galifianakis (the funniest of the bunch) starred on HBO's Bored to Death and Ken Jeong is a recurring character on Community. It's no surprise then that The Hangover made these guys in demand, and had the audience craving for more. So what better way to give the masses what they want than bringing the Wolf Pack back together for two more subpar movies. The Hangover Part III brings the crew back together for yet another wacky adventure, this time getting them to go to Tijuana and back to Vegas. There isn't really much to tell you about the plot that you can't figure out yourself. So it makes very little sense to go in any further detail about it, and I can move on to things that worked.\n\nBy far the funniest moment during the movie for my money's worth was when some girl in the theater screamed out loud after seeing one of the main character dangle for his life. The whole theater roared, and it was a genuinely hilarious moment. Too bad the same can't be said about the rest of the movie. No doubt there were some funny moments and personally the best bits of the movie were when Melissa Mccarthy was on the screen. Some of the other funniest moments were throwbacks to the original. I found myself doing a lot of "ooh I remember that from the first movie. Ha ha that reference is funny." Unfortunately that is all this movie is, it's a reminder of how great The Hangover was and we should nostalgia- laugh (is something I just made up) because we once thought there was no one funnier than Zack Galifianakis. Other than that any original content was drab at best. \n\nThe best laughs came from all the supporting characters, and the 'Big 3' it felt like were just there to collect the pay check. Bradly Cooper was by far the worst of the bunch. It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who was nominated for an Oscar not very long ago. Ed Helms and Zack Galifianakis were at least trying.\n\nIt was the overall chemistry of the three characters that made the original so great. The Hangover was a perfect recipe of Mac and Cheese where you threw in random ingredients and IT WAS THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE YOU EVER MADE! You tried replicating the original time after time, and tasted nothing but cheese and disappointment. It was just another Mac and Cheese. Sure it was served its purpose of feeding your broke student ass, but you yearned for that perfect gourmet Mac and Cheese fit to serve Gordon Ramsay himself. \n\nThe Hangover Part III is not a movie for people who are looking for genuine comedy. There are some very funny moments but the cheap laughs far outnumber the good ones. If you're going in expecting a repeat of The Hangover then don't waste your time and money. If you were disappointed by The Hangover Part II this movie will only throw salt on your wounds. It's sad to see such an initially brilliant trilogy end like this. Hangover 3 was nothing but one last attempt at squeezing every last dollar from the franchise.

Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch.

I'm sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can't do that, since that isn't my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of J.K. Rowling's magical world. \n\nFor starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure. \n\nThe creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it's more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they're all filled with personality. The sequences when they're catching these creatures are all really fun to watch. \n\nHowever there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There's also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn't that engaged in that part of the story to be honest. \n\nStill these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It's filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again.

Vjerojatno omiljena filmska franšiza jedne generacije, Rocky je svačiji omiljeni austajder. Ono što se događalo iza kamere jednako je fascinantno; Sylvester Stallone bio je gotovo nepoznati glumac sa snom. Poput svog lika u filmu, Sylvester je izašao na kraj s izazovom svog života i svijetu podario ovaj legendarni serijal. Pogledajte kako nas sam Sylvester Stallone vodi kroz kućne filmove i snimke iza kulisa kao da smo u njegovoj dnevnoj sobi i gledamo to zajedno s njim. Ovaj intimni dokumentarac potpisuje nevjerojatno nadareni, nagrađivani redatelj Derek Wayne Johnson.</desc>

Hopefully we haven't seen the last of Rocky Balboa, cause he still knows how to bring magic to the big screen.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114040,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2018-11-21","keywords":"baby,training montage,sequel,boxing match,boxer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi65124889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY0ZjVlMzEtYmI5MC00ZDAyLTgxZTctOWRjODczZTBiMjliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY0ZjVlMzEtYmI5MC00ZDAyLTgxZTctOWRjODczZTBiMjliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0430107/","name":"Michael B.

There was also the interest to see how Lady Gaga would fare in her acting debut and how Bradley Cooper would fare as first-time director. Decided to see it when taking a break from practise with nothing else better to do, going in with very high expectations, as part of my "seeing as many 2018 films as possible" quest.\n\nThis is not the only, or first, 'A Star is Born' film. There is one from 1937 with Mitzi Gaynor and Fredric March, my personal favourite. There is one from 1954, the most famous, which is overlong but does contain Judy Garland's best ever performance and terrific songs (especially the heart-wrenching "The Man That Got Away"), love James Mason in it too. There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and "Evergreen" is to die for.\n\nAs far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.\n\nIt's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.\n\nThe final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.\n\nWhat 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.\n\nVisually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as "The Man That Got Away" and "Evergreen" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. "I'll Never Love Again" and "Shallow" stand out.\n\nDialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.\n\nAltogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":355027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-05","keywords":"alcoholism,tinnitus,rising star,singer songwriter,singer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi94288665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","description":"A movie star helps a young singer and actress find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605792/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744839/","name":"Eric Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3391497/","name":"Will Fetters"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and "Evergreen" is to die for.\n\nAs far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.\n\nIt's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.\n\nThe final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.\n\nWhat 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.\n\nVisually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as "The Man That Got Away" and "Evergreen" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. "I'll Never Love Again" and "Shallow" stand out.\n\nDialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.\n\nAltogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":355027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-05","keywords":"alcoholism,tinnitus,rising star,singer songwriter,singer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi94288665","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","description":"A movie star helps a young singer and actress find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605792/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744839/","name":"Eric Roth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3391497/","name":"Will Fetters"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Serija "Na tuđem kauču", koju je osmislio i u kojoj glumi komičar Pete Holmes, vraća se na HBO s trećom sezonom. Serija je nadahnuta Holmesovim osobnim iskustvima kao komičara te pruža suptilan i urnebesan pogled u današnje stanje komedije. U ovoj je sezoni Pete pun energije te više ne spava na tuđim kaučima i ponovno ulazi u svijet njujorške stand-up komedije. No iako se poboljšao, to ne znači da je glavna faca u gradu. Dok nastavlja kružiti oko komičarke i bivše cure Ali, povezuje se s Kat koja ima jedinstven pogled na svijet komedije i ne pokušava se proslaviti pričanjem viceva. Pete je svakim nastupom sve bliže uspjehu te nastavlja usklađivati vjeru i izlaske i navigirati kroz stalno mijenjajuću komičarsku scenu.</desc>

Beautiful. Human.","reviewBody":"Good god, what is wrong with producers when they think this movie isn't worth making? China needs to get over itself and the US needs to stop being so friggin' and closed-minded with what people want to see in their theaters.\n\nThis story is absolutely deserving of an audience, and combines together through a beautiful lens a clashing of Western &amp; Eastern philosophies of life that really should be examined.\n\nAmericans have an idea of preserving one's independence and pressing back against being a cog in a machine, while China embraces being a cog and working together to ensure each other's safety and well-being. Both are philosophies that deserve meditation, and this movie does just that, while centering it around the touching story in the center between a grandmother and her family.\n\nI cannot give this movie enough praise.

China needs to get over itself and the US needs to stop being so friggin' and closed-minded with what people want to see in their theaters.\n\nThis story is absolutely deserving of an audience, and combines together through a beautiful lens a clashing of Western &amp; Eastern philosophies of life that really should be examined.\n\nAmericans have an idea of preserving one's independence and pressing back against being a cog in a machine, while China embraces being a cog and working together to ensure each other's safety and well-being. Both are philosophies that deserve meditation, and this movie does just that, while centering it around the touching story in the center between a grandmother and her family.\n\nI cannot give this movie enough praise. Each moment, each shot, each sound, each setting, each performance-- all orchestrated together seamlessly, giving the viewer an impartially guided experience full of subtle subtext and nuance that, if it doesn't get caught by the viewer, they at least get a gorgeous shot to enjoy.\n\nI was hesitant to give this movie ten stars, as I typically reserve that for movies that I would undoubtedly purchase and watch on repeat, but I could see myself watching this again and being in the mood for its ride.

Jason stars as Frank Martin. He's a hired gin who does driving jobs for a hefty fee. For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam.

The play between the characters, the more human version of Spock, the absolutely delightful "Scotty" (although his sidekick is one of those throwaway characters I dislike) as well as a much better crafted plot this time made for a completely enjoyable movie. The action is intense, the friendship deepened between the characters, the twists and turns are a bit predictable at times, but that is reminiscent of the franchise as a whole. I am already excited for the next movie. I tremendously respected and appreciated the ties in this movie to the elements that make Star Trek great - strong story line, deep connection to the characters and a philosophical element. In some of the older Star Trek episodes the moral/philosophical element can be oppressively heavy handed. No so in the new Trek movie. The ideas of friendship, family and humanity are woven through this movie with subtly and I will outright admit I more than teared up during the climactic scene in the engine room. EVEN though I had already figured out what was going to happen, I have already come to care about, respect and enjoy the new actors in their iconic roles.\n\nSo yes, ten out of ten. And let the haters, hate. Those who can not embrace change can go sit and watch old Star Trek reruns and bemoan the 'good old days' and spout off all the reasons why 'Star Trek ain't what it used to be'!!!! \n\nI, on the other hand, will boldly go and embrace the new with a continued reverence for the old.

The action is intense, the friendship deepened between the characters, the twists and turns are a bit predictable at times, but that is reminiscent of the franchise as a whole. I am already excited for the next movie. I tremendously respected and appreciated the ties in this movie to the elements that make Star Trek great - strong story line, deep connection to the characters and a philosophical element. In some of the older Star Trek episodes the moral/philosophical element can be oppressively heavy handed. No so in the new Trek movie. The ideas of friendship, family and humanity are woven through this movie with subtly and I will outright admit I more than teared up during the climactic scene in the engine room. EVEN though I had already figured out what was going to happen, I have already come to care about, respect and enjoy the new actors in their iconic roles.\n\nSo yes, ten out of ten. And let the haters, hate. Those who can not embrace change can go sit and watch old Star Trek reruns and bemoan the 'good old days' and spout off all the reasons why 'Star Trek ain't what it used to be'!!!! \n\nI, on the other hand, will boldly go and embrace the new with a continued reverence for the old. This movie makes it possible to love both.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":471745,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-05-15","keywords":"sequel to a reboot,star trek,human female,adult daughter,james t. kirk character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blu-ray Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi410167577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNDU4MjI0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY1NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNDU4MjI0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY1NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"New on Blu-ray: After the crew of the Enterprise find an unstoppable force of terror from within their own organization, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0704270/","name":"Zachary Quinto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757855/","name":"Zoe Saldana"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009190/","name":"J.J.

Right from the start, the film doesn't disappoint. It has a real depth that a lot of action/Sci Fi films don't have. A beautiful ambient soundtrack is matched perfectly to the pace of the film and in it's own right is a work of excellence that I now listen to on my iPod.\n\nThe characters are believable, and as expected, Tom Cruise plays his character really well. Morgan Freeman also plays an excellent role here, and I feel was perfectly cast for his role.\n\nThe special effects are very good. The creators went to great efforts with many of the sets and props, constructing full size ships, and massive screens to project backgrounds, rather than just use blue screen and CGI, which I feel responsible for ruining many modern films. (The Star Wars prequels comes to mind!) Where CGI is used, it's not over the top, and blends well with the live action and real sets. The tower set is a work of pure beauty, and helps add to the bright and wide open feel of the film, if that makes sense.\n\nAs I said previously, the soundtrack is fantastic, and allows me to watch the film over and over without getting bored of it. The sound effects are excellent as well. Specifically the drones make excellent noises at various stages of the film.\n\nThe overall plot is very good. It has a good amount of twists, and real depth. It is all played out at a pace that seems to adapt perfectly to the story. Action sequences are fast, and deeper, more emotional sequences get the slower pace they deserve.\n\nIt's funny, but it's one of those films that maybe didn't win any awards and maybe didn't break box office records.. but I find myself watching it again and again as it's just so watchable and enjoyable. There very few films I own that I can watch, go back to the beginning, and watch again right away. Black Hawk Down is one of them, and now so is Oblivion. In fact I only watched it last week, but after writing this review, I'm tempted to watch it again tonight.\n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and continue to do so!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":502014,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"post apocalypse,drone,cabin in the woods,black and white scene,alien invasion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi498116121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzU4NDc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU1NzgxOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzU4NDc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU1NzgxOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A court martial sends a veteran soldier to a distant planet, where he has to destroy the remains of an alien race.

I feel this movie aces both.\n\nA secluded environment and very good original music set the mood for full focus on story and character development. The plot twists time and time again as an intelligence power-play is delivered with very good performances by this little known cast. Character development feels perfect as each one gains depth without loosing essence.\n\nFrom a sci-fi point of view, it's not you're typical FX based movie, nor is it an action film.

I feel this movie aces both.\n\nA secluded environment and very good original music set the mood for full focus on story and character development. The plot twists time and time again as an intelligence power-play is delivered with very good performances by this little known cast. Character development feels perfect as each one gains depth without loosing essence.\n\nFrom a sci-fi point of view, it's not you're typical FX based movie, nor is it an action film. Nevertheless some very good effects and acting make for an excellent merge between fact and fiction that lets you concentrate on the philosophical questions the movie asks about the nature of AI. \n\nConclusion: I'd recommend this film to anyone.

If you want mindless techno-babble, then this show isn't for you. 2. If you don't manage to appreciate what good... no, let me rephrase that for you: exquisite acting is, then you definitely shouldn't watch it. 3. If you expect to have a crew of four, including a science doctor, an alien, a military and some random Indiana Jones guy, all of them solving new let's-save-the-Earth-before-lunch problems, then skip BSG, is not for you. 4. If you're afraid of seeing real human stories put into a SF shell, perhaps you should go back to Star Trek (and I'm a trekkie too, but...) 5. If you crave to hear 'shields up' or 'engage' or other classic one- liners, then you should rather settle for "frak". Or is it "frakk"? 6. If you're unable to follow a 4 season-long story arc with every episode adding something precious to it without having withdrawal symptoms, then you should really don't give it a try. 7. If all that you want is see people in tight suits flashing laser pistols and teleporting from harms' way, then change the channel. 8. If your interest for spiritual quests, tough sexy girls and people really dying and not returning is something like zero. Oh well, you might skip that 'dying and not returning part' :P 9. If you don't like space battles rendered so real (and with as most care for real physics as a TV SF show can take) that you feel you ARE there. 10. Finally, if you have a mind so closed that you cannot appreciate what the best SF show ever made is all about. \n\nIn my opinion, any problem that somebody would have with this show would be his/her problem, not the shows. For the rest of us, BSG raised the bar so high, we almost cannot enjoy other SF shows anymore.\n\nBut then... we can always re-watch it, and hope others will learn from it, too.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158119,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-01-14","keywords":"human in outer space,nuclear weapon,totalitarianism,prophecy,space opera","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001579/","name":"Edward James Olmos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001521/","name":"Mary McDonnell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0051397/","name":"Jamie Bamber"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103727/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176813/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129175/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488991/","name":"Glen A.

Right from the start, the film doesn't disappoint. It has a real depth that a lot of action/Sci Fi films don't have. A beautiful ambient soundtrack is matched perfectly to the pace of the film and in it's own right is a work of excellence that I now listen to on my iPod.\n\nThe characters are believable, and as expected, Tom Cruise plays his character really well. Morgan Freeman also plays an excellent role here, and I feel was perfectly cast for his role.\n\nThe special effects are very good. The creators went to great efforts with many of the sets and props, constructing full size ships, and massive screens to project backgrounds, rather than just use blue screen and CGI, which I feel responsible for ruining many modern films. (The Star Wars prequels comes to mind!) Where CGI is used, it's not over the top, and blends well with the live action and real sets. The tower set is a work of pure beauty, and helps add to the bright and wide open feel of the film, if that makes sense.\n\nAs I said previously, the soundtrack is fantastic, and allows me to watch the film over and over without getting bored of it. The sound effects are excellent as well. Specifically the drones make excellent noises at various stages of the film.\n\nThe overall plot is very good. It has a good amount of twists, and real depth. It is all played out at a pace that seems to adapt perfectly to the story. Action sequences are fast, and deeper, more emotional sequences get the slower pace they deserve.\n\nIt's funny, but it's one of those films that maybe didn't win any awards and maybe didn't break box office records.. but I find myself watching it again and again as it's just so watchable and enjoyable. There very few films I own that I can watch, go back to the beginning, and watch again right away. Black Hawk Down is one of them, and now so is Oblivion. In fact I only watched it last week, but after writing this review, I'm tempted to watch it again tonight.\n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and continue to do so!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":502014,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"post apocalypse,drone,cabin in the woods,black and white scene,alien invasion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi498116121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzU4NDc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU1NzgxOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzU4NDc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU1NzgxOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A court martial sends a veteran soldier to a distant planet, where he has to destroy the remains of an alien race.

Right from the start, the film doesn't disappoint. It has a real depth that a lot of action/Sci Fi films don't have. A beautiful ambient soundtrack is matched perfectly to the pace of the film and in it's own right is a work of excellence that I now listen to on my iPod.\n\nThe characters are believable, and as expected, Tom Cruise plays his character really well. Morgan Freeman also plays an excellent role here, and I feel was perfectly cast for his role.\n\nThe special effects are very good. The creators went to great efforts with many of the sets and props, constructing full size ships, and massive screens to project backgrounds, rather than just use blue screen and CGI, which I feel responsible for ruining many modern films. (The Star Wars prequels comes to mind!) Where CGI is used, it's not over the top, and blends well with the live action and real sets. The tower set is a work of pure beauty, and helps add to the bright and wide open feel of the film, if that makes sense.\n\nAs I said previously, the soundtrack is fantastic, and allows me to watch the film over and over without getting bored of it. The sound effects are excellent as well. Specifically the drones make excellent noises at various stages of the film.\n\nThe overall plot is very good. It has a good amount of twists, and real depth. It is all played out at a pace that seems to adapt perfectly to the story. Action sequences are fast, and deeper, more emotional sequences get the slower pace they deserve.\n\nIt's funny, but it's one of those films that maybe didn't win any awards and maybe didn't break box office records.. but I find myself watching it again and again as it's just so watchable and enjoyable. There very few films I own that I can watch, go back to the beginning, and watch again right away. Black Hawk Down is one of them, and now so is Oblivion. In fact I only watched it last week, but after writing this review, I'm tempted to watch it again tonight.\n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and continue to do so!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":502014,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"post apocalypse,drone,cabin in the woods,black and white scene,alien invasion","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi498116121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzU4NDc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU1NzgxOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzU4NDc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU1NzgxOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A court martial sends a veteran soldier to a distant planet, where he has to destroy the remains of an alien race.
