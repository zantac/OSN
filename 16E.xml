I thought it was pretty cool that there are these two kids Carmen and Juni Cortez who have to save their parents from danger. But I think it could have been better. I didn't really like how they showed how Carmen and Juni's parents got married because seriously, lets get on with the movie!!! But I LOVED the cast.

But their shared appearance is one best left open. ("I get a good vibe from these guys," the younger Hutch exclaims in one of the film's most savory self-referential moments.)\n\nThe film takes place in Bay City, "sometime during the '70s," when David Starsky (Stiller) -- a by-the-numbers police officer who spends his entire day chasing small-time crooks -- is paired up with a new partner, the reckless Ken "Hutch" Hutchinson (Wilson). Starsky and Hutch don't get along at first -- their mixed personalities collide, resulting in uncomfortable tension. Placed on an assignment involving an alleged drug lord (Vaughn), who has managed to create undetectable cocaine, Starsky and Hutch find themselves in a number of awkward situations: getting a statement by Big Earl (Ferrell), a dragon-obsessed inmate with some major issues; the usual tidbits of information from Huggy Bear (Dogg), a friend and informant of Hutch's; and of course the mandatory romantic subplot involving a pair of sexy cheerleaders.\n\nThe contrast of Starsky and Hutch is handled deliberately blunt: this comedy isn't as much a victim of the cop-buddy genre as it is a dead-on spoof. Hutch is a self-described "realist" -- during his introductory sequence he is shown fleeing the scene of a robbery with a stash of money. We assume he is undercover, and that's what he tells the cops when they try to arrest him. However, he's just using his badge as an excuse to commit crimes -- and get away with them.\n\nI asked myself if it was as possible as the film implies, but then the Constantly Yelling and/or Upset Police Captain (another clichéd role that happens to show up in all these movies) tells Hutch that it's the seventh time he's been arrested for robbery, and Hutch tells him that he's undercover -- trying to work his way in through the criminal underground. The joke, of course, is that we find out the robberies are all totally unrelated and bear no significant to a criminal underground of any kind.\n\nThere are a few sequences in the movie that deserve a description of their own, such as when Starsky accidentally consumes a large amount of cocaine and works himself into an ultimate-high-frenzy, battling on the disco floor of a nightclub for short-lived glory. After his opponent is unjustly awarded the gold medal, Starsky pulls out his gun and from there on the entire situation escalates into one of those scenes that -- like parts of Stiller's "There's Something About Mary" -- last on in viewers' minds even after the film itself fades away. The sort of sequence you might chuckle about to yourself as you drive home and recall certain moments from the film.\n\nStiller and Wilson -- presently two of Hollywood's most famous odd couples who have united together for a number of projects over the years -- are always likable in their films and nothing changes here. Wilson uses his sarcastic quips to an advantage, coming across as the smoother of the two, whereas Starsky is the bumbling and self-conscious idiot who is both over-protective and over-zealous.\n\nThe movie is at its best when it is cleverly satirizing the genre. Most of these films always include a sequence where the police captain will suspend the movie's protagonist and frown on him, saying something cheesy like, "Your father, who spent years on the force and was one of the highest-decorated officers, would be ashamed of you!" Instead, the police captain tells Starsky that his mother would be ashamed of him. And then after being suspended, Starsky takes a visit to his mother's grave and places a glazed donut on the headstone (she was the highly decorated cop in the family, apparently).\n\nThe film was directed by Todd Phillips, whose resume includes such raunchy efforts at comedy as the crude-but-enjoyable "Road Trip" and surprising "Old School." The latter film starred Ferrell and Vaughn and contained a cameo appearance by Snoop Dogg (as himself), so obviously these guys enjoyed working with Phillips and, I'm sure, agreed to contribute to this movie just for the heck of it.\n\nThe result is a very goofy, entertaining summer flick that never tries too hard and invariably never falls too hard, either. It does fall sometimes, but even then it usually takes its screw-ups with a pinch of salt. This is the sort of movie worth the price of admission -- just to sit back, forget your worries, and watch a couple of clowns bumble their way through an enjoyable farce of the '70s. It's not the kind of movie you'll be talking about after you see it -- just a simple popcorn flick. If you're out and about and you happen to stumble into a theater showing this film, you'll find your money well spent. I won't praise "Starsky and Hutch" for being a brilliant tongue-in-cheek spoof of the cop-buddy films -- I'll merely say that, for what it is, "Starsky and Hutch" is well-made and funny -- a surprisingly simple movie that is everything it pretends to be. The majority of films that use this approach suffer because they fall victim to their targets, especially most released this year, but where the others have failed "Starsky and Hutch" succeeds.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":143120,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2005-04-06","keywords":"character names as title,buddy movie,night club,1970s,russian roulette","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Starsky &amp; Hutch","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi25887001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q2NjI1OTYtMDJiNy00MDY2LWE0Y2EtY2E5ZDI2NTZjODU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q2NjI1OTYtMDJiNy00MDY2LWE0Y2EtY2E5ZDI2NTZjODU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Miramax"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004879/","name":"Snoop Dogg"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680846/","name":"Todd Phillips"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175068/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0088479/","name":"William Blinn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1192866/","name":"Stevie Long"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016088/","name":"John O'Brien"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Sure it might not have the ultimate originality of the 1st (of course), but it is still entertaining, one of the best of 1989.

I watch this regularly, especially at times when the reality of life is overwhelming, just to refocus and regain some sense of perspective.\n\nEverything in this film works toward one end: to transform the adult sense of fear back into the childlike sense of wonder at the world. From the very opening moments of the film, designed to create confusion and startlement, this movie creates a sensation of dread and foreboding. The dissonance of the soundtrack, the juxtaposition of images, they all are working to build into the viewer a feeling that something just isn't right, that something out of the ordinary is taking place, and underscoring this all with a sense that this is something to resist, to pull away from, to not allow it to affect one's "ordinary life." \n\nBut as the movie progresses, the tone begins to shift, and the true intent of the film begins to peek through. This isn't about being afraid of the unknown, but rather embracing it. Paying attention to the "subliminal images" in life, allowing them to lead you into something unknown and perhaps dangerous, only then can one be open to wonder and experience the world through the magical eyes of a child.\n\nDreyfuss' character takes us on this journey, met with resistance all along the way. His wife, his neighbors, his job, his community, all are working against him, and it's only when he's reached his craziest that he truly gives in and begins to stop trying to understand and instead embraces the experiences in store for him. The scientific community is seeking to understand, but without having any personal calling to be involved. Only Barry is truly able to throw himself into the strangeness that is taking place, and his enthusiasm is greeted by both the characters and the audience as somehow alien and threatening.\n\nThe ending of this film, when all the fear is finally stripped away and the sense of amazed wonder overtakes everyone on the screen and in the audience, brings about an amazing catharsis. Discarding all the "adult" sensibilities and being able to approach life once again with a sense of innocent amazement for the Strange hidden amongst the Ordinary, one can begin again to approach life from a fresh vantage point. \n\nPowerful, mystifying, and rejuvenating.

When you're having a bad day and want to watch a brainless, popcorn flick that will most likely have you cracking up virtually the entire movie, then I suggest you see this movie as soon as possible.\n\nThis is another reason why I love Sandler so much. He's not afraid to push the envelope to garner a laugh. He knows he's capable of doing a more serious role and have success. I know how good he was in Punch-Drunk Love and Reign Over Me, but he's very versatile and I can't complain about an actor with that quality.\n\nI gave this a 7 out of 10, I'm not afraid to admit that I liked the Zohan.., and I certainly wouldn't mess with him!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":196202,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-06-06","keywords":"hair stylist,palestinian,funny arab,arab israeli conflict,super strength","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"You Don't Mess with the Zohan","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1625489689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNjA5NjEwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEwODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNjA5NjEwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEwODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"You Don't Mess with the Zohan - 30 second spot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001806/","name":"John Turturro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004825/","name":"Emmanuelle Chriqui"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0806912/","name":"Robert Smigel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As long as the action sequences are well made that is. "xXx: State of the Union" is a fair try in the genre but ultimately falls short.\n\nThe plot is as ridiculous as in the first movie. The NSA-agent Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) is once again looking in weird places trying to find a new agent that can break the rules and succeed. This time he finds Darius Stone (Ice Cube) in a military prison. Stone is an ex Navy Seal who will help Gibbons fight off a rogue part of the US Military trying to dispose of the president.\n\nSeriously, no one watches these movies for the plot anyway. So that the plot is ridiculous and cheesy is beside the point. No one watches this for the acting either. So that Ice Cube is not as much an actor as a walking scowl is ALSO beside the point. He does about as good a job as Vin Diesel did anyway. What is NOT beside the point though is the fact that "xXx: State of the Union" employs the same method of action filming as many other Hollywood-movies of late. You know the method: "move the camera exceptionally close and shake it like if the camera-man was a spastic". I know that this is to hide the fact that Ice Cube doesn't know how to fight. Still it's incredibly irritating! Also the lack of logic is too evident at times. Like Ice Cube driving a sports car 360km/h on a train track with his tires torn off... Seriously.\n\nOtherwise this had some potential. The technical quality is great, the movie looks really expensive. It has a lot of fun gadgets and crappy one-liners. And the speed of this movie is absolutely insane. Right from the beginning Lee Tamahori steps on it without ever looking back. So even though i can't say i really enjoyed this movie it was never boring, there is always something happening on screen. But the flaws in mostly the action department as well as the complete lack of logic disturbs the experience. It's still a lot better than the first movie though. I found the first one to be complete garbage, while this is still at least somewhat entertaining at times.\n\nSo in the end i think this "James Bond on steroids" will probably attract a lot of 15-yearolds that like when things keep moving and lights keep flashing. People who like to see a plot and at least some traces of logic might want to stay away though. It could have been the brainless action movie of the year, but it desperately needs some better action-directing for that.

Local crime lords want him out, but Carter unrelentingly proceeds in finding the truth.\n\nStarting with a promising beginning (though it remains amusing that someone thought that Stallone can match Caine's acting) the film soon slumps into a bad case of mediocrity. It has the same idea as the original and tries to be as badass with its kinetic and almost experimental direction, but ends up being just poor. Stallone's Carter is given an almost soft side that goes complete against the character from the first film. On top of that there are some enjoyable car chases, but they serve as sensationalism that was critically lacking from the first film.\n\nThen there is the ending, which has some merit (since the film already establish Carter as softer then the original), but even so, it is still pretty stupid and leaves the film with little to say or resonate with. That ultimately makes this is second rate crime movie that you might enjoy, but don't count it. --- 5/10\n\nRated R for violence and profanity","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33778,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-04-11","keywords":"enforcer,movie flop,cigarette,body lands on a car,character repeats someone else's dialogue","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Get Carter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi550306585","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGFlZGQ2MTQtNDMwMS00YjFiLTk3OWItZWI1YzBhZjRmMzk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGFlZGQ2MTQtNDMwMS00YjFiLTk3OWItZWI1YzBhZjRmMzk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000337/","name":"Rachael Leigh Cook"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001669/","name":"Miranda Richardson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0443181/","name":"Stephen Kay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033472/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043393/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052111/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0507794/","name":"Ted Lewis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571346/","name":"David McKenna"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Local crime lords want him out, but Carter unrelentingly proceeds in finding the truth.\n\nStarting with a promising beginning (though it remains amusing that someone thought that Stallone can match Caine's acting) the film soon slumps into a bad case of mediocrity. It has the same idea as the original and tries to be as badass with its kinetic and almost experimental direction, but ends up being just poor. Stallone's Carter is given an almost soft side that goes complete against the character from the first film. On top of that there are some enjoyable car chases, but they serve as sensationalism that was critically lacking from the first film.\n\nThen there is the ending, which has some merit (since the film already establish Carter as softer then the original), but even so, it is still pretty stupid and leaves the film with little to say or resonate with. That ultimately makes this is second rate crime movie that you might enjoy, but don't count it. --- 5/10\n\nRated R for violence and profanity","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33778,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-04-11","keywords":"enforcer,movie flop,cigarette,body lands on a car,character repeats someone else's dialogue","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Get Carter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi550306585","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGFlZGQ2MTQtNDMwMS00YjFiLTk3OWItZWI1YzBhZjRmMzk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGFlZGQ2MTQtNDMwMS00YjFiLTk3OWItZWI1YzBhZjRmMzk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000337/","name":"Rachael Leigh Cook","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001669/","name":"Miranda Richardson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0443181/","name":"Stephen Kay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033472/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043393/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052111/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0507794/","name":"Ted Lewis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571346/","name":"David McKenna"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Others have eloquently talked about the wonderful music and score, the very real script, and excellent acting, so there is no need for me to elaborate. But another element of the movie that I found even more notable is its depiction of Native Americans as individuals with feelings, honorable if at the same time frequently peculiar customs, and as human beings with human urges and impulses. What a refreshing contrast to all of the pablum and nonsense that has been the staple of Hollywood and its treatment of "injuns" over the years.\n\nSo it comes as no surprise that some of the criticisms here come from people who believe the movie is anti-white or anti-army or glorifies Native Americans. But I believe these comments completely miss the mark. First off, Costner in the movie himself portrays an army figure--the movie is trying to show that not all people in the army are beasts. This is again brought out by the young leader of the troops attempting to arrest Costner and bring him back to trial; this soldier is depicted as a fair and honest young man put in a difficult spot.\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons for the shortsightedness of some of the movie critics is their lack of understanding of the terrible plight faced by native Americans and the awful, holocaust-like consequences of the policy that was known as "Indian Removal." And yes, I am a professor who knows something about the subject and who uses this film in class (and I am not afraid to admit it). Please have a look at "As Long as Grass Grows or Water Runs" a chapter in Howard Zinn's famous book, "A People's History of the United States." It uses many primary sources to describe exactly what happened; the phrase, by the way, was a promise made by Andrew Jackson (later President Jackson) to Cherokee Indians if they would relocate (a promise later broken, of course). Jackson, by the way, refused to enforce a court order from the Supreme Court in the case of Worcester v. Georgia involving an individual sentenced to prison for questioning the legitimacy of laws repressing the Cherokees. Jackson also fought the Creeks killing hundreds of them and later boasted, "the truth is, the (Creeks) did not respect the power of the United States...We bleed our enemies in such cases to give them their senses." From 1814 to 1824, Jackson was instrumental in fashioning a series of treaties that deprived Indians of over 3/4 of Alabama and Florida, one-third of Tennessee, one-fifth of Georgia and Mississippi, and parts of Kentucky and North Carolina. These treaties were little more than land grabs and Jackson is widely known to have practiced extensive bribery and other dirty tricks in securing them. At the same time, Jackson and his friends and relatives received many patronage appointments as land agents, traders etc (I guess he would have gotten along well with Dick Chenney and Bush) and of course, he and his friends bought up much of this land that became suddenly available.\n\nAnother good source for what happened to the Indians is the eyewitness account of a soldier who served in the mounted infantry. John G. Burnett in 1890 published his reminiscences, "The Cherokee Removal through the Eyes of a Private Soldier". "I was sent as interpreter into the Smoky Mountain Country in May, 1838, and witnessed the execution of the most brutal order in the History of American Warfare. I saw the helpless Cherokees arrested and dragged from their homes, and driven at the bayonet point into the stockades. And in the chill of a drizzling rain on an October morning, I saw them loaded like cattle or sheep into 645 wagons and started toward the West." This evokes images not unlike those showing S.S. officers putting Jews in railroad cars. "At this time, 1890," continues Burnett, "we are too near the removal of the Cherokees for our young people to fully understand the enormity of the crime that was committed against a helpless race. Truth is, the facts are being concealed from the young people of today." Burnett later describes the "streams of blood that flowed in the Indian country in the summer of 1838" and the "4000 silent graves that mark the trail of the Cherokees to their exile", again very much like a World War II death march. So what I find shocking about "Dances With Wolves" is that it shows, to a great extent, the brutality of the conflict between "settlers" from one civilization, and the people who already lived on the land. This stands as a testament to Costner and his willingness to take this brave position. It is precisely because this subject has become taboo and because most Americans haven't a clue as to their own history, because their image of America is similar to Pleasantville (before colorization), that many people find this movie revolting and unacceptable. Hence, they prefer to shoot the messenger of the "bad" news-- Costner.\n\nFinally, as others have pointed out, the movie does not glorify all Native Americans. It shows that there is a spectrum of behavior amongst them, and also shows that many of their customs (eating fresh meat from just-killed animals, for example) are shocking and barbaric to us today.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":251274,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"1990-11-21","keywords":"friendship,native american,19th century,wolf,famous score","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dances With Wolves: 20th Anniversary Edition","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2341967897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTMwNTZkOWUtN2VjNS00NzNiLTgzZTgtMWJmZmEwNTBhZmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTMwNTZkOWUtN2VjNS00NzNiLTgzZTgtMWJmZmEwNTBhZmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Dances With Wolves"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000126/","name":"Kevin Costner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001521/","name":"Mary McDonnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001295/","name":"Graham Greene"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000126/","name":"Kevin Costner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012524/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067785/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052092/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0086658/","name":"Michael Blake"}],"duration":"PT3H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Others have eloquently talked about the wonderful music and score, the very real script, and excellent acting, so there is no need for me to elaborate. But another element of the movie that I found even more notable is its depiction of Native Americans as individuals with feelings, honorable if at the same time frequently peculiar customs, and as human beings with human urges and impulses. What a refreshing contrast to all of the pablum and nonsense that has been the staple of Hollywood and its treatment of "injuns" over the years.\n\nSo it comes as no surprise that some of the criticisms here come from people who believe the movie is anti-white or anti-army or glorifies Native Americans. But I believe these comments completely miss the mark. First off, Costner in the movie himself portrays an army figure--the movie is trying to show that not all people in the army are beasts. This is again brought out by the young leader of the troops attempting to arrest Costner and bring him back to trial; this soldier is depicted as a fair and honest young man put in a difficult spot.\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons for the shortsightedness of some of the movie critics is their lack of understanding of the terrible plight faced by native Americans and the awful, holocaust-like consequences of the policy that was known as "Indian Removal." And yes, I am a professor who knows something about the subject and who uses this film in class (and I am not afraid to admit it). Please have a look at "As Long as Grass Grows or Water Runs" a chapter in Howard Zinn's famous book, "A People's History of the United States." It uses many primary sources to describe exactly what happened; the phrase, by the way, was a promise made by Andrew Jackson (later President Jackson) to Cherokee Indians if they would relocate (a promise later broken, of course). Jackson, by the way, refused to enforce a court order from the Supreme Court in the case of Worcester v. Georgia involving an individual sentenced to prison for questioning the legitimacy of laws repressing the Cherokees. Jackson also fought the Creeks killing hundreds of them and later boasted, "the truth is, the (Creeks) did not respect the power of the United States...We bleed our enemies in such cases to give them their senses." From 1814 to 1824, Jackson was instrumental in fashioning a series of treaties that deprived Indians of over 3/4 of Alabama and Florida, one-third of Tennessee, one-fifth of Georgia and Mississippi, and parts of Kentucky and North Carolina. These treaties were little more than land grabs and Jackson is widely known to have practiced extensive bribery and other dirty tricks in securing them. At the same time, Jackson and his friends and relatives received many patronage appointments as land agents, traders etc (I guess he would have gotten along well with Dick Chenney and Bush) and of course, he and his friends bought up much of this land that became suddenly available.\n\nAnother good source for what happened to the Indians is the eyewitness account of a soldier who served in the mounted infantry.

Like all of his other roles, Smith brings absolutely nothing to the part, and plays it just as stupidly as it is written and conceived.  Martin Lawrence, on the other hand, has never been good or funny in anything he's every been in, ever, so no surprises from him.\n\nNow they're making a Bad Boys II.

If you have seen any of the Lethal Weapon movies, you already know 90% of the jokes and dialogue from Bad Boys.  The twist is that Smith's character is some millionaire playboy who takes a job as a drug cop because of the excitement and the satisfaction of ridding the streets of scum.  Like all of his other roles, Smith brings absolutely nothing to the part, and plays it just as stupidly as it is written and conceived.  Martin Lawrence, on the other hand, has never been good or funny in anything he's every been in, ever, so no surprises from him.\n\nNow they're making a Bad Boys II.  Maybe I will take up doing crosswords or something, because movies just keep getting worse.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":251573,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1995-04-07","keywords":"miami florida,buddy movie,criminal investigation,murder investigation,usa","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bad Boys","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2344091929","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExNzlmNDgtYTI4NC00OTg3LTk3MTgtZTI4YzkxNjY1NDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExNzlmNDgtYTI4NC00OTg3LTk3MTgtZTI4YzkxNjY1NDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001454/","name":"Martin Lawrence","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102288/","name":"Lisa Boyle"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000881/","name":"Michael Bay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102770/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0303032/","name":"George Gallo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057398/","name":"Michael Barrie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0611848/","name":"Jim Mulholland"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When will companies realise that the "reality" shaky camera work just doesn't add anything, and, actually detracts from an audience viewing and taking in what's happening. It actually looks as though the camera operator is deliberately shaking it. The editing also consists single shots of the camera panning up and down individuals, at various points, along with extreme close-ups. Honestly if this had good editing/camerawork it would get me hooked. Now it's just like watching an extremely bad found footage series albeit with good actors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1758,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-03-08","keywords":"arrest","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477127/","name":"Ryan Kwanten"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0492345/","name":"Katrina Law"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0362484/","name":"Cory Hardrict"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0448478/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1546172/","name":"Joe Halpin"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Oath: Season 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3680550169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZiOWQ4N2UtY2M3MS00OTI0LWIxNzEtMDY4NDRiODllYzk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDZiOWQ4N2UtY2M3MS00OTI0LWIxNzEtMDY4NDRiODllYzk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Oath: Season 1"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66116,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-08-27","keywords":"stripper,premarital sex,sex standing up,sex scene,belgrade serbia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3721243673","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An ex-CIA operative is brought back in on a very personal mission and finds himself pitted against his former pupil in a deadly game involving high level CIA officials and the Russian president-elect.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3478396/","name":"Luke Bracey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1385871/","name":"Olga Kurylenko"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002044/","name":"Roger Donaldson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088199/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0500612/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3360218/","name":"Michael Finch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2244980/","name":"Karl Gajdusek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1952653/","name":"Bill Granger"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66116,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-08-27","keywords":"stripper,premarital sex,sex standing up,sex scene,belgrade serbia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3721243673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An ex-CIA operative is brought back in on a very personal mission and finds himself pitted against his former pupil in a deadly game involving high level CIA officials and the Russian president-elect.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3478396/","name":"Luke Bracey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1385871/","name":"Olga Kurylenko"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002044/","name":"Roger Donaldson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088199/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0500612/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3360218/","name":"Michael Finch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2244980/","name":"Karl Gajdusek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1952653/","name":"Bill Granger"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Adams and Waltz seem to endeavor to stretch beyond the Movie-Of-The-Week limitations in place but fail, kitsch ultimately winning out over sentimentality. It's a generic film, surprisingly so.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89735,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-12-25","keywords":"painting,habitual liar,abusive husband,1950s,secret","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2391846681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc2NTE3ODM5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg1ODQ3MjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc2NTE3ODM5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg1ODQ3MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A drama centered on the awakening of the painter Margaret Keane, her phenomenal success in the 1950s, and the subsequent legal difficulties she had with her husband, who claimed credit for her works in the 1960s.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0010736/","name":"Amy Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910607/","name":"Christoph Waltz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0396812/","name":"Danny Huston"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000318/","name":"Tim Burton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150452/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0156876/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0081851/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0018735/","name":"Scott Alexander","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0438989/","name":"Larry Karaszewski"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He is also one of the hardest working filmmakers today, taking on such roles as producer, writer, director, cinematographer and editor. As a director, he has been able to pump out two feature length films in a single year and he has done this more than just once. However, over the last decade his films have become weaker as it seems as though not enough time has been invested into exploring the emotional depths of the stories he is bringing to life. Therefore they lack the ability to conjure genuine emotion from their audience. It almost seems as if he does not care about whether or not audiences are moved or entertained, but rather is just doing his job, moving from one project to the next.\n\nAt the beginning of the year it was announced that Soderbergh was retiring as a director and that SIDE EFFECTS would be his last theatrical film release.

As Emily's symptoms worsen, her psychiatrist and her try to find an anti-depressant that works for her. After many failed attempts Dr. Banks takes the advice of Emily's previous doctor, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, and prescribes her a new experimental medication called Ablixa. The side effects attempt to destroy both of their lives.\n\nSide Effects is shot and paced like a serious, well-crafted art film studying the truth behind depression which slowly builds into one hell of a tense thriller. What hold the film back is the ending. By the end this serious, well-crafted art film has succumb to a Hollywood twist gimmick popcorn flick better suited for the late 90's. I couldn't help thinking that someone had farted in the kitchen. I do not know if Soderbergh was just following the screenplay or if he was told to give it a happy ending that over-explains everything, leaving no sense of mystery and easily spotted plot-holes.\n\nOf course, even with the out-of-place, poorly written surprise conclusion, Side Effects is still better than the majority of thrillers being produced today.

Russell's 'The Fighter' follow the formula of underdog surpassing all obstacles and winning in the end (as is the case with this genre)? The answer is yes but 'The Fighter' still manages to maintain a unique quality. First of all, the four principle characters: Micky, Dicky, Charlene and Alice are unlike anyone one has seen in this kind of film.\n\nThey are wonderfully defined and the actors who portray them are cast against type and turn in their finest performance. Both Melissa Leo and Amy Adams are like you've never seen them before and they appear very natural on screen. Mark Wahlberg is superly restrained and Christian Bale does one of his best works of his entire career. They are supported by a host of impressive actors.\n\nIn addition to the marvelous performances, the makeup department has done a remarkable job, especially by making Leo look old enough to play Bale and Wahlberg's mother. Bale actually does look years older than Wahlberg (when in reality he's a year younger) and that just adds more to the authenticity.\n\nFrom the opening sequence, I was under the impression that 'The Fighter' was going to be a documentary-type movie but O. Russell tricks and surprises the audience with that. His execution is subtle unlike the loud approach which other directors commonly follow.\n\nFor me 'The Fighter', is more about the human connection than the sports itself. Boxing is clearly a metaphor as is the title which has multiple meanings. Even though he's been constantly let down by his family, Micky chose to give them a second chance and have them by his side. Even though Charlene disapproves Alice and Dicky's involvement in Micky's career, Dicky attempts to persuade her because he knows that Micky won't stand a chance without her by his side. Even though Alice and Charlene don't see eye to eye, there's a silent acceptance between them as they know that Micky needs them both.\n\nI am really beginning to have more respect for Mark Wahlberg for producing gems like this (in addition to some amazing TV-series like 'In Treatment', 'Boardwalk Empire' and 'Entourage') and his growth as an actor is obviously apparent (he just needs to avoid tripe like 'The Happening' at all costs).\n\n'The Fighter' is a winner on various levels."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":352164,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2010-12-17","keywords":"boxing,boxer,scantily clad female,panties,nipples visible through clothing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Fighter: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2330986777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk5ODc4ODk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA2NDk4Mw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk5ODc4ODk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA2NDk4Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A look at the early years of boxer "Irish" Micky Ward and his brother who helped train him before going pro in the mid 1980s."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0010736/","name":"Amy Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751102/","name":"David O.

But in an unexpected and refreshing change, writer Chris Sparling made this story more about family dynamics and humanities quest for survival during an extinction-level disaster. This felt less Hollywood-ish, and more realistic than I expected, and that's a good thing. Director Ric Roman Waugh did a great job putting together Sparling's script. The 119 min runtime was just right, as was the pacing. The score was decent, but felt a little overbearing in some scenes.

But in an unexpected and refreshing change, writer Chris Sparling made this story more about family dynamics and humanities quest for survival during an extinction-level disaster. This felt less Hollywood-ish, and more realistic than I expected, and that's a good thing. Director Ric Roman Waugh did a great job putting together Sparling's script. The 119 min runtime was just right, as was the pacing. The score was decent, but felt a little overbearing in some scenes. The casting was good, with Butler delivering as usual, but Morena Baccarin seemed bland in most of the film, and her constant side view during the car ride highlighting her terrible nose job was annoying.

The Devil's Double is based on the true story of Latif Yahia, an Iraqi soldier chosen by the regime to be the body-double of the dictator's infamous son Uday, with both roles played by Dominic Cooper.\n\nThe perks of the job are acceptable: enough designer clothing and willing women to make the average Premiership footballer looking like a trappist monk. However, the downsides are considerable too: torture, being shot at – and the fact that the penalty for seeking alternative employment is the death of Latif's entire family.\n\nDominic Cooper stars in Devil's Double with Ludivine Sagnier.\n\nDominic Cooper stars in Devil's Double with Ludivine Sagnier.\n\nIt is easy to see why The Devil's Double has been compared to a gangster film. All the whirring, terrifying madness of Uday's world is depicted with the brutal verve one finds in Scarface and other films of its ilk. Instigating nightclub orgies while American bombs are exploding and shooting at loyal companions in psychotic rages are all part of Uday's regular routine.\n\nThe direction, intermingling footage of Operation Desert Storm with debauchery, captures the craziness of Uday and Latif's world with a lurid style.\n\nAgain, like a great underworld film, Cooper's performance as the central villain is masterful, capturing Uday's menacing madness and chewing the scenery in between sucking breasts or shovelling cocaine up his nose. His performance as Latif is equally striking, but in a more nuanced way. We are never in doubt which one Cooper is portraying; his sickened desperate body language showing through even when Latif is Uday.\n\nYet this film is not Scarface, and Uday is not Tony Montana. Tony Montana, like most anti-heroes found in films depicting criminals, had a form of morality. It may have been a twisted, cocaine-fuelled morality but it was one none the less. Uday has no morality; worse than that, he's evil even by the standards of his father, a man who thought nothing of gassing entire ethnic groups. This gives the film a heart of darkness. Uday is possibly one of the most horrifying characters ever to grace a cinema screen, proving it at regular harrowing intervals with crimes of a scarcely believable depravity.\n\nThis leads me to the film's central flaw. Despite Cooper's performance, Latif's story never quite feels as compelling as it should be. The script at times makes a good man's forced descent into hell on Earth seem more like a mob underling's troubled conscience upon witnessing his boss go too far. One scene, which directly juxtaposes his actions in saving others from Uday's horrors, doesn't have anywhere near the emotional resonance it should. One gets a sense that in trying to show us a world in which a moral compass is more likely to be thrust into the genitals of an innocent than providing any sort of guidance, the film has lost some of its humanity along with its protagonists.\n\nDespite these flaws, though, The Devil's Double is still an excellent film. It is a brave attempt to portray a difficult and scarcely believable story. Even its failure to completely emote is understandable given the skill with which it presents its harrowing world. Due to this, and possibly the performance of the year from Dominic Cooper, its flaws are eminently forgivable.\n\nVerdict: ●●●● A must-watch for Cooper's performance alone, but expect to be troubled as well as thrilled throughout.\n\nRead more reviews on www.theupcoming.co.uk"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":61403,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-09-08","keywords":"debauchery,rape,psychopath,nudity,stripping","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Devil's Double","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4213939481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMzk5MTcxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA5NjcwNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMzk5MTcxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA5NjcwNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Forced to become the body double of Uday Hussein, Latif Ahmed (Cooper) bears witness to daily life under Saddam Hussein's reign, from lavish extravagances to sadistic acts of brutality."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1002641/","name":"Dominic Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0756203/","name":"Ludivine Sagnier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712562/","name":"Raad Rawi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848414/","name":"Lee Tamahori"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106821/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027006/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0859241/","name":"Michael Thomas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2205151/","name":"Latif Yahia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714460/","name":"Emjay Rechsteiner"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Russell's 'The Fighter' follow the formula of underdog surpassing all obstacles and winning in the end (as is the case with this genre)? The answer is yes but 'The Fighter' still manages to maintain a unique quality. First of all, the four principle characters: Micky, Dicky, Charlene and Alice are unlike anyone one has seen in this kind of film.\n\nThey are wonderfully defined and the actors who portray them are cast against type and turn in their finest performance. Both Melissa Leo and Amy Adams are like you've never seen them before and they appear very natural on screen. Mark Wahlberg is superly restrained and Christian Bale does one of his best works of his entire career. They are supported by a host of impressive actors.\n\nIn addition to the marvelous performances, the makeup department has done a remarkable job, especially by making Leo look old enough to play Bale and Wahlberg's mother. Bale actually does look years older than Wahlberg (when in reality he's a year younger) and that just adds more to the authenticity.\n\nFrom the opening sequence, I was under the impression that 'The Fighter' was going to be a documentary-type movie but O. Russell tricks and surprises the audience with that. His execution is subtle unlike the loud approach which other directors commonly follow.\n\nFor me 'The Fighter', is more about the human connection than the sports itself. Boxing is clearly a metaphor as is the title which has multiple meanings. Even though he's been constantly let down by his family, Micky chose to give them a second chance and have them by his side. Even though Charlene disapproves Alice and Dicky's involvement in Micky's career, Dicky attempts to persuade her because he knows that Micky won't stand a chance without her by his side. Even though Alice and Charlene don't see eye to eye, there's a silent acceptance between them as they know that Micky needs them both.\n\nI am really beginning to have more respect for Mark Wahlberg for producing gems like this (in addition to some amazing TV-series like 'In Treatment', 'Boardwalk Empire' and 'Entourage') and his growth as an actor is obviously apparent (he just needs to avoid tripe like 'The Happening' at all costs).\n\n'The Fighter' is a winner on various levels."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":352164,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2010-12-17","keywords":"boxing,boxer,scantily clad female,panties,nipples visible through clothing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Fighter: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2330986777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk5ODc4ODk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA2NDk4Mw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk5ODc4ODk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA2NDk4Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A look at the early years of boxer "Irish" Micky Ward and his brother who helped train him before going pro in the mid 1980s."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0010736/","name":"Amy Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751102/","name":"David O.

Put the focus on Thor's baby brother.","reviewBody":""The lights always look brighter across the river." After saying the wrong things, Adam (Hemsworth) an up-and-coming employee at a powerful corporation finds himself and his friends out of a job. After the owner Nicolas Wyatt (Oldman) recruits him to spy on rival Jock Goddard (Ford) to find out what his company is coming up with Adam finds himself stuck in the middle of a dangerous game. When he wants out he realizes that it's not just his life is threatened unless he completes his task. I was looking forward to watching this for two reasons. Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, also Richard Dreyfuss is in this but in a lesser role. I cannot recall a movie they have been in that has been bad (Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was bad but its still Indiana Jones so I can't hate it and I blame Lucas for that anyway). I did find out how to mess up a movie with those two legendary actors...add baby Thor (Liam Hemsworth). I'm not saying he was a bad actor in this because it wasn't terrible but when you have those two in a movie and you make baby Thor the main focus you have screwed up somewhere. I'd compare this to the movie Son Of No One in the way that you have Ray Liotta and Al Pacino and you make Channing Tatum the focus. Nothing personal against Hemsworth or Tatum but when you have such high caliber actors why waste them? As far as this movie goes the scenes with Oldman and Ford are amazing as expected, as far as the rest goes it was slow, a little boring and not exciting at all. With the plot being about the seedy underworld of the cellphone app industry though you don't have much to work with. Overall, a movie that could have been so much better but ended up being almost not worth seeing. It pains me to do this but I give it a C.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36213,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-08-16","keywords":"spying,thumbprint,traffic,man wears a swimsuit,man wrapped in a towel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3075778073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyODQ4NTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyODQ4NTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The two most powerful tech billionaires in the world are bitter rivals with a complicated past.

My wife and I are in a similar situation, older, retired, and long-time married. Our daily life and conversations are not that different from what is depicted here.\n\nLesley Manville (early 60s) is Joan and Liam Neeson (late 60s) is her husband Tom. As the movie begins they are on one of their walks, her short legs must move almost twice as fast as his. After they cross the bridge and get to a certain tree they turn around and head back. About 12 months later the movie ends the very same way.\n\nIn between Joan discovers a lump in one of her breasts and this starts a series of doctor visits, hospital visits, treatments, and making unexpected new friends. The movie examines the relationship between the long-time married couple, their devotion to each other, their working together to get past this big speed bump in life.\n\nThis is a good movie, we enjoyed it at home on DVD from our public library.

My wife and I are in a similar situation, older, retired, and long-time married. Our daily life and conversations are not that different from what is depicted here.\n\nLesley Manville (early 60s) is Joan and Liam Neeson (late 60s) is her husband Tom. As the movie begins they are on one of their walks, her short legs must move almost twice as fast as his. After they cross the bridge and get to a certain tree they turn around and head back. About 12 months later the movie ends the very same way.\n\nIn between Joan discovers a lump in one of her breasts and this starts a series of doctor visits, hospital visits, treatments, and making unexpected new friends. The movie examines the relationship between the long-time married couple, their devotion to each other, their working together to get past this big speed bump in life.\n\nThis is a good movie, we enjoyed it at home on DVD from our public library. Romantic attraction is usually what gets a couple together but ordinary love is what keeps them together.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3697,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-06","keywords":"cancer,middle aged couple,chemotherapy,gay couple,hospital","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1637400345","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZlZjUzZjYtN2I3MC00MWQzLWI4Y2YtNWE1M2ZhMzk4ZGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZlZjUzZjYtN2I3MC00MWQzLWI4Y2YtNWE1M2ZhMzk4ZGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Joan and Tom have been married for many years.

It's just the right time to watch a movie like "Mossad" written and directed by Alon Gur Arye, a parody in the genre of the "Naked Gun" series that combined comedy and espionage made in the 1990s by the American ZAZ trio (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker), or of the British films that had as a hero Johnny English (played by Rowan Atkinson), back on screen last year. I saw the movie yesterday evening at its first or second public screening, before the official premiere, in a cinema hall that was full with an audience that reacted enthusiastically. I can bet that a new Israeli cult comedy is about to be born, and that Britain's secret agent Johnny English has now a serious Israeli rival in the secret agent Guy Moran (interpreted by Tsahi Halevi), equally ready to save the world risking to destroy it ten times.\n\nThe satirical arrows in this cinematic parody genre are usually directed towards two main directions - a "serious" theme from an area of activity with visibility and of major interest for the public (in this case the fight against terrorism and the secret wars led by the national spy organizations - Mossad, CIA) and the 'serious' movies related to this theme (here the action films and series such as 'James Bond', 'Mission Impossible', etc.). In order to succeed, such films should avoid dealing with any of the 'sacred cows' and should include as many jokes as possible with references to known realities or famous films, all packed in a story which aims to be coherent but is explicitly not taken too seriously. I think the screenwriter and director Alon Gur Arye has very honorably succeeded to meet these conditions and the result is a fun and engaging movie.\n\nThe pace of jokes and comic situations is considerable and these are present from the first frame before the generic to the last one at the final credits. I'm not convinced that everything will pass the screen to the international audiences, and as the screening had English subtitles I noticed that some adaptations are being attempted. The level of satire and critical humor dealing with the bombastic myths, local bureaucracy, or typology of secret war heroes did not seem to me to fall under anything else in the genre, the latest 'Johnny English', for example. I can say the same thing about the level of acting - Dvir Benedek and Tsahi Halevi are excellent in the key roles, the feminine presences are attractive and expressive, Tal Friedman creates an original role that makes us forget his appearances in popular comic television programs, and the Israeli screen and stage veterans Gila Almador and Ilan Dar act in the movie with obvious pleasure. They all have fun and make us have fun. The less successful parts of this film are related to the coherence of the action (there is no moment of real suspense) and the special effects that have suffered from a clear lack of funds, with results visible today in the era of spectacular graphic effects. These details cannot spoil too much of the pleasure I had watching "Mossad", which has good chances to be the summer blockbuster in Israel, and to be successful elsewhere and beyond its first season of screening.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":597,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-06-27","keywords":"parody,mossad,israel,airplane,reference to naked gun","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"MOSSAD!

How he walks, how he stands. I remember thinking that Jake Gyllenhaal had borrowed that physicality for his character in "Brokeback Mountain" and I just realized that Larry McMurtry is the author of both "Brokeback Mountain" and "Hud". He provides us with a look into the modern cowboy that is not only unique but mesmerizing. Paul Newman's Hud is a cad and yet you feel we sense that behind the bravado hides a desperate man looking for something. Something personal and unspoken. Hud is one of my favorite Newman performances. Soulless and yet needy.

How he walks, how he stands. I remember thinking that Jake Gyllenhaal had borrowed that physicality for his character in "Brokeback Mountain" and I just realized that Larry McMurtry is the author of both "Brokeback Mountain" and "Hud". He provides us with a look into the modern cowboy that is not only unique but mesmerizing. Paul Newman's Hud is a cad and yet you feel we sense that behind the bravado hides a desperate man looking for something. Something personal and unspoken. Hud is one of my favorite Newman performances. Soulless and yet needy. Is it a coincidence that the only woman that"got away" from Hud is named Alma? - Alma in Spanish means soul - Alma is played by Patricia Neal with power and humanity and she won the Oscar for it.

Complete with a typically Scandinavian atmosphere of understated emotion, this film isn't the hyperbolic drama it could have been in different hands, instead telling its story as quietly, yet honestly, as possible.\n\nDirector Grímur Hákonarson received strong acclaim around the world for his 2015 film, Rams, which also looks at life in Iceland's farming community. That film, though insightful and certainly atmospheric, wasn't a masterpiece of storytelling in my opinion, and often felt more drab than genuinely understated.\n\nThe County, however, is a step in the right direction. Certainly, the film is deliberately filled with rough edges. It moves at a slow pace, its setting is rugged, and it often gets very detailed with the nitty-gritty of the politics of farming - something that few other films are willing to do.\n\nAnd yet, this is never a boring watch. It's not a heart-stopping one either, but The County is meant to be an understated and affecting drama, and it achieves that for the most part.\n\nAbove all, the film's political edge is its most interesting line of focus. Though not entirely present in the early stages of the film, which looks more at grief and vulnerability, The County really steps up a gear in its middle act, taking aim at abusive and controlling organisations that pretend to be benevolent members of the community.\n\nAs I said, the nitty-gritty of how Icelandic farming cooperatives work may not be something you'd immediately think of as fascinating, but The County imbues that with real emotional depth, pitching the conflict between a frustrated farmer and an increasingly arrogant and uncontrollable organisation against the backdrop of personal loss.\n\nIn that, the film's overall arc comes together nicely, with a captivating blend of emotional and political drama. However, The County is just missing a small spark of life to really make it hit home.\n\nHákonarson's understated style shouldn't be criticised, after all it's what makes some of this film's most intimate and thought-provoking moments so powerful. However, this story, which to a degree looks at pent-up frustration, doesn't quite deliver that emotion as effectively as could be the case.\n\nThere's a part of me that wants this film to be a little like Wild Tales - a story of a normal person eventually having enough with the world and losing their cool. However, this is Iceland, not Argentina, and they deal with their frustration in a different way.\n\nSo, The County doesn't go to the hyperbolic lengths of Wild Tales, but in retaining such an understated style, it misses the opportunity to really get you on side with its main character, and sympathise with her enormous frustration and anger.\n\nArndís Hrönn Egilsdóttir gives an excellent performance throughout, it's just that the screenplay doesn't lend enough attention to her feelings of anger, instead putting more focus on the political connotations of the story. That's interesting in its own way, but I feel that a stronger display of anger in the screenplay could have been the difference between The County being a good film and a great film.\n\nStill, The County is undeniably a good film. Better than Rams with its blend of emotional and political drama, as well as a hint of exciting drama on the verge of exploding, it's a captivating watch throughout, albeit missing that extra spark of frustration and anger that could have made it even better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1096,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-14","keywords":"singing in a car,redheaded woman,reference to liverpool fc,reference to southampton fc,loss of husband","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi606518809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZiNzg1ZjgtMDZkNi00ZDY5LWEzMWQtODAyYmVjOTk2YzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1907967/","name":"Arndís Hrönn Egilsdóttir"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2855195/","name":"Sveinn Ólafur Gunnarsson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0045489/","name":"Þorsteinn Bachmann"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030799/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0453485/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0355821/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1963886/","name":"Grímur Hákonarson"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The film isn't deep, but i found it extremely effective in showing a simple story. The performances were real, even Biel was good here as was Evans and Statham who truly stole the show. I liked the screenplay a lot and the direction suited the film as well. I liked the cinematography from Jo Willems and the music by The Crystal Method. The film is a great 2 million dollar film, low budget, high quality, they should make more films like this.--- very good film from hunter richardsIMDb Rating: 6.0, my rating: 9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23066,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-09-03","keywords":"female rear nudity,bare butt,talking about sex,fetish sex,nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"London","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4086694169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg5MjZkODYtNWI1OC00NzdkLTg2MzUtMGIyYjA5YmJmNjY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg5MjZkODYtNWI1OC00NzdkLTg2MzUtMGIyYjA5YmJmNjY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Samuel Goldwyn","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004754/","name":"Jessica Biel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0262635/","name":"Chris Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1862705/","name":"Hunter Richards"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017834/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148701/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103690/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1862705/","name":"Hunter Richards"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Those who might dismiss Endeavour as just another generic addition to an already overcrowded marketplace, however, would be making a grievous error.\n\nThe year is 1965 and an eccentric young Detective Constable, Endeavour Morse (Shaun Evans), is making waves at the Oxford City Police with not only his unorthodox but brilliant methods of deduction, but for his refusal to tow the line in order to please the upper echelons of both the Force and society. Under the steadfast guidance of the seasoned and similarly incorruptible, Fred Thursday (Roger Allam), Morse finds himself embroiled in a number of complex cases that expose him to the darker side of life and human nature.\n\nAlthough the series will naturally draw comparisons to its popular predecessor, thanks to the show's gripping narratives, vibrant swinging sixties backdrop and perfect blend of light and dark overtones, Endeavour is easily able to distinguish itself by its own considerable merits. \n\nMuch of the show's success can be attributed to the ingenious casting of Evans, who puts his own unique stamp on the iconic role. Of course there are parallels to the world weary DI so expertly embodied by John Thaw, but Evans wisely avoids imitation, as the twenty-year age difference between the two interpretations allows the actor to create something fresh. The addition of the character of Fred Thursday is inspired. The street wise, war veteran is the perfect mentor for the idealistic Morse and their relationship is one of the highlights of the series. Fantastic entertainment on every level!\n\nhttp://infilmandtvland.wordpress.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22057,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A well performed, touching and interesting show caught my eye. The characters are involving, are worth caring about and have a strong sense of purpose. Each one brings something to the mix and adds their own skills to the events of each episode. Each episode has a strong mystery to be solved, sometimes offering an intriguing moral dilemma to both Murdoch and the viewer. It is also very reassuring to not have modern day morality thrust into the past as happens so frequently with other shows (yes 'Dr Quinn Medicine Woman', I mean you), dealing with the nineteenth century. Instead we are allowed to explore the world as they see it, enjoying the discoveries and trying to find a way forward into a new century. Well done to all concerned and long may it continue.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12047,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2008-01-01","keywords":"detective,police detective,morgue,police station,whodunit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084370/","name":"Yannick Bisson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431420/","name":"Helene Joy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186030/","name":"Thomas Craig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014501/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0382999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779939/","name":"Cal Coons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953567/","name":"Alexandra Zarowny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485610/","name":"Maureen Jennings"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2131996697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In fact, I truly believe that it is a small jewel and aspiring cult movie. The setting is surprisingly good, the script, based on a book by Guy Lyon Playfair (one of the Enfield investigators), is magnificent. It does not abuse of any special effects, and it does back to the typical horror- suspense movies of the 70's and 80's like "The Changeling" type. Now that all horror films are gore or a collection of special effects, that is thankful. In addition, the script is full of subtle comic moments, surreal even, perfectly matched with the suspense of the film, that far from falling into the "Scary Movie" manners, what it does is humanize the characters, make them closer to the viewer and endow them with a certain psychological depth; help to this the great performances (along with the great script), of practically all the actors and actresses of this, in my opinion, small great work of art. The girl who plays Janet (Eleanor Worthington Cox) and the actor who plays Grosse (Timothy Spall) are immeasurable, great. The background of the work transcends the simple entertainment cinema (which is, but with quality), and penetrates into areas such as the importance of attachment in relationships, love, youth and adolescence, the importance of family, etc ... Simply great, hopefully this type of cinema more personal (even if it is in the fantastic-terror terrain) popularizes and more works are done as well as this. It is not necessary to spend a million- euro in special effects in a movie so that it can turn out (this film is proof of it), in fact this film gains credibility by using the just and the just, sometimes very handmade. A film conceived for TV, very good and highly recommended!.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4488,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Drama","Horror"],"datePublished":"2015-05-03","keywords":"tv mini series,1970s,psychotronic series,based on true story","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001758/","name":"Timothy Spall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5732956/","name":"Eleanor Worthington-Cox","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0828980/","name":"Juliet Stevenson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197929/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Enfield Haunting","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi703642905","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFmZTdlZTQtZGEzOC00OTdiLTkxZGItYmQxMTA1OTliZjVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFmZTdlZTQtZGEzOC00OTdiLTkxZGItYmQxMTA1OTliZjVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Enfield Haunting"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The series is very reminiscent of Agatha Christie's "Marple" (with Geraldine McEwan ) and "Poirot" (with David Suchet). There's just something special about period murder mysteries, perhaps it's the lack of high tech machines that do our sleuthing for us, a la CSI, or maybe it's the romanticism of the period itself. Regardless, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries is expertly produced from exquisite wardrobe &amp; makeup, to lush shooting locations and breathtaking cinematography. Every element of the production is done with such attention to detail, you loose yourself in the story. The two leads, Essie Davis as Miss Phryne Fisher and Nathan Page as Detective Jack Robinson are perfect in their roles. Having watched each episode thus far, I cannot imagine anyone else portraying these delightful characters and their chemistry is undeniable. The entire cast is great, the characters are well thought out and multi-dimensional. The episodes are also well done, peppered with historical information and accuracy. I would highly recommend "Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries" to any mystery buff, it's a modern classic done in the period style of the roaring 20's.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14896,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-02-24","keywords":"liberated woman,australia,female protagonist,headstrong woman,detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204583/","name":"Essie Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656289/","name":"Nathan Page","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3793639/","name":"Hugo Johnstone-Burt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346452/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3789075225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Finding its stride in season 2 with a formula which pushes the envelope while still being doable, this series packs ample portions of entertainment into 40 minute episodes while staying fresh, delivering palatable doses of science didactically, and, most of all, manifesting a strong sense of social responsibility in all of its subliminals. While most entertainment aims for the crotch, the gut, or the heart, "CSI" goes for the most difficult target, the head, as it teaches forensics and the empirical process while remaining cooly detached from sensationalism and melodrama all the while using the "truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction" thesis to its and our advantage. The results are fun and interesting lessons in everything from dwarfism to Down syndrome to anatomy to ballistics to etc. all the while maintaining a social conscience. Whether explaining how S&amp;M is not necessarily perversion to simply dissing Don King, "CSI" is one sweet sugar coated education with solid mainstream values. My favorite lines? CSI1:"There's a sucker born every minute."  CSI2: "Yeah. And they all come to Vegas."

Both Allen and Jackson had private designated areas to take their victims for intimate "alone " time'. And the parents were somewhat aware or made aware of going ons but chose to be complacent. Now many will deny and make excuses for these two men because they were great entertainers . But a rapist doesn't' assault every woman. Dog abusers don't abuse every dog they own. And just because someone give millions to charity and claims to adore all children does not mean he didn't sexually abuse some.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary","Biography","Crime"],"datePublished":"2021-02-21","keywords":"tv mini series,child sexual abuse,me too movement,reference to woody allen,sexual grooming","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001201/","name":"Mia Farrow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0696660/","name":"Fletcher Previn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0642717/","name":"Dylan O'Sullivan Farrow"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139821/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242489/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0671377/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3880108313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZmODczNzctZTk0YS00ZjAyLTg3NWMtYWQ0ZTY0YzQyYTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZmODczNzctZTk0YS00ZjAyLTg3NWMtYWQ0ZTY0YzQyYTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Allen V.

The first episode had an intriguing premise, the second episode built up the team members' characters enough to at least make them likable, and I think Michael Weatherly is enjoying the role massively and it shows in his winning performance. The psychological aspect of the show is something I don't think we see enough of on television in general and even if some of it is pumped up into quick, flashy computer bites, it still aids the story which is really all it's meant to do. As shows in their infancy go, I think this one is off to a promising start.

The first episode had an intriguing premise, the second episode built up the team members' characters enough to at least make them likable, and I think Michael Weatherly is enjoying the role massively and it shows in his winning performance. The psychological aspect of the show is something I don't think we see enough of on television in general and even if some of it is pumped up into quick, flashy computer bites, it still aids the story which is really all it's meant to do. As shows in their infancy go, I think this one is off to a promising start. Bull is a well-shot bit of interesting fun and I will definitely keep watching!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16819,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830388/","name":"Jaime Lee Kirchner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Deseta sezona staroj ekipi donosi u život nove ljude poput djeteta Howarda i Bernadette, ali ljubavni problemi svih genijalaca su i dalje prisutni. U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

In Law &amp; Order, it was common for the initial suspect--a low level hood from the ghetto--to be innocent, with the ultimate criminal turning out to be a wealthy white executive/headmaster/philanthropist/politician/stereotypical elitist. By now, I expect any crime show on any network in the US and the UK to have ethnically diverse investigators reporting to a female commander. But as long as the plots make sense and the serious dialogue is leavened with humor, I can put up with all the calibrated political correctness. I've watched a lot of these shows over the years, notwithstanding their occasional triteness.\n\nThis show is PC on steroids. It's is the first show I've ever seen in which MS-13 members are victims. There is a point where the political messaging just gets so tiresome and tendentious that it results in ridiculous plots, terrible dialogue, and total inauthenticity.\n\nI hoped this show would be entertaining even if it wasn't exactly Masterpiece-just ordinary, decent TV. Instead. it is so stupid that it's unwatchable.

Shocking how bad this is. So disappointing!","reviewBody":"I expect a certain amount of political correctness from a Dick Wolf show. In Law &amp; Order, it was common for the initial suspect--a low level hood from the ghetto--to be innocent, with the ultimate criminal turning out to be a wealthy white executive/headmaster/philanthropist/politician/stereotypical elitist. By now, I expect any crime show on any network in the US and the UK to have ethnically diverse investigators reporting to a female commander. But as long as the plots make sense and the serious dialogue is leavened with humor, I can put up with all the calibrated political correctness. I've watched a lot of these shows over the years, notwithstanding their occasional triteness.\n\nThis show is PC on steroids. It's is the first show I've ever seen in which MS-13 members are victims. There is a point where the political messaging just gets so tiresome and tendentious that it results in ridiculous plots, terrible dialogue, and total inauthenticity.\n\nI hoped this show would be entertaining even if it wasn't exactly Masterpiece-just ordinary, decent TV. Instead. it is so stupid that it's unwatchable. How could a show with its pedigree go so wrong?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13074,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-25","keywords":"violence,police investigation,copaganda,fbi agent,fbi federal bureau of investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335291/","name":"Missy Peregrym","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4976368/","name":"Zeeko Zaki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1541762/","name":"Craig Turk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi251968281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things together about her suicide while a new resident moved into the neighborhood named Mike Delfino with a mysterious past. Is he a bad guy or a good guy? Or a bad guy doing a good thing? \n\nFirst what I really want to say for a non-spoiler review is that this series came out in 2004 and I decided to binge it in 2018 of June. It held up incredibly via Hulu. I was hooked after just 1 episode!! That's all it took. Also I should mention I'm a straight guy. This series is NOT JUST FOR WOMEN! There is much to love about this series that men will cherish. The comedy is incredible but the relatable situations are outstanding as well. The mysteries and intrigue are brilliant too. \n\nWhat's impressive about this series is that despite a big mystery hanging above, so much entertainment goes on that you forget about it and are captivated by each individual episode. I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least. (Watch a drama from then90s on network TV and then imagine it on that same channel take NYPD pilot for example) what I'm saying is it doesnt matter if this is old incredible!!!!\n\nThis series is a must-see that provides pure entertainment and laughs for you each episode and the first handful of seasons!!!\n\nI cant believe I almost never watched this gem of a series...what a exhilarating experience!!!

I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least. (Watch a drama from then90s on network TV and then imagine it on that same channel take NYPD pilot for example) what I'm saying is it doesnt matter if this is old incredible!!!!\n\nThis series is a must-see that provides pure entertainment and laughs for you each episode and the first handful of seasons!!!\n\nI cant believe I almost never watched this gem of a series...what a exhilarating experience!!!

This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things together about her suicide while a new resident moved into the neighborhood named Mike Delfino with a mysterious past. Is he a bad guy or a good guy? Or a bad guy doing a good thing? \n\nFirst what I really want to say for a non-spoiler review is that this series came out in 2004 and I decided to binge it in 2018 of June. It held up incredibly via Hulu. I was hooked after just 1 episode!! That's all it took. Also I should mention I'm a straight guy. This series is NOT JUST FOR WOMEN! There is much to love about this series that men will cherish. The comedy is incredible but the relatable situations are outstanding as well. The mysteries and intrigue are brilliant too. \n\nWhat's impressive about this series is that despite a big mystery hanging above, so much entertainment goes on that you forget about it and are captivated by each individual episode. I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least. (Watch a drama from then90s on network TV and then imagine it on that same channel take NYPD pilot for example) what I'm saying is it doesnt matter if this is old incredible!!!!\n\nThis series is a must-see that provides pure entertainment and laughs for you each episode and the first handful of seasons!!!\n\nI cant believe I almost never watched this gem of a series...what a exhilarating experience!!!

Now, that's the same character she plays in every film and every series she's ever been in. It's also the same persona she uses when she sings in her band, or gives interviews, or (I imagine) blogs about baking Dr. Seuss-themed cupcakes for a company of lumberjacks.\n\nDon't get me wrong - it works. For me. On so many levels. But the problem is that she is just so aware of it. She's a dazzling indie girl with a brain and a body, and my god does she know it. So a show completely focusing on that would be unbearable.\n\nBut surprisingly, this show isn't about that at all. It isn't even really about her character that much. Most of the comedy comes from the male characters, who are played by non-famous and extremely talented actors, and who find themselves in situations which as funny as they are fresh and relatable. \n\nSo, to reiterate, this is not a show about Zooey Deschanel. This is a show about life as a twenty-something in the twenty-first century. It's Friends except not set or made in the nineties. It's great and it makes me laugh a lot. And I highly recommend it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":205698,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-09-20","keywords":"loft,apartment building,female protagonist,roommate,teacher","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0221046/","name":"Zooey Deschanel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2159926/","name":"Jake Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339011/","name":"Max Greenfield"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0368370/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0363589/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2057975/","name":"Elizabeth Meriwether"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 6 New Girl--What's New","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1436923417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzMTU3Nzc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzMTU3Nzc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things together about her suicide while a new resident moved into the neighborhood named Mike Delfino with a mysterious past. Is he a bad guy or a good guy? Or a bad guy doing a good thing? \n\nFirst what I really want to say for a non-spoiler review is that this series came out in 2004 and I decided to binge it in 2018 of June. It held up incredibly via Hulu. I was hooked after just 1 episode!! That's all it took. Also I should mention I'm a straight guy. This series is NOT JUST FOR WOMEN! There is much to love about this series that men will cherish. The comedy is incredible but the relatable situations are outstanding as well. The mysteries and intrigue are brilliant too. \n\nWhat's impressive about this series is that despite a big mystery hanging above, so much entertainment goes on that you forget about it and are captivated by each individual episode. I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then.

This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things together about her suicide while a new resident moved into the neighborhood named Mike Delfino with a mysterious past. Is he a bad guy or a good guy? Or a bad guy doing a good thing? \n\nFirst what I really want to say for a non-spoiler review is that this series came out in 2004 and I decided to binge it in 2018 of June. It held up incredibly via Hulu. I was hooked after just 1 episode!! That's all it took. Also I should mention I'm a straight guy. This series is NOT JUST FOR WOMEN! There is much to love about this series that men will cherish. The comedy is incredible but the relatable situations are outstanding as well. The mysteries and intrigue are brilliant too. \n\nWhat's impressive about this series is that despite a big mystery hanging above, so much entertainment goes on that you forget about it and are captivated by each individual episode. I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then.

This woman was married and had a teenage boy, from this point on starts the mistery of why she killed herself. Her four best friends; Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Bree (Marcia Cross) start to put things together about her suicide while a new resident moved into the neighborhood named Mike Delfino with a mysterious past. Is he a bad guy or a good guy? Or a bad guy doing a good thing? \n\nFirst what I really want to say for a non-spoiler review is that this series came out in 2004 and I decided to binge it in 2018 of June. It held up incredibly via Hulu. I was hooked after just 1 episode!! That's all it took. Also I should mention I'm a straight guy. This series is NOT JUST FOR WOMEN! There is much to love about this series that men will cherish. The comedy is incredible but the relatable situations are outstanding as well. The mysteries and intrigue are brilliant too. \n\nWhat's impressive about this series is that despite a big mystery hanging above, so much entertainment goes on that you forget about it and are captivated by each individual episode. I cant believe it took me so long to watch this show but I honestly dont think I would have appreciated it as much in 2004 as a kid. I think all I would have thought about was the gardner and gabrielle having an affair but now I found I cared more about how she mainted to cover the secret as it happened and I started watching.\n\nDont think for a second because this series is from 2004 it may not be good because the best TV has come from the 90s and 2000s! That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least. (Watch a drama from then90s on network TV and then imagine it on that same channel take NYPD pilot for example) what I'm saying is it doesnt matter if this is old incredible!!!!\n\nThis series is a must-see that provides pure entertainment and laughs for you each episode and the first handful of seasons!!!\n\nI cant believe I almost never watched this gem of a series...what a exhilarating experience!!!

That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! \n\nWhen desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least. (Watch a drama from then90s on network TV and then imagine it on that same channel take NYPD pilot for example) what I'm saying is it doesnt matter if this is old incredible!!!!\n\nThis series is a must-see that provides pure entertainment and laughs for you each episode and the first handful of seasons!!!\n\nI cant believe I almost never watched this gem of a series...what a exhilarating experience!!!

His unflinching, brutally honest portrayals of flawed people make him popular with the indie crowd, but it's difficult to recommend his movies to anyone else. It's difficult not to identify with the parade of eternal losers of Solondz's movies, no matter how flawed they are, because, really, these people are us. We might try to deny it, of course, but the truth of the matter is that his movies are just too uncomfortably real for many people to enjoy. You might not be an awkward, depressed girl or an obnoxious, entitled man-child, but there's probably some aspect that you can relate to. If not, then you probably know someone like this. Solondz knows who we are, and he knows our society.\n\nDark Horse continues a rather surreal and artistic direction for Solondz. Fantasy, dreams, and reality all freely intermix. It might leave some audiences a bit confused, but it's usually pretty obvious which are which. In fact, I really enjoyed some of these scenes, because they opened the door to really inventive narrative and metaphor. In some ways, it was like David Lynch, but without the free-form stream-of-consciousness. These scenes really illustrate the characters better than any traditional scene could. The hilariously banal conversations are another nice touch. Anyone who appreciates irony will certainly enjoy them, though the irony-impaired, I think, will possibly hate this movie.\n\nSolondz's characters have arguably never before been so depressed, bitter, and broken. If you're looking for an uplifting story, full of inspirational and likable characters, this is not the movie for you. Solondz is the undisputed master of strangely sympathetic portraits of society's biggest losers and weirdos. This one will hit pretty close to home for many geeks.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-06-29","keywords":"hepatitis b,man wrapped in a towel,collectible,theater poster,poster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi516268569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkyNjU2MTgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgwMTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkyNjU2MTgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgwMTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Romance blooms between two thirty-somethings in arrested development: an avid toy collector who lives with his parents and a woman who is the dark horse of her family.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 1690455, Title: Dark Horse, 
 --- Description: Dark Horse: Directed by Todd Solondz. With Melisa Young, Jordan Gelber, Selma Blair, Mia Farrow. Romance blooms between two tricenarians in arrested development: an avid toy collector who is the dark horse of his family and a depressed woman on the rebound." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1690455/","name":"Dark Horse","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI5MDNjMDgtYjRlNy00ZGEyLWI3OTItZWIxYTcyY2FhNGU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"Romance blooms between two tricenarians in arrested development: an avid toy collector who is the dark horse of his family and a depressed woman on the rebound.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1690455/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"krachtm","dateCreated":"2013-03-31","inLanguage":"English","name":"Uncomfortable satire","reviewBody":"The plot: An obnoxious man-child attempts an ill-fated romance with an equally broken woman, while coming to certain realizations about his life.\n\nDark Horse is not an easy movie to watch, but when have any Todd Solondz movies been easy to watch? His unflinching, brutally honest portrayals of flawed people make him popular with the indie crowd, but it's difficult to recommend his movies to anyone else. It's difficult not to identify with the parade of eternal losers of Solondz's movies, no matter how flawed they are, because, really, these people are us. We might try to deny it, of course, but the truth of the matter is that his movies are just too uncomfortably real for many people to enjoy. You might not be an awkward, depressed girl or an obnoxious, entitled man-child, but there's probably some aspect that you can relate to. If not, then you probably know someone like this. Solondz knows who we are, and he knows our society.\n\nDark Horse continues a rather surreal and artistic direction for Solondz. Fantasy, dreams, and reality all freely intermix. It might leave some audiences a bit confused, but it's usually pretty obvious which are which. In fact, I really enjoyed some of these scenes, because they opened the door to really inventive narrative and metaphor. In some ways, it was like David Lynch, but without the free-form stream-of-consciousness. These scenes really illustrate the characters better than any traditional scene could. The hilariously banal conversations are another nice touch. Anyone who appreciates irony will certainly enjoy them, though the irony-impaired, I think, will possibly hate this movie.\n\nSolondz's characters have arguably never before been so depressed, bitter, and broken. If you're looking for an uplifting story, full of inspirational and likable characters, this is not the movie for you. Solondz is the undisputed master of strangely sympathetic portraits of society's biggest losers and weirdos. This one will hit pretty close to home for many geeks.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-06-29","keywords":"hepatitis b,man wrapped in a towel,collectible,theater poster,poster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi516268569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkyNjU2MTgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgwMTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkyNjU2MTgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgwMTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Romance blooms between two thirty-somethings in arrested development: an avid toy collector who lives with his parents and a woman who is the dark horse of her family.

And yet, despite poor motivation, all of the actors do outstanding jobs--from Brad Pitt to Henry Thomas to Aidan Quinn to Anthony Hopkins--hats off for some fine acting. But at the core of the movie is a hollow factor that fails to touch base or explain the events. The jumps in continuity are a bit baffling.\n\nOn the plus side, the war scenes are especially realistic--and it's nice to see Henry Thomas (the boy from E.T.) developing into a fine actor. The outdoor photography is awesome and the score by James Horner is an impressive one. Too bad the script was such a letdown.\n\nSumming up: a picture that can be enjoyed on its own terms--beautiful to look at but hollow inside.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":157222,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"1995-01-13","keywords":"f word,no opening credits,violence,sex scene,sexual positions","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Legends of the Fall","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4019519769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE3ODUxY2UtMzc0NS00YTc0LThjZGMtOGFiODdkODk4MTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE3ODUxY2UtMzc0NS00YTc0LThjZGMtOGFiODdkODk4MTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001644/","name":"Aidan Quinn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001880/","name":"Edward Zwick"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014925/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049012/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0793463/","name":"Susan Shilliday","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937074/","name":"William D.

His unflinching, brutally honest portrayals of flawed people make him popular with the indie crowd, but it's difficult to recommend his movies to anyone else. It's difficult not to identify with the parade of eternal losers of Solondz's movies, no matter how flawed they are, because, really, these people are us. We might try to deny it, of course, but the truth of the matter is that his movies are just too uncomfortably real for many people to enjoy. You might not be an awkward, depressed girl or an obnoxious, entitled man-child, but there's probably some aspect that you can relate to. If not, then you probably know someone like this. Solondz knows who we are, and he knows our society.\n\nDark Horse continues a rather surreal and artistic direction for Solondz. Fantasy, dreams, and reality all freely intermix. It might leave some audiences a bit confused, but it's usually pretty obvious which are which. In fact, I really enjoyed some of these scenes, because they opened the door to really inventive narrative and metaphor. In some ways, it was like David Lynch, but without the free-form stream-of-consciousness. These scenes really illustrate the characters better than any traditional scene could. The hilariously banal conversations are another nice touch. Anyone who appreciates irony will certainly enjoy them, though the irony-impaired, I think, will possibly hate this movie.\n\nSolondz's characters have arguably never before been so depressed, bitter, and broken. If you're looking for an uplifting story, full of inspirational and likable characters, this is not the movie for you.

My thought is, if you don't like it, don't watch it. I personally enjoy it, along with the Chicago franchise (Fire&amp;PD). The crossover events are especially fun to watch. Is the use of accurate information on medication always correct? I can't say as I am not a doctor. I watch it because I like the characters and the stories. I'm sure there could be improvements, as with most tv. But this is not a documentary, its meant for entertainment. At least the characters have back stories. Lives outside the hospital. Dick Wolf has smartly created a network of series that all intermingle and its interesting to see how the New York shows come into play with the Chicago shows. So, just try it.

My thought is, if you don't like it, don't watch it. I personally enjoy it, along with the Chicago franchise (Fire&amp;PD). The crossover events are especially fun to watch. Is the use of accurate information on medication always correct? I can't say as I am not a doctor. I watch it because I like the characters and the stories. I'm sure there could be improvements, as with most tv. But this is not a documentary, its meant for entertainment. At least the characters have back stories. Lives outside the hospital. Dick Wolf has smartly created a network of series that all intermingle and its interesting to see how the New York shows come into play with the Chicago shows. So, just try it.

His unflinching, brutally honest portrayals of flawed people make him popular with the indie crowd, but it's difficult to recommend his movies to anyone else. It's difficult not to identify with the parade of eternal losers of Solondz's movies, no matter how flawed they are, because, really, these people are us. We might try to deny it, of course, but the truth of the matter is that his movies are just too uncomfortably real for many people to enjoy. You might not be an awkward, depressed girl or an obnoxious, entitled man-child, but there's probably some aspect that you can relate to. If not, then you probably know someone like this. Solondz knows who we are, and he knows our society.\n\nDark Horse continues a rather surreal and artistic direction for Solondz. Fantasy, dreams, and reality all freely intermix. It might leave some audiences a bit confused, but it's usually pretty obvious which are which. In fact, I really enjoyed some of these scenes, because they opened the door to really inventive narrative and metaphor. In some ways, it was like David Lynch, but without the free-form stream-of-consciousness. These scenes really illustrate the characters better than any traditional scene could. The hilariously banal conversations are another nice touch. Anyone who appreciates irony will certainly enjoy them, though the irony-impaired, I think, will possibly hate this movie.\n\nSolondz's characters have arguably never before been so depressed, bitter, and broken. If you're looking for an uplifting story, full of inspirational and likable characters, this is not the movie for you. Solondz is the undisputed master of strangely sympathetic portraits of society's biggest losers and weirdos. This one will hit pretty close to home for many geeks.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-06-29","keywords":"hepatitis b,man wrapped in a towel,collectible,theater poster,poster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi516268569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkyNjU2MTgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgwMTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkyNjU2MTgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgwMTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Romance blooms between two thirty-somethings in arrested development: an avid toy collector who lives with his parents and a woman who is the dark horse of her family.

Having grown up with the original TV series, this movie really had some big shoes to fill out. And surprisingly enough, it managed to do so in a good enough way. But there were also aspects of the movie that were less than successful.\n\nFirst of all, Seth Rogen (playing Britt Reid/The Green Hornet). No, no, no. I know he was involved in directing and writing the movie and all, but he is not chiseled out for an action role of this caliber. I do admire his spirit and enthusiasm, but he is more suited for comedy movies. Seeing him in this role didn't go well with me. He did bring along some comedy, but it didn't work so well in this particular movie.\n\nAnd the scene at the beginning where Britt Reid was bringing home a woman and they went through the garage and sat in all the cars (showing them off for the audience, actually) in high-speed capture, what was up with that? Already at that point, the movie started to falter and crash.\n\nJay Chou (playing Kato) certainly had HUGE shoes to fill out after the original role was played by Bruce Lee. And actually Chou did a decent enough job, with good acting and well-choreographed action/fighting sequences. So hats off to him for that.\n\nHowever, the most memorable person in the movie was Christoph Waltz (playing Chudnofsky). He was fantastic as a villain and worked his role very well and very convincingly. Plus there was also a good sense of humor to his role, and it worked well.\n\nThe story told in the movie was fast-paced, captivating and interesting enough to keep you enthralled throughout the entire feature length.\n\nFor an action movie, then "The Green Hornet" is actually quite good. But for a follow-up to the legacy of the TV series, the movie is a mediocre attempt with good intentions. Had they cast someone else for Britt Reid, it would have worked much better. Now, I am not saying that Seth Rogen is a bad actor, he was just ill-suited for this role. "The Green Hornet" is good entertainment if you are in for an evening of action, corny one-liners and a trip down memory lane.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158277,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2011-01-12","keywords":"troubled production,younger version of character,non comic book superhero,green hornet character,character name as title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Green Hornet: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi21600537","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MDU2Mjc4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzk5MzIxNA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MDU2Mjc4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzk5MzIxNA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"By night, debonair newspaper publisher Britt Reid fights crime as a masked superhero known as The Green Hornet.

Having been born in the late 80's, I grew up in "Gremlins"-mania. The original classic of black humor and creature-feature thrills was everywhere... everyone loved it and everyone loved to watch it constantly. And as a young child, as much as I loved that brilliant first film, I equally loved it's twisted and demented follow up. I'd watch them back-to- back practically once a week when I was in Elementary school. They just worked so well together in my mind: a more subtle first film followed by a more over-the-top and in-your-face sequel chocked full of constant gags and twists. Then, about age 10 or 11, I stopped enjoying it. It's radical tonal departure from the original and seeming discontent with its predecessor just didn't sit well with me... it seemed so insane and ridiculous, I just stopped loving it. It felt too much like it was making fun of the original rather than honoring it, which I hated. \n\nIt wasn't until many years later, as a teen about to enter my 20's that I rediscovered it and gave it a chance...and I loved it more than I had ever imagined I would! And even to this day, my adoration for it continues to grow. Why? Because I realized those things I hated about it years prior were intentional. It was all part of the insane and all-encompassing sense of anarchy director Joe Dante was crafting with this wonderful sequel. I just wasn't mature enough to be in on the gag, and realize that this wasn't just a sequel- it was a brilliant satire filled with great themes based on American culture of the 90's, consumerism and media... and also just a darned well- constructed piece of self-parody. It's poking fun at its own existence as an unnecessary sequel to a self-contained film and just has fun using the concept as an excuse to deliver some biting commentary. And I do think that it may be one of the greatest under-appreciated sequels ever made.\n\nSeveral years after the events of the original, Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) and his girlfriend Kate (Phoebe Cates) have re-located to New York City and are both working for Clamp Enterprises, a company run by eccentric and amusingly naive millionaire Daniel Clamp. (John Glover) Coincidentally, it turns out that Gizmo- the adorable Mogwai- is being held captive for experimentation in the very same building. Soon enough, Billy and his former pet are reunited. But all is not well- an accident causes a new batch of Gremlins to emerge, and it's up to Billy, Kate, Gizmo, Clamp and the visiting Futtermans (Dick Miller, Jackie Joseph) to save the day once again.\n\nDirector Dante, along with screenwriter Charles S. Haas craft a deliciously subversive tale that builds off of what came before, but takes it in a wildly creative new direction. Story goes that Dante was simply not interested in making another "Gremlins", especially as every script that was turned in was just a carbon-copy of the original. It wasn't until he was given near full creative control that he stepped back into the director's chair. And thank the lord he did. From the opening minute of the film, you know you're in for something very unique. And almost each and every scene has some layer of parody, satire or commentary that will leave you howling with laughter. You know you're watching something special when there's an uproariously funny gag involving a cable network's "End of Civilization" video announcement being prepped to air and a prolonged sequence where a janitor bemoans the dog-eat-dog world of modern employment while Gizmo is besieged by his evil Mogwai offspring. Special props also go to the brilliant series of gags revolving around Clamp's decidedly inefficient "smart" building and a sequence that openly mocks the "three rules" established in the first film. There's some good, broad humor there.\n\nBeyond that, the rest of the production is just magnificent. The updated creature effects courtesy Rick Baker are a massive step-up, with each and every Gremlin and Mogwai seeming to have their own distinct look and personality. Jerry Goldsmith's score is a comical blast and a half. The cast is fabulous, with all returning actors given their moment to shine and new cast members being very likable and entertaining. Glover is wonderful as the oddball Clamp. Christopher Lee makes for a memorable foil as a deranged genetic research scientist whose work allows the Gremlins to mutate into amusing new forms. And Robert Prosky gives a sense of class as a television host who gets caught up in the action. And the cinematography is also very sharp and works wonders, perfectly complimenting director Dante's unique and quirky visual sensibilities.\n\n"Gremlins 2: The New Batch" might not be for everyone. It's complex and hard-hitting commentary will likely fly over the heads of many viewers, and its deliberately ridiculous and farcical style may turn off the more hardcore fanbase of the original. But if you have an open mind, this is a journey well worth taking.\n\nI give it a very good 8 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98724,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"1990-06-15","keywords":"hulk hogan,horror host,science runs amok,spider creature,turned to stone","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Gremlins 2: The New Batch","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2666708761","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWI2MDIzNjItY2I1Yi00OTQxLWIxOTEtZmRiNjQwOTNjNDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWI2MDIzNjItY2I1Yi00OTQxLWIxOTEtZmRiNjQwOTNjNDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002090/","name":"Zach Galligan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000121/","name":"Phoebe Cates"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005177/","name":"Howie Mandel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001102/","name":"Joe Dante"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005062/","name":"Chuck Jones"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0351919/","name":"Charles S.

This movie has a lot riding on it. Not only does director Dave Green have to right the wrongs of the first movie, but on top of that introduce new characters to the mix. First let's start with the positives. The actors playing the turtles shine again, playing off of each other brilliantly, making them all distinct and likable characters. Bebop and Rocksteady are great additions to the series,and feel pulled out right of the 80s cartoon. The CGI design and quality is noticeably improved, and the action sequences are well shot and fun to watch, especially one involving a Brazilian river and a tank. Megan Fox thankfully isn't given as much screen time as the first one and becomes a good side character that helps out when the script calls for it. And I have to mention the Kraang. They absolutely nailed it. Brad Garrett did a good job even though Pat Fraley is still my favorite. My only complaints are I wish the movie was longer, which would of helped give the film more room to breathe. I also felt Casey Jones and Shredder weren't used to their full potential. Despite this, I still found a ton of fun and respect towards the original 80s cartoon, and ask you to give this 2nd outing a chance, because nostalgia aside, this is, in my opinion, the first great TMNT movie.

This movie has a lot riding on it. Not only does director Dave Green have to right the wrongs of the first movie, but on top of that introduce new characters to the mix. First let's start with the positives. The actors playing the turtles shine again, playing off of each other brilliantly, making them all distinct and likable characters. Bebop and Rocksteady are great additions to the series,and feel pulled out right of the 80s cartoon. The CGI design and quality is noticeably improved, and the action sequences are well shot and fun to watch, especially one involving a Brazilian river and a tank. Megan Fox thankfully isn't given as much screen time as the first one and becomes a good side character that helps out when the script calls for it. And I have to mention the Kraang. They absolutely nailed it. Brad Garrett did a good job even though Pat Fraley is still my favorite. My only complaints are I wish the movie was longer, which would of helped give the film more room to breathe. I also felt Casey Jones and Shredder weren't used to their full potential. Despite this, I still found a ton of fun and respect towards the original 80s cartoon, and ask you to give this 2nd outing a chance, because nostalgia aside, this is, in my opinion, the first great TMNT movie.

The subtitle The Second Part is surely a half truth considering how this narrative slapped together by the original writers Christopher Miller and Phil Lord seems tacked on in a "Oh let's take a victory lap then" sense. The new director Mike Mitchell is planted into a zero sum game as he tries to reignite the novelty of the first film while propelling a more mature plot that Miller and Lord insisted on being needlessly convoluted.

This parasitic sequel will deliver many chuckles and feels to audiences that have already surrendered to the committee-made trajectory of the LEGO universe, but I feel somber for those choosing to double feature this lackadaisical copy with its bold predecessor.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60566,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-02-07","keywords":"lego,sequel,queen,spaceship,vampire","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2788407833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It's been five years since everything was awesome and the citizens are facing a huge new threat: LEGO DUPLO invaders from outer space, wrecking everything faster than they can rebuild.

The subtitle The Second Part is surely a half truth considering how this narrative slapped together by the original writers Christopher Miller and Phil Lord seems tacked on in a "Oh let's take a victory lap then" sense. The new director Mike Mitchell is planted into a zero sum game as he tries to reignite the novelty of the first film while propelling a more mature plot that Miller and Lord insisted on being needlessly convoluted. This sequel comes off as a afterthought worthy to stand beside the other spinoff LEGO films, but lacks all of the magic of its predecessor.\n\nThe magic present in The LEGO Movie resides in the playful allegory of capitalism mixed with the earned nostalgia of the animation's medium.

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say.

The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly.

Alfonso Cuaron, already a well-appreciated Director of artistic genius, takes us on this incredible journey with Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), who gets detached from her shuttle and has to find her way back home (towards Gravity). The harrowing situation itself is stupefying; the stunning visuals, the incredible acting, and the powerful background score just add to the horror. In this era of 3D movies, this is one of the few movies where the 3D effect actually contributes something to the storytelling aspect, as well as the gripping reality of the film. For most of us, this is the closest we can ever get to be in space; it suspends us in a state of weightlessness along with the jeopardized astronauts. \n\nThe acting by the lead, Sandra Bullock, is commendable; the natural portrayal of the character makes the situation more realistic. She single-handedly caries the movie on her shoulders.

Alfonso Cuaron, already a well-appreciated Director of artistic genius, takes us on this incredible journey with Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), who gets detached from her shuttle and has to find her way back home (towards Gravity). The harrowing situation itself is stupefying; the stunning visuals, the incredible acting, and the powerful background score just add to the horror. In this era of 3D movies, this is one of the few movies where the 3D effect actually contributes something to the storytelling aspect, as well as the gripping reality of the film. For most of us, this is the closest we can ever get to be in space; it suspends us in a state of weightlessness along with the jeopardized astronauts. \n\nThe acting by the lead, Sandra Bullock, is commendable; the natural portrayal of the character makes the situation more realistic. She single-handedly caries the movie on her shoulders. The well-timed bouts of humour by George Clooney's supporting character, the veteran astronaut Mathew Kowalsky, give us the only comic relief in an otherwise gloomy suspense thriller. The cameo by the ecstatic Indian astronaut singing around "Mera jootha hai Japani" in space was hilarious as well. \n\nOther than being an adventurous suspense thriller, the slow character- development helps us to form an emotional bond as well.

Mrs. Boss is actually called Sarah and is played by Nicole Kidman with the same air and tone of voice she's been giving us the whole decade.

Does this mean something to you? To me, it means that Luhrman's dream is a reality. Three hours of film and not getting tired one minute? Not feeling disgust when listening to cheesy phrases and watching excessively dramatic moments?

The genre has been pretty devoid of quality lately. So, I don't know if that plays a part or not and I really don't care at this point. I enjoyed everything about this movie. It has tremendous heart and charisma and it's so very easy to get caught up in to the lives of these characters. A certain degree of patience is required while viewing because some secondary characters that feel unnecessary to the story are worth getting to know.

Animators are puppeteers first. So if you asked an animator to come up with a story, naturally you will find two features: one would involve two on-screen characters, one the animator of the other. We have many jokes associated with how imperfectly the on-screen animator (our hero) works his puppet at first. Incidentally, this movie is preceded in the theater by a short: "Lifting." It features a novice "animator" of precisely this type, being graded. Notice the infinite panel of switches in that short.\n\nCount on Pixar to find yet another way to fold introspection into the form. This is elaborated by the character of a critic. We see him first in a coffin-like office. He's only capable of destruction it seems. Voiced by Peter O'Toole in a stentorian voice-about-theater, he likes what he sees (tastes). Its a great trick you see. Usually this trick is in the form of an on screen audience watching some sort of climactic performance. When they cheer, we do too, as we become folded into the story.\n\nIn this case, that is handled by a place made for us and occupied by "the critic." So we have a place in the story for the animator and the viewer. What else? We'll need a place for the animation, right? And we have it.\n\nIt appears first as a book by a now dead, corpulent chef. This book, natch, comes alive. Look how "Ted's law" is followed: the distance between the "real" world of ourselves and the animated movie is the same as that from the animated movie and the "living cartoon" within. Its an explicit fold. And the fact that the inner cartoon has an open, personal feel to it conveys to the personal feel we are intended to have with the Pixar movie.\n\nSo these three folds: in the story is the story, the animator and the viewer. And the introductory short sets this up too.\n\nHaving said that, there are a couple noteworthy segments. In terms of the actual craft, Pixar has two areas in which it innovates.\n\nOne of these in how space is handled. The Pixar guys realized early on that if the three dimensions are going to be modeled anyway, you can zip the camera around in new ways. Early in the game they did this in an overt way. That's been picked up by the summer action films, the best of them, including the Depp pirate business. (Another Disney project benefiting from the eye motion lab.)\n\nYou can see this throughout the project: there are both all sorts of well managed, unusual perspectives, and a constant overlay of new shots. By this I mean that every shot is just a little different than what you've seen. Just a little canted. A little closer perhaps. A little movement that a physical camera cannot do well.\n\nBut there are some big production sequences as well. I'm particularly interested in architectural water. Its a unique cinematic challenge. Its not one done well in animation because the mathematics of simply making water look real is daunting. Pixar has done what needs to be done: they have made water hyper-real, dramatic. There's a sequence here that is something like that Pinnochio sequence of 67 years ago with the whale. But its so new and fresh and exciting. Look at the water and see that it has a million tiny agents all seeking to be angry  to do damage but never reaching consensus on just how to attack. This alone is worth the admission.\n\nThere's another thing that is uniquely Pixar: how characters move. Its a tricky thing, that. As with the water, it is not ever enough that they move realistically. You can make realistic movements by outfitting actors with sensors and translating that to the created beings. It captures nuance. And if you have a particularly skilled source actor, he or she will move not as a real person would, but as an actor would to convey reality. Real isn't real. We need hyperreal in special ways to get- read the reality.\n\nThe credits of this movie ostentatiously say that ""Our Quality Assurance Guarantee: 100% Genuine Animation! No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film." You can see it. We are entering a new era where both the cameras and the characters can use dramatic motions not possible with human eyes and bodies.\n\nIts a challenge for viewers. What do we accept as embodiment? So far, the answer is that the non-natural movements must always be in the service of conveying or seeming natural. But I imagine at the speed this is developing, we may soon see something more.\n\nOne character note: Colette is voiced by the remarkable Janeane Garofalo. As with our hero, she has that French nose. As the love develops between these two, she becomes decidedly more sexy, both in voice and appearance. Its the appearance that I remark on here. Its all done with postures and a motorcycle. That motorcycle is there in part to allow her to bend forward, and change her lower anatomy. \n\nThese folks at Pixar are good. Darn good. Glad its Steve Jobs as the creative inspiration instead of that evil other guy.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":672861,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2007-08-22","keywords":"rat,chef,ratatouille,cooking,paris france","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ratatouille","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi906147865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU0YmUzZTQtZDU4ZS00NWYxLWJlNDMtOWE0ZWIzOGJmODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU0YmUzZTQtZDU4ZS00NWYxLWJlNDMtOWE0ZWIzOGJmODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #2, Post"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004951/","name":"Brad Garrett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738918/","name":"Lou Romano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652663/","name":"Patton Oswalt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083348/","name":"Brad Bird"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684342/","name":"Jan Pinkava"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083348/","name":"Brad Bird"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684342/","name":"Jan Pinkava"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135296/","name":"Jim Capobianco"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Animators are puppeteers first. So if you asked an animator to come up with a story, naturally you will find two features: one would involve two on-screen characters, one the animator of the other. We have many jokes associated with how imperfectly the on-screen animator (our hero) works his puppet at first. Incidentally, this movie is preceded in the theater by a short: "Lifting." It features a novice "animator" of precisely this type, being graded. Notice the infinite panel of switches in that short.\n\nCount on Pixar to find yet another way to fold introspection into the form. This is elaborated by the character of a critic. We see him first in a coffin-like office. He's only capable of destruction it seems. Voiced by Peter O'Toole in a stentorian voice-about-theater, he likes what he sees (tastes). Its a great trick you see. Usually this trick is in the form of an on screen audience watching some sort of climactic performance. When they cheer, we do too, as we become folded into the story.\n\nIn this case, that is handled by a place made for us and occupied by "the critic." So we have a place in the story for the animator and the viewer. What else? We'll need a place for the animation, right? And we have it.\n\nIt appears first as a book by a now dead, corpulent chef. This book, natch, comes alive. Look how "Ted's law" is followed: the distance between the "real" world of ourselves and the animated movie is the same as that from the animated movie and the "living cartoon" within. Its an explicit fold. And the fact that the inner cartoon has an open, personal feel to it conveys to the personal feel we are intended to have with the Pixar movie.\n\nSo these three folds: in the story is the story, the animator and the viewer. And the introductory short sets this up too.\n\nHaving said that, there are a couple noteworthy segments. In terms of the actual craft, Pixar has two areas in which it innovates.\n\nOne of these in how space is handled. The Pixar guys realized early on that if the three dimensions are going to be modeled anyway, you can zip the camera around in new ways. Early in the game they did this in an overt way. That's been picked up by the summer action films, the best of them, including the Depp pirate business. (Another Disney project benefiting from the eye motion lab.)\n\nYou can see this throughout the project: there are both all sorts of well managed, unusual perspectives, and a constant overlay of new shots. By this I mean that every shot is just a little different than what you've seen. Just a little canted. A little closer perhaps. A little movement that a physical camera cannot do well.\n\nBut there are some big production sequences as well. I'm particularly interested in architectural water. Its a unique cinematic challenge. Its not one done well in animation because the mathematics of simply making water look real is daunting. Pixar has done what needs to be done: they have made water hyper-real, dramatic. There's a sequence here that is something like that Pinnochio sequence of 67 years ago with the whale. But its so new and fresh and exciting. Look at the water and see that it has a million tiny agents all seeking to be angry  to do damage but never reaching consensus on just how to attack. This alone is worth the admission.\n\nThere's another thing that is uniquely Pixar: how characters move. Its a tricky thing, that. As with the water, it is not ever enough that they move realistically. You can make realistic movements by outfitting actors with sensors and translating that to the created beings. It captures nuance. And if you have a particularly skilled source actor, he or she will move not as a real person would, but as an actor would to convey reality. Real isn't real. We need hyperreal in special ways to get- read the reality.\n\nThe credits of this movie ostentatiously say that ""Our Quality Assurance Guarantee: 100% Genuine Animation! No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film." You can see it. We are entering a new era where both the cameras and the characters can use dramatic motions not possible with human eyes and bodies.\n\nIts a challenge for viewers. What do we accept as embodiment? So far, the answer is that the non-natural movements must always be in the service of conveying or seeming natural. But I imagine at the speed this is developing, we may soon see something more.\n\nOne character note: Colette is voiced by the remarkable Janeane Garofalo. As with our hero, she has that French nose. As the love develops between these two, she becomes decidedly more sexy, both in voice and appearance. Its the appearance that I remark on here. Its all done with postures and a motorcycle. That motorcycle is there in part to allow her to bend forward, and change her lower anatomy. \n\nThese folks at Pixar are good. Darn good. Glad its Steve Jobs as the creative inspiration instead of that evil other guy.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":672861,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2007-08-22","keywords":"rat,chef,ratatouille,cooking,paris france","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ratatouille","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi906147865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU0YmUzZTQtZDU4ZS00NWYxLWJlNDMtOWE0ZWIzOGJmODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU0YmUzZTQtZDU4ZS00NWYxLWJlNDMtOWE0ZWIzOGJmODM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #2, Post","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004951/","name":"Brad Garrett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738918/","name":"Lou Romano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652663/","name":"Patton Oswalt"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083348/","name":"Brad Bird","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684342/","name":"Jan Pinkava"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0083348/","name":"Brad Bird","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684342/","name":"Jan Pinkava","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135296/","name":"Jim Capobianco"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?\n\nThis film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I'm still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I'd say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the "real" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That's a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn't even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento's soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.\n\nI have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there's some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out "form of a gundam" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn't been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn't. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky ("Oh God, it's f*%@ing Chucky" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).\n\nBut to say that this is nothing but leaching off others' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.\n\nThe characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \n\n And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"player,based on novel,screenplay adapted by author,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.\n\nThe characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \n\n And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"player,based on novel,screenplay adapted by author,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?\n\nThis film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I'm still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I'd say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the "real" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That's a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn't even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento's soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.\n\nI have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there's some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out "form of a gundam" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn't been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn't. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky ("Oh God, it's f*%@ing Chucky" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).\n\nBut to say that this is nothing but leaching off others' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.\n\nThe characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \n\n And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"player,based on novel,screenplay adapted by author,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

KAD PADNE MRAK u dokumentarnom stilu prikazuje svakodnevan (odnosno, svakonoćni) život troje vampira koji zajedno "žive" stotinama godina. Na Staten Islandu. Samoproglašeni vođa grupe je "Nandor Nemilosrdni", veliki ratnik i osvajač iz Osmanskog carstva. Zatim je tu britanski vampir "Laszlo" - pomalo vucibatina, dendi i kicoš, da se poslužimo njegovim riječima. A tu je i "Nadja": zavodnica, napasnica, vampirska Bonnie Laszloovom Clydeu. Nakon neočekivanog posjeta njihova mračnog gospodara i vođe, "Baruna Afanasa", vampire se podsjeća na njihov primarni zadatak koji su dobili kada su stigli na Staten Island prije više od stotinu godina - potpuna i cjelovita dominacija nad Novim svijetom. Ali koji je zapravo najbolji način za ostvarenje takve dominacije?</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Danny McBride ("Zamjenici") vraća se na HBO humorističnom serijom o svjetski poznatoj televangelističkoj obitelji s dugom tradicijom devijantnosti, pohlepe i dobrotvornog rada - sve u ime Isusa. Danny McBride ("Zamjenici") vraća se na HBO humorističnom serijom o svjetski poznatoj televangelističkoj obitelji s dugom tradicijom devijantnosti, pohlepe i dobrotvornog rada - sve u ime Isusa Krista. McBride će glumiti glavni lik Jesseja Gemstonea, koji sebe smatra osobenjakom među propovjednicima preuzevši ono što je njegov otac Eli Gemstone (John Goodman) izgradio i proširivši to za moderniju publiku. Glumačka postava također uključuje Edi Patterson kao Jessejevu sestru Judy; Cassidy Freeman kao Jessejevu ženu Amber; Tonyja Cavalera kao bivšeg sotonista Keefea Chambersa, kojega je spasio Jessejev mlađi brat Kelvin (Adam Devine); Tima Baltza kao Judyna zaručnika B. J.-a; i Grega Alana Williamsa kao Martina Imarija, konzervativnoga Kenijca i Elievu desnu ruku.</desc>

Think "Chocolat". Think "Amelie". Think "What dreams may come". Perhaps even, "Being John Malkovich". And this year, it's time to think big... "Big Fish", to be precise. All four of these movies have some things in common. Merely describing the premise is not nearly enough to do justice to the mood of the film. And the mood, the emotional reaction of the audience, is in many ways much more important than the actual content. Still, there's no way around it in a proper review: We meet a disillusioned young man and his father, a charming old guy who knows exactly how to tell stories to fascinate first-time listeners and children. Unfortunately, there's barely any of those left, as he retold his magical stories once too often. When his health and life are beginning to fade away, his son wants to finally learn the truth about his father. Meanwhile, we hear his life story, as he tells it... Tim Burton is probably best-known for visual eye candy movies. Few directors can compete with the imagination he's shown in movies like Batman, Nightmare before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. Outside the realm of darker, more gothic visuals, Tim Burton has so far been somewhat less prolific. Planet of the Apes was an expensive embarrassment, and Ed Wood is a decidedly acquired taste. Big Fish, then, is a new direction for him. Yes, it is eye candy, or perhaps even eye H"agen Dazs. But this time, the movie has much more of a soul than his monkeyplanet. This soul is achieved by two means: a great story (or collection of stories) and great acting. If you don't believe that the story is great, watch the audience. At key moments, everyone was chuckling or laughing, at others, I heard dozens of sniffs and tissues being unpacked around me. Yes, this is heartwarming stuff that a colder, more cynical soul would call cheese. Finally, Burton has found a story worthy of his talents again. And, better yet, he did not forget to encourage his cast to act. For a case study of such failure, see Christina Ricci's completely flat performance in Sleepy Hollow. In Big Fish, the cast is so carefully selected that failure is simply not an option. Ewan McGregor (playing the father in his youth) may not have much more to do than smile, be charming and sustain a Southern US accent, but he does it brilliantly. Much more important are the performances of Albert Finney and Jessica Lange, playing the aged father and mother, respectively. And they both deliver character performances worthy of prizes.\n\nAfter cheerleading so enthusiastically for this movie, perhaps it is time to take a step back and look at it from a more critical perspective. Yes, it managed to enchant the audience, but it did so the Hollywood way. Special effects and big budget feature heavily. This is in stark contrast to the seemingly much less organized and much more intuitional charm of Amelie. This movie is also much more comfy about its pace - it takes its time just like a good storyteller would, but perhaps leaving behind the five-second-attention-span MTV generation kids in the process. On the other hand, I am tempted to say that its biggest vice is that there just isn't enough of it. Given the episodal structure of this movie, I can almost imagine what it would have felt like as TV series, or multi-part TV movie. I am not sure whether to wish for this to happen or shudder at the thought of "Big Fish: The Animated Series" or some such atrocity. Every story told in this movie is perfect, and a series of such perfect stories would be wonderful. Yet can perfection be sustained for a large number of stories?

I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the 'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, "This is it! This is the movie!" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan's decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that you really don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'm definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1365346,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2005-06-16","keywords":"superhero,social decay,dc comics,gotham,well","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"4K Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi362988313","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJhYTcxYzgtOTI3My00ZTI1LWI3NzAtZTljMTFjM2ViOGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJhYTcxYzgtOTI3My00ZTI1LWI3NzAtZTljMTFjM2ViOGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg","description":"After training with his mentor, Batman begins his fight to free crime-ridden Gotham City from corruption."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000323/","name":"Michael Caine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913822/","name":"Ken Watanabe"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038332/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004170/","name":"Bob Kane"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275286/","name":"David S.

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":691185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":691185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"],"duration":"PT2H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The vacationers include the Mossbacher family - Nicole (Connie Britton), a successful type-A exec, who can't help but treat her family like disobedient employees; her husband, Mark (Steve Zahn), dealing with both an embarrassing health crisis and a terminal inferiority complex; their teenaged son, Quinn (Fred Hechinger), a socially awkward gamer, experiencing the wonder of nature for the very first time; their daughter, Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), and her friend, Paula (Brittany O'Grady), sharp-tongued college sophomores who cast a sardonic eye on the lifestyles and belief systems of everyone around them.  The handsome, entitled Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) is here with his beautiful bride, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario).  Shane and Rachel are in the throes of young love, but as they get to know each other better in this new, intimate environment, clouds of doubt appear - and by the time Shane's intrusive mother, Kitty (Molly Shannon) surprises them with an unwelcome visit, their fairytale honeymoon has begun to unravel. And finally, there is Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge), a wealthy, unstable woman, recovering from the death of her mother, traveling alone to the hotel, looking for love and in desperate need of a massage."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The vacationers include the Mossbacher family - Nicole (Connie Britton), a successful type-A exec, who can't help but treat her family like disobedient employees; her husband, Mark (Steve Zahn), dealing with both an embarrassing health crisis and a terminal inferiority complex; their teenaged son, Quinn (Fred Hechinger), a socially awkward gamer, experiencing the wonder of nature for the very first time; their daughter, Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), and her friend, Paula (Brittany O'Grady), sharp-tongued college sophomores who cast a sardonic eye on the lifestyles and belief systems of everyone around them.  The handsome, entitled Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) is here with his beautiful bride, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario).  Shane and Rachel are in the throes of young love, but as they get to know each other better in this new, intimate environment, clouds of doubt appear - and by the time Shane's intrusive mother, Kitty (Molly Shannon) surprises them with an unwelcome visit, their fairytale honeymoon has begun to unravel. And finally, there is Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge), a wealthy, unstable woman, recovering from the death of her mother, traveling alone to the hotel, looking for love and in desperate need of a massage."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">Možete pratiti jednu od najpopularnijih svjetskih serija"Seks i grad", koja prati živote četiri urbane žene i najbolje prijateljice iz New Yorka. Možete pratiti jednu od najpopularnijih svjetskih serija "Seks i grad", koja prati živote četiri urbane žene i najbolje prijateljice iz New Yorka u potrazi za ljubavlju, stabilnom vezom, razumjevanjem, seksom... Carrie Bradshaw je njujorška novinarka koja svoja opažanja o ljubavi i strasti objavljuje u kolumni "Seks i grad". Inspiracije joj ne nedostaje, jer sve što mora jeste saslušati svoje prijateljice dok joj se povjeravaju ili prepričavaju svoj posljednji izlazak. Uz nju su Samantha, vlasnica PR agencije, koja je na samačkoj sceni vidjela i isprobala sve, galeristica Charlotte koja još vjeruje da ljubav pobjeđuje sve i cinična Miranda, advokatica u velikoj kompaniji koja ima najmanje vremena za romanse, jer joj je karijera ispred nestabilnog ljubavnog života. Tema za Carriene kolumne je i Faca, zgodni i misteriozni tajkun koji joj uvijek ubrza otkucaje srca. Kristin Davis, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon i Sarah Jessica Parker uče nas važne lekcije o seksu, ljubavi, muškim i ženskim tajnama, uspješnim i neuspješnim taktikama, ispunjenim očekivanjima, skrivenim strahovima. Kada su u pitanju muškarci, veze i odnosi, ne možemo a da se ne zapitamo - da li smo zaista naučili sve?</desc>

It has good humour, plenty of violence, bad language, stunning cinematography and perfect pacing. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn't enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation. \n\nFirst off, the casting and character selection is very impressive, Colin Firth in particular shows us again his splendid acting abilities. He is the perfect choice for the role he played, in my opinion. The lead character, who the story focuses around - Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton), does a good job playing his character, although I personally found him very irritating. He plays a young chavvy youth, making the transition from street kid to secret agent. He brings the urban language, attitude and temperament to the service which is very out of place but necessary for the story. Samuel L Jackson plays the bad guy very well. The quirkiness and style portrayed is fun to see and fits the style of the movie well. Michael Caine, Mark Strong and all the other supporting cast don't feel out of place (if not a little stereotypical from some of them), they still do a notable job.\n\nIt is refreshing to see a movie of this genre so well made with a strong cast, not hold back when it comes to violence. The violence in the movie is one of the most inspiring aspects, it isn't over the top and you never feel like it has gone 'too far' but it is certainly more graphic than your average mainstream movie of this genre. There is a church scene in particular which stands out for me, it has a perfectly choreographed, one camera shot, fluid moving scene which is simply perfect. It's violent, with some surprisingly fresh martial arts and a cool choice of music to go with it!\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service is different to your usual run of the mill spy movie. It's hard to explain until you watch it, but it's got a certain spin on it, it's quirky, funny and makes many references to other spy movies and how this is a parody. Not in the sense of Austin Powers but it does make tongue in cheek references to James Bond, with some striking similarities. It has style, a fun and quirk edge and it is beautifully made with a plausible run time of just under 2 hours. Believe the hype and give this movie a watch. It's definitely worth your time!\n\n8/10\n\nP.S.

The characters either make or break a show like this, and in this case, the actors and their characters bring the entire story up. For example, the kid math-savant, a tough female DOD agent, Henry the quasi-mechanic, the tough deputy Lupo and an all-American US Marshall, who is the normal guy and now the Sheriff of Eureka. There are others of course and I am hoping the show hangs on long enough to develop a following. The setting is perfect. The writer's foreshadowing worked like a charm. Many things I assume will be happening. As I was watching, I kept saying, where's the villain?? And at the end of the first episode, a sweet villain was revealed, and in such a way -- you had to go --- Whoa -- very nice. The actor playing Jack Carter was perfectly chosen to act as us in this strange little story. Briefly, a small town hosts the world's most shining minds as they experiment and tinker with science and it's up to the normal people to keep the brains on the right path. I am so looking forward to the next installment. My hats off to the creative team -- this is just what I needed. Let's all hope we don't lose this show in the most important early stages. Ratings are King and just because it's good doesn't mean it will last. So fan boys gravitate to this show on Tuesdays on the best channel on the planet -- sci-fi!!\n\nAddition: Just saw the sixth episode. This is a show that keeps topping itself, introducing new and deeper sub-plots and literally has a dream cast. You will fall in love with Eureka.\n\nHere we are at the third season and it has only gotten better and better. This season everything's been kicked up a notch, I cannot believe the storyline of Nathan. I stand in awe of the writers, and as always one of the best TV casts in history.\n\nFourth Season opener: While most shows hit a slump in their 4th outing, Eureka raises the bar.

For example, the kid math-savant, a tough female DOD agent, Henry the quasi-mechanic, the tough deputy Lupo and an all-American US Marshall, who is the normal guy and now the Sheriff of Eureka. There are others of course and I am hoping the show hangs on long enough to develop a following. The setting is perfect. The writer's foreshadowing worked like a charm.

And at the end of the first episode, a sweet villain was revealed, and in such a way -- you had to go --- Whoa -- very nice. The actor playing Jack Carter was perfectly chosen to act as us in this strange little story. Briefly, a small town hosts the world's most shining minds as they experiment and tinker with science and it's up to the normal people to keep the brains on the right path. I am so looking forward to the next installment. My hats off to the creative team -- this is just what I needed. Let's all hope we don't lose this show in the most important early stages.

The dialogue is deeply cheesy and often terrible. The special effects are atrocious. And season four has developed the unfortunate habit of winking to its fans a little too often.\n\nAnd yet, the whole thing has such effusive love both in front of and behind the camera that I can't help but be caught up by it. The actors are clearly having the time of their lives with goofy material, and that enthusiasm is infectious.

STOP, read that line one more time. I ask you to do this because you will probably never see this again.\n\nThis was a sports film, for me to say that it wasn't would be a bold faced lie. This had all the characteristics of the modern Hollywood sports film, but what made it stand out and enjoyable is that it did not take itself seriously   AND   it had some amazing CGI action sequences. I recently watched a film called Equilibrium where it was mentioned that it could rival the popularity of The Matrix, well I would have to say that perhaps this film, Siu lam juk kau, would probably do more in toppling the king of bullet-time cinematography than Equilibrium would. I was impressed from the beginning till the end of this movie. The characters were all animated and individual in their own way. There was time used to set them up and learn about each of them. This wasn't one of those films where you spent most of your time with one of the characters then never really got to know the rest of them   you knew them all and couldn't wait to see what they were going to bring to the table next. Hong Kong has crafted a spectacular film here. They have taken the popularity of the bullet-time effect and applied it to a genre that definitely needed a face-lift. I am surprised that America wasn't the first to do this, but we are a nation that loves the standard sports film, so why change what we love. PWFSSSST. We are so lazy sometimes.\n\nSiu lam juk kau tells a spectacular story coupled with some amazing graphics to create a story about love, teamwork, and superpowers. I also enjoyed the fact that this film also tried to say that kung-fu is not an old topic, that it can and should still be used in society today. When we think of the martial arts films (and physical aspect), we see them as a very old and dated genre. Well, let me be the first to say that they are coming back, and coming back with a vengeance. I enjoyed the fact that this was a revenge film. So many of our kung-fu films are revenge films, I was happy to see that this one was not far off. This film used techniques that I have not seen used in any other films. They took the old, skillful ways of the dated kung-fu film, added the work of bullet-time, and added the sports flare to it to create Siu lam juk kau. It had us laughing, it kept us based in reality, and it focused my attention to the screen for the entire film (a task that no other sports film has been able to do). I think that by having your star also direct it (directed and starred Stephen Chow) it builds upon a sense of comfortability with the story. Chow is a master of slapstick, yet seldom overdoes the silliness, choosing carefully timed gags and meticulously mounted visual construction over slapdash comedy. The film is also no stranger to the bizarre, with Chow's multiple homages to Steven Spielberg, and a weird egg gag that I'm honestly shocked still remains the American cut of the picture.\n\nOverall, Siu lam juk kau is a amazing combination of comedy, action, romance, and dazzling soccer footage, forming an irresistible package to those looking for something they haven't seen before. We see that it is a personal story that everyone is having fun being a part of. That also helped this film   the characters really wanted to be in this film and it shined like the North Star through our screen. The dubbing (which seemed off a couple times) only added delight to this film. Chow's Siu lam juk kau, is and will always be breathtaking.\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77527,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"football","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shaolin Soccer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi550542873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiMjFiNzgtMjg3MS00NWU2LWJlZTItODQ0NDE5OGRlYTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiMjFiNzgtMjg3MS00NWU2LWJlZTItODQ0NDE5OGRlYTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955505/","name":"Wei Zhao"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939431/","name":"Yat-Fei Wong"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0302241/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032768/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874683/","name":"Kan-Cheung Tsang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298676/","name":"Min-Hun Fung"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I am surprised that America wasn't the first to do this, but we are a nation that loves the standard sports film, so why change what we love. PWFSSSST. We are so lazy sometimes.\n\nSiu lam juk kau tells a spectacular story coupled with some amazing graphics to create a story about love, teamwork, and superpowers. I also enjoyed the fact that this film also tried to say that kung-fu is not an old topic, that it can and should still be used in society today. When we think of the martial arts films (and physical aspect), we see them as a very old and dated genre. Well, let me be the first to say that they are coming back, and coming back with a vengeance. I enjoyed the fact that this was a revenge film. So many of our kung-fu films are revenge films, I was happy to see that this one was not far off. This film used techniques that I have not seen used in any other films. They took the old, skillful ways of the dated kung-fu film, added the work of bullet-time, and added the sports flare to it to create Siu lam juk kau. It had us laughing, it kept us based in reality, and it focused my attention to the screen for the entire film (a task that no other sports film has been able to do). I think that by having your star also direct it (directed and starred Stephen Chow) it builds upon a sense of comfortability with the story. Chow is a master of slapstick, yet seldom overdoes the silliness, choosing carefully timed gags and meticulously mounted visual construction over slapdash comedy. The film is also no stranger to the bizarre, with Chow's multiple homages to Steven Spielberg, and a weird egg gag that I'm honestly shocked still remains the American cut of the picture.\n\nOverall, Siu lam juk kau is a amazing combination of comedy, action, romance, and dazzling soccer footage, forming an irresistible package to those looking for something they haven't seen before. We see that it is a personal story that everyone is having fun being a part of. That also helped this film   the characters really wanted to be in this film and it shined like the North Star through our screen. The dubbing (which seemed off a couple times) only added delight to this film. Chow's Siu lam juk kau, is and will always be breathtaking.\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77527,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"football","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shaolin Soccer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi550542873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiMjFiNzgtMjg3MS00NWU2LWJlZTItODQ0NDE5OGRlYTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiMjFiNzgtMjg3MS00NWU2LWJlZTItODQ0NDE5OGRlYTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955505/","name":"Wei Zhao","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939431/","name":"Yat-Fei Wong"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0302241/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032768/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874683/","name":"Kan-Cheung Tsang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298676/","name":"Min-Hun Fung"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":318968,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The mall is now closing forever.."","reviewBody":"How will mankind behave in the end times? Will we turn into raving lunatics and attack one another? Will we try to slavishly hold onto some fabric of our society? Will we kick back and accept what is happening?\n\n`Dawn of the Dead' in some ways tries to answer that question. The movie, a remake of George Romero's classic 1978 sequel to `Night of the Living Dead,' throws a group of people together while society crumbles around them and allows the viewer to watch as humans seek to survive an onslaught of the undead.\n\nThe movie opens with the unimaginable happening. Hordes of zombies have overtaken Milwaukee and numerous survivors are both fighting off the monsters and trying to escape the city. One such group includes Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse who is running scared after losing her husband, Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a tough-as-nails cop, Michael (Jake Weber), who tries to be two-steps ahead of any dangerous situation, and Andre (Mekhi Phifer), whose trying to care of his pregnant wife.\n\nSeeking shelter from the waves of zombie attacks, the group decides to head toward a local mall and hole up there until help arrives. Once inside they join with security guards and use the shopping center as a refuge from the undead while trying to piece together what's left of their lives.\n\nThe plot is pretty straightforward, and relies mostly on cliché themes to move the story along. So as a rule, most films such as this tend to be predictable and quite tepid. Luckily, `Dawn of the Dead' has strong personalities to fall back on, making it thankfully every bit a character-driven drama as it is a horror-action piece.\n\nAs Ana, Polley convincingly plays a waif turned survivor with just the right amount of emoting. She is strong and vulnerable at the same moment, trying to remain reasonable in unreasonable times. Weber also fits this bill as Michael, a man with a shady past full of regret who tries to fill others with hope while remaining a stark realistic.\n\nRhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. As Kenneth, he becomes the group's de facto leader and top man of action. He keeps the clearest head when trouble is afoot and leads the group out of one scrape after another. Rhames gives the character a silent strength that provides the film with a much needed human edge.\n\nFirst time director Zack Snyder moves the film along briskly and effectively, keeping the action scenes tight and the dramatic scenes quiet. There is no heavy-handed sermonizing here that tends to infiltrate most big-budget horror movies -- Snyder wisely lets the images speak for themselves.\n\nThe horror itself is shocking and grabs your attention, which is a plus considering most of the recent crop of thrillers. The fact that it is happening to sympathetic characters that we care about is another feather in the movie's cap.\n\nAll to often most horror movies are just excuses for numerous poorly developed characters to be killed in awful ways for the enjoyment of the audience. As far as recent zombie movies go, `Dawn of the Dead' thankfully remains closer to `28 Days Later' than `House of the Dead.'\n\nHowever, despite all the movie's strengths, it still pales in comparison to the original. Romero's `Dawn of the Dead' took the premise of people trapped in mall and used it to make some pointed social commentary about consumerism. The first '`Dawn' had human characters selfishly hoarding material goods for themselves, using the mall not only as a refuge from zombies but also as their own personal palace that provides them with more items than they could ever need.\n\nIt's to the detriment of the new film that it never takes the concept to this level. Here, the story seems to take place in a mall because it's a cool place for a horror movie, not because it can draw out anything interesting in the characters themselves. Also, in the original the zombies wanted inside not only to eat the humans but also because they are drawn to the shopping center since is was an important place to them when they were alive.\n\nIt's a shame that this time around viewers won't get the chance to see zombies wandering around JC Penney or stumbling up and down escalators, the joke being humans amble about aimlessly themselves like the undead at the mall.\n\n`Dawn of the Dead' is a very bloody and terrifying film but it lacks the superior gory effects from the 1978 movie. That should not stop the squeamish from twitching in their seats due to the horrific content onscreen.\n\nGood acting and smart thinking elevates the proceedings among most other horror offerings, but compared to Romero's original it lacks the observations necessary to make it a classic. The first film remains an intelligent critique on human actions during the apocalypse, while this is just a suspense drama that is dressed to kill.\n\n8 out of 10 stars. Not as good as Romero's original, but still one heck of a shot in the arm to cure the memory from most modern horror misfires.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":246662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror"],"datePublished":"2004-06-02","keywords":"survival horror,mall,nurse,shopping mall,zombie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Guide to the Films of Zack Snyder","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1692647449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","description":"From 'Dawn of the Dead' and '300' to 'Zack Snyder's Justice League' and 'Army of the Dead,' we break down the stunning visual trademarks of director Zack Snyder."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001631/","name":"Sarah Polley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001616/","name":"Mekhi Phifer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086710/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010962/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013658/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

The mall is now closing forever.."","reviewBody":"How will mankind behave in the end times? Will we turn into raving lunatics and attack one another? Will we try to slavishly hold onto some fabric of our society? Will we kick back and accept what is happening?\n\n`Dawn of the Dead' in some ways tries to answer that question. The movie, a remake of George Romero's classic 1978 sequel to `Night of the Living Dead,' throws a group of people together while society crumbles around them and allows the viewer to watch as humans seek to survive an onslaught of the undead.\n\nThe movie opens with the unimaginable happening. Hordes of zombies have overtaken Milwaukee and numerous survivors are both fighting off the monsters and trying to escape the city. One such group includes Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse who is running scared after losing her husband, Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a tough-as-nails cop, Michael (Jake Weber), who tries to be two-steps ahead of any dangerous situation, and Andre (Mekhi Phifer), whose trying to care of his pregnant wife.\n\nSeeking shelter from the waves of zombie attacks, the group decides to head toward a local mall and hole up there until help arrives. Once inside they join with security guards and use the shopping center as a refuge from the undead while trying to piece together what's left of their lives.\n\nThe plot is pretty straightforward, and relies mostly on cliché themes to move the story along. So as a rule, most films such as this tend to be predictable and quite tepid. Luckily, `Dawn of the Dead' has strong personalities to fall back on, making it thankfully every bit a character-driven drama as it is a horror-action piece.\n\nAs Ana, Polley convincingly plays a waif turned survivor with just the right amount of emoting. She is strong and vulnerable at the same moment, trying to remain reasonable in unreasonable times. Weber also fits this bill as Michael, a man with a shady past full of regret who tries to fill others with hope while remaining a stark realistic.\n\nRhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. As Kenneth, he becomes the group's de facto leader and top man of action. He keeps the clearest head when trouble is afoot and leads the group out of one scrape after another. Rhames gives the character a silent strength that provides the film with a much needed human edge.\n\nFirst time director Zack Snyder moves the film along briskly and effectively, keeping the action scenes tight and the dramatic scenes quiet. There is no heavy-handed sermonizing here that tends to infiltrate most big-budget horror movies -- Snyder wisely lets the images speak for themselves.\n\nThe horror itself is shocking and grabs your attention, which is a plus considering most of the recent crop of thrillers. The fact that it is happening to sympathetic characters that we care about is another feather in the movie's cap.\n\nAll to often most horror movies are just excuses for numerous poorly developed characters to be killed in awful ways for the enjoyment of the audience. As far as recent zombie movies go, `Dawn of the Dead' thankfully remains closer to `28 Days Later' than `House of the Dead.'\n\nHowever, despite all the movie's strengths, it still pales in comparison to the original. Romero's `Dawn of the Dead' took the premise of people trapped in mall and used it to make some pointed social commentary about consumerism. The first '`Dawn' had human characters selfishly hoarding material goods for themselves, using the mall not only as a refuge from zombies but also as their own personal palace that provides them with more items than they could ever need.\n\nIt's to the detriment of the new film that it never takes the concept to this level. Here, the story seems to take place in a mall because it's a cool place for a horror movie, not because it can draw out anything interesting in the characters themselves. Also, in the original the zombies wanted inside not only to eat the humans but also because they are drawn to the shopping center since is was an important place to them when they were alive.\n\nIt's a shame that this time around viewers won't get the chance to see zombies wandering around JC Penney or stumbling up and down escalators, the joke being humans amble about aimlessly themselves like the undead at the mall.\n\n`Dawn of the Dead' is a very bloody and terrifying film but it lacks the superior gory effects from the 1978 movie. That should not stop the squeamish from twitching in their seats due to the horrific content onscreen.\n\nGood acting and smart thinking elevates the proceedings among most other horror offerings, but compared to Romero's original it lacks the observations necessary to make it a classic. The first film remains an intelligent critique on human actions during the apocalypse, while this is just a suspense drama that is dressed to kill.\n\n8 out of 10 stars. Not as good as Romero's original, but still one heck of a shot in the arm to cure the memory from most modern horror misfires.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":246662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror"],"datePublished":"2004-06-02","keywords":"survival horror,mall,nurse,shopping mall,zombie","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Guide to the Films of Zack Snyder","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1692647449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ1OWE3YmItMWUyYy00MzliLWFhZWMtNmJhOWMyYWNhOWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hZGV0aXNj._V1_.jpg","description":"From 'Dawn of the Dead' and '300' to 'Zack Snyder's Justice League' and 'Army of the Dead,' we break down the stunning visual trademarks of director Zack Snyder.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001631/","name":"Sarah Polley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000609/","name":"Ving Rhames","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001616/","name":"Mekhi Phifer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086710/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010962/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013658/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

Instead, wait and see what the new show is about and give it a chance. Unless of course, you want to miss one of the best dramas currently airing...\n\nBSG is a very human story. Yet unlike Star Trek, they're not resolved by the end of the episode. Here the characters are real people who make mistakes, grow and learn from their errors. Or maybe they don't... \n\nThe point is that in the new BSG, the impact of the loss of the Colonies is something everybody must deal with, be it on a resource-management level to dealing with the loss of their families. The impact of the Cylon attack - never explored in the original series - is a major emphasis in the show and the viewer genuinely does get the feeling of the "rag tag fleet."\n\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed the original series as much as anybody, but it was a product of its time and audience-slot. The new BSG is a much more adult production, both in terms of the writing and performances and the intended audience.\n\nAdditionally, the show is very non-sci-fi, but in a good way. Whenever any "science" turns up, it's integrated in such a way as to have minimal impact on the plot and, unlike Star Trek, it isn't used as a Deus Ex Machina to simply resolve the "crisis of the week." In fact, I'd go as far as to say the show is closer to 24 or The West Wing than it is Star Trek or Babylon 5, with the focus being much more on the people and their individual actions, rather than a wide-scale "space opera."\n\nPerformances are all strong, with James Callis being the real star. His tortured performance as the guilt-stricken Baltar are a joy to watch as he flips from near-hysterical lunatic to scheming toad to smooth womaniser. Olmos has the presence to give Adama the air of authority required. Sackhoff's performance as Starbuck is "subtly obvious" - she plays the brash, cocky pilot a little too well, something that's explained in later episodes. And Bamber's Apollo is a mix of heroic action and self-doubt which balances well. Mention must also go to McDonnell's President Roslin who, over the course of the series, has grown in stature and presence in a very subtle manner.\n\nQuite simply, Battlestar Galactica is one of the most consistently strong shows I've ever seen. Considering this is only the first of (hopefully) many seasons, it's amazing to see how the show has "hit the ground running," with each episode being an improvement on the last. And considering the high standard of the first one, that's quite the achievement.\n\nWatch it. You won't be disappointed."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-01-14","keywords":"human in outer space,nuclear weapon,totalitarianism,prophecy,space opera","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001579/","name":"Edward James Olmos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001521/","name":"Mary McDonnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0051397/","name":"Jamie Bamber"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103727/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176813/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129175/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488991/","name":"Glen A.

Olmos has the presence to give Adama the air of authority required. Sackhoff's performance as Starbuck is "subtly obvious" - she plays the brash, cocky pilot a little too well, something that's explained in later episodes. And Bamber's Apollo is a mix of heroic action and self-doubt which balances well.

Considering this is only the first of (hopefully) many seasons, it's amazing to see how the show has "hit the ground running," with each episode being an improvement on the last. And considering the high standard of the first one, that's quite the achievement.\n\nWatch it.

The characters either make or break a show like this, and in this case, the actors and their characters bring the entire story up. For example, the kid math-savant, a tough female DOD agent, Henry the quasi-mechanic, the tough deputy Lupo and an all-American US Marshall, who is the normal guy and now the Sheriff of Eureka. There are others of course and I am hoping the show hangs on long enough to develop a following. The setting is perfect. The writer's foreshadowing worked like a charm. Many things I assume will be happening. As I was watching, I kept saying, where's the villain?? And at the end of the first episode, a sweet villain was revealed, and in such a way -- you had to go --- Whoa -- very nice. The actor playing Jack Carter was perfectly chosen to act as us in this strange little story. Briefly, a small town hosts the world's most shining minds as they experiment and tinker with science and it's up to the normal people to keep the brains on the right path. I am so looking forward to the next installment. My hats off to the creative team -- this is just what I needed. Let's all hope we don't lose this show in the most important early stages. Ratings are King and just because it's good doesn't mean it will last. So fan boys gravitate to this show on Tuesdays on the best channel on the planet -- sci-fi!!\n\nAddition: Just saw the sixth episode. This is a show that keeps topping itself, introducing new and deeper sub-plots and literally has a dream cast. You will fall in love with Eureka.\n\nHere we are at the third season and it has only gotten better and better. This season everything's been kicked up a notch, I cannot believe the storyline of Nathan. I stand in awe of the writers, and as always one of the best TV casts in history.\n\nFourth Season opener: While most shows hit a slump in their 4th outing, Eureka raises the bar. The time-traveling theme reveals just how inspiring the creators, actors, crew and writers can be. I am so impressed. You will be too.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50720,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-07-18","keywords":"scientist,problem solving,pacific northwest,small town,alternate reality","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272399/","name":"Colin Ferguson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0724757/","name":"Salli Richardson-Whitfield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1569714/","name":"Erica Cerra"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129175/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242101/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1184676/","name":"Andrew Cosby"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1958727/","name":"Jaime Paglia"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eureka: The Complete Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3793855769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU1OTgwN2UtMWNjMS00NjNiLTkyNzgtYmFjZGUyNjc5OTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU1OTgwN2UtMWNjMS00NjNiLTkyNzgtYmFjZGUyNjc5OTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Eureka: The Complete Series"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even though Leigh Whannel (spelling might be wrong) Doesn't act that well, you can see his fear, along with everyone else's. Not the most gruesome of the series. The twist at the end is one you didn't know to begin with but then you're like "omg totally makes sense now". This series is a fun one to watch, all the blood and gore. It is a classic among horror films. Definitely a necessity for horror enthusiasts to watch!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399420,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-05-18","keywords":"surprise ending,locked in a room,trapped in a room,mind game,flashback","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi8957721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1MDc0NzE3NDBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDk2NTEyODIx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1MDc0NzE3NDBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDk2NTEyODIx._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the 10th Anniversary trailer for Saw.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000144/","name":"Cary Elwes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1191481/","name":"Leigh Whannell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000418/","name":"Danny Glover"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021715/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0115136/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0137447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1191481/","name":"Leigh Whannell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
