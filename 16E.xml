Skip &amp; Harry are from the East and are sent to a prison in the Western part of the country and they have to face some very difficult situations in the prison and just can't seem to adjust to prison life.

I especially like the down-to-earth, realistic beauty that Gwyneth Paltrow always brings to a role; she never seems like a movie star playing a real person.

    <desc lang="hr">Once Upon a Time in Mexico: Directed by Robert Rodriguez. With Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Johnny Depp, Mickey Rourke. Hitman "El Mariachi" becomes involved in international espionage involving a psychotic CIA agent and a corrupt Mexican general." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0285823/","name":"Once Upon a Time in Mexico","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MDg5OTcwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI1MTIzMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Hitman "El Mariachi" becomes involved in international espionage involving a psychotic CIA agent and a corrupt Mexican general.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0285823/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"bob the moo"},"dateCreated":"2003-09-30","inLanguage":"English","name":"Sporadically enjoyable but the plot is a total shambles","reviewBody":"El Mariachi has long quit the gunslinger trade but is offered a chance to avenge the death of his wife and daughter by slightly unhinged CIA agent Sands.  Sands is trying to control a coup by allowing it to happy but then having the victor killed as soon as he takes power.  However the involvement of drug lord Barillo and various other groups soon complicate matters causing bullets to come from all sides.\n\nAfter taking an unlikely trilogy to box office success, Rodriguez returns to the film series that basically brought him the success he has today  El Mariachi.  While the first film in the series was a very cheap movie, the second and the third swelled with budget and star names.  Here the action is constant and is very stylised.  This is not to say that it is all edge of the seat stuff, but if spectacle and bangs is all you are after then this should do the job nicely.  None of it moves slowly simply because it has more than enough going on to fill the time  but that's the problem to be honest.\n\nThe plot has so much going on but none of it actually fits together or makes a whole lot of sense.  After a while any attempt to put things together in my head became a wasted effort  clearly the point here was that the style and gloss was meant to be everything.  The other downside to this is that some characters are so poorly used that it's a wonder as to why they were even written in.  Some cameos are fantastic and make the film.  I refer to, of course, Depp, who, for the second time this summer, manages to make a film better by his sheer witty performance.  He owes a lot to the writing of the character but he carries him off superbly and is darkly funny.  However Rouke, Blades, Mendes, Dafoe all have little to do and, with some of them, are just clutter.

Sands is trying to control a coup by allowing it to happy but then having the victor killed as soon as he takes power.  However the involvement of drug lord Barillo and various other groups soon complicate matters causing bullets to come from all sides.\n\nAfter taking an unlikely trilogy to box office success, Rodriguez returns to the film series that basically brought him the success he has today  El Mariachi.  While the first film in the series was a very cheap movie, the second and the third swelled with budget and star names.  Here the action is constant and is very stylised.  This is not to say that it is all edge of the seat stuff, but if spectacle and bangs is all you are after then this should do the job nicely.  None of it moves slowly simply because it has more than enough going on to fill the time  but that's the problem to be honest.\n\nThe plot has so much going on but none of it actually fits together or makes a whole lot of sense.  After a while any attempt to put things together in my head became a wasted effort  clearly the point here was that the style and gloss was meant to be everything.  The other downside to this is that some characters are so poorly used that it's a wonder as to why they were even written in.  Some cameos are fantastic and make the film.  I refer to, of course, Depp, who, for the second time this summer, manages to make a film better by his sheer witty performance.  He owes a lot to the writing of the character but he carries him off superbly and is darkly funny.  However Rouke, Blades, Mendes, Dafoe all have little to do and, with some of them, are just clutter.  Banderas does his usual stuff with style but his character doesn't have the depth that the flashbacks I think are meant to give him  again this is style over substance.\n\nI still quite enjoyed the film but couldn't help but feel it was less the sum of it's parts.  With a budget, big names and lots of action I was surprised that the cluttered, shambolic plot managed to take away from the `fun' as much as it did  but it did.

But if you can handle some bloodshed, no, make that a substantial amount of bloodshed - but perhaps I should add in a comic environment - there's some pretty funny stuff here. Woody Harreleson and Jesse Eisenberg make an amusing odd couple and Emma Stone was fine for this material, although she and Abigale Breslin had slightly less to do. \n\nI'm certainly no expert on the horror genre or the zombie sub-genre, but I can say that this wasn't as scary as Shaun of the Dead, in fact not very scary at all, I may have jumped back just a tiny bit a few times; however I may have laughed more. However I'm sure it does make a difference that I saw 'Shaun' alone on DVD, while 'Zombieland' I watched in a theater full of people laughing, clapping and cheering. \n\nLet's face it, you know what's going to happen in this flick, but I'm happy to say, plot conventions and all, this delivers enough laughs so if you know what you're getting into I doubt you'll regret laying down the price of admission for this sucker. Should you see it, see it opening night - if I haven't made it clear enough already, this is the kind of movie where the more enthusiastic people in the theater, the more fun it will be.

There was something about him that I felt sympathetic towards on one hand and gave me the creeps on the other. Sympathetic because in more than one ways he is like you and me. He wants to be rich, he wants approval and he is may be just an opportunist. Creepy because he latches on like a leech, he can't take rejection and though he doesn't plan but once he assumes the identity of someone else he can go to any extent to keep that. Actually one can identify with the character so much that it's almost scary to look inside your dark corners.\n\nMatt Damon played this three-dimensional character so well that I almost became a huge fan of his. Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf, whose identity Tom Ripley steals was very good as well. The movie is shot in Italy, moves at a leisurely speed and is very atmospheric. One of my all time favorite thrillers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":196387,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1999-12-25","keywords":"nudity,italy,sociopath,male frontal nudity,neo noir","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Cate Blanchett Almost Played Clarice Starling?","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2861284889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGUxOGZjNTYtYTM5NC00N2M2LTk5YmUtNDJkMGViZTUwNGEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGUxOGZjNTYtYTM5NC00N2M2LTk5YmUtNDJkMGViZTUwNGEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Cate Blanchett has two Oscars and a resume of both big blockbusters and art house hits, but she's missed out on some roles along the way."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000569/","name":"Gwyneth Paltrow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005237/","name":"Anthony Minghella"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038270/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383604/","name":"Patricia Highsmith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005237/","name":"Anthony Minghella"}],"duration":"PT2H19M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There was something about him that I felt sympathetic towards on one hand and gave me the creeps on the other. Sympathetic because in more than one ways he is like you and me. He wants to be rich, he wants approval and he is may be just an opportunist. Creepy because he latches on like a leech, he can't take rejection and though he doesn't plan but once he assumes the identity of someone else he can go to any extent to keep that. Actually one can identify with the character so much that it's almost scary to look inside your dark corners.\n\nMatt Damon played this three-dimensional character so well that I almost became a huge fan of his. Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf, whose identity Tom Ripley steals was very good as well. The movie is shot in Italy, moves at a leisurely speed and is very atmospheric. One of my all time favorite thrillers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":196387,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1999-12-25","keywords":"nudity,italy,sociopath,male frontal nudity,neo noir","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Cate Blanchett Almost Played Clarice Starling?","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2861284889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGUxOGZjNTYtYTM5NC00N2M2LTk5YmUtNDJkMGViZTUwNGEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGUxOGZjNTYtYTM5NC00N2M2LTk5YmUtNDJkMGViZTUwNGEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Cate Blanchett has two Oscars and a resume of both big blockbusters and art house hits, but she's missed out on some roles along the way.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000569/","name":"Gwyneth Paltrow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005237/","name":"Anthony Minghella"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038270/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383604/","name":"Patricia Highsmith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005237/","name":"Anthony Minghella"],"duration":"PT2H19M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="hr">Profileri</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Francuska serija pod nazivom "Profileri" predstavlja Chloé, kriminalističku psihologinju koja istražuje ubojice kako bi pomogla riješiti slučajeve zločina. Chloé Saint-Laurent je profiler i radi s policijskim timom za rješavanje ubojstva u Parizu. Ona je vrlo draga, nosi jako obojenu odjeću i veliku žutu torbu. Izgleda poput djevojčice koja treba lutku, ali je vrlo pametna i jako dobar profiler. Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

Nakon što je Nolan uspio uvjeriti jednu ženu da ne počini samoubojstvo, Jackson se nađe na udaru kritike jer nije koristio vatreno oružje kada se činilo da je morao, no Lopez ga štiti. Nolan i Bishop uhite ovisnicu zbog posjedovanja droge, ali doznaju da je nožem u svađi ubila tinejdžericu, koja je preminula. Chen je zaglavila s novom osobom za obuku, dok se Tim opravlja i zafrkava uhićenog zbog krađe. Nolan i dalje ima problem jer balansira između onoga što osjeća kao civil i kako bi se trebao ponašati kao policajac.</desc>

The movie progresses through Wilberforce's life from about the time he begins his crusade against the slave trade in Parliament in his early 20's to the time it is eventually abolished. Everything in between is composed of all the hardships, victories, and relationships he goes through in the meantime. At some points the story can be a bit yawn inducing, but the film consistently seems to add just the right amount of humor or political intrigue to keep it afloat (more on the pacing below). There is a love interest Barbara, played by the quite attractive and dynamic Romola Garai, who keeps Mr. Fantastic...err...Wilberforce on track and encouraged. You get the feeling he would've never made it through the hard times without her (which is probably the case for most successful men as they say). The film does delve into evils of the slave trade, but it doesn't focus specifically on it, much like Amistad did focus on it. It seems to keep the main goal in mind, abolishing that heinous evil. This gives the film a "glass half full" feeling instead of a "glass half empty" one. You find yourself cheering for the good guys instead of seeking the heads of the bad ones.\n\nYou may be thinking they should've just called this film "Amistad: The Prequel", but that would do it a great disservice. Where Amistad succeeded in many ways such as exposing the horror of the slave trade in much more visual and visceral detail and containing great acting by Djimon Hounsou and Anthony Hopkins, I feel you ultimately left the theater not really feeling much better about anything. In fact, I'd say you may have left if feeling worse, maybe even shameful and/or guilty. Amazing Grace doesn't feel like that. In fact, it's not even really a "feel good" movie; it transcends that status. It's really a "do good" movie. You almost feel personal empowerment from the story, like you want to go out and change some social injustice yourself! Sure, we don't all have the political clout of a William Wilberforce, but we do have a voice. And I think that's why Amazing Grace stands above previous "social injustice" films like it. It feels organic instead of static. It feels like it could apply to today instead of some time long forgotten. It also appeals to everyone; black, white, or whoever. One African-American in the audience mentioned how he was impressed and encouraged at how passionate these white men were for the plight of the slaves. You also realize that slavery wasn't just an American problem, it was a world problem; which further emphasized the fact that the social injustice we see today isn't just a "fill_in_the_blank" problem, it's a world problem.\n\nI'm not knowledgeable enough to comment very much on the technical aspects of this film, but don't let the religious overtones fool you into thinking this is another technical mess like so many in the past. It is on par with any period film of its kind from Hollywood in almost every way; acting, set design, costume design, story, etc. \n\nOne thing I found a drawback to it was its pacing though. It starts off fairly tepid, and though it builds up, it seems to go through a cycle of building up and then falling back down again. This could ultimately be a good thing though, because if you can keep your focus throughout the film, you'll be in for a very powerful ending that evokes positive emotions you didn't think you had, and I think the cyclic nature of the film's progress enhances the fulfillment the ending provides. I also found the time period jumping around within the film to be a bit confusing at some points; like some scenes I didn't know if they were in the past or present. \n\nThe representative at the screening said the movie would be playing on about 850 screens nationwide on its opening weekend (Feb. 23). Though this is small compared to most major movies, it is a pretty good amount for a smaller movie like this. I recommend going to see it if you're interested in a movie with depth, passion, character, goodness, virtue, and victory. Does it entertain? Sure. But it seems to do a little more also. You can't say that about too many movies these days. You won't leave wishing you had that $8.50 back. \n\nIn case you're wondering about the title, John Newton, the composer of the famous hymn 'Amazing Grace', (played powerfully by Albert Finney), was a contemporary and friend of William Wilberforce. John Newton was also a reformed ex-slave trader.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24466,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2007-02-23","keywords":"pregnancy,christian feminism,slave,slave trade,abolition","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Amazing Grace","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi330694937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzhmYjhjY2QtMTYxYS00MjdlLThhOGYtMGRjNWRiYjlkNzI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzhmYjhjY2QtMTYxYS00MjdlLThhOGYtMGRjNWRiYjlkNzI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0344435/","name":"Ioan Gruffudd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002091/","name":"Michael Gambon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000776/","name":"Michael Apted"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129170/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136728/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041459/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140275/","name":"Steven Knight"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie progresses through Wilberforce's life from about the time he begins his crusade against the slave trade in Parliament in his early 20's to the time it is eventually abolished. Everything in between is composed of all the hardships, victories, and relationships he goes through in the meantime. At some points the story can be a bit yawn inducing, but the film consistently seems to add just the right amount of humor or political intrigue to keep it afloat (more on the pacing below). There is a love interest Barbara, played by the quite attractive and dynamic Romola Garai, who keeps Mr. Fantastic...err...Wilberforce on track and encouraged. You get the feeling he would've never made it through the hard times without her (which is probably the case for most successful men as they say). The film does delve into evils of the slave trade, but it doesn't focus specifically on it, much like Amistad did focus on it. It seems to keep the main goal in mind, abolishing that heinous evil. This gives the film a "glass half full" feeling instead of a "glass half empty" one. You find yourself cheering for the good guys instead of seeking the heads of the bad ones.\n\nYou may be thinking they should've just called this film "Amistad: The Prequel", but that would do it a great disservice. Where Amistad succeeded in many ways such as exposing the horror of the slave trade in much more visual and visceral detail and containing great acting by Djimon Hounsou and Anthony Hopkins, I feel you ultimately left the theater not really feeling much better about anything. In fact, I'd say you may have left if feeling worse, maybe even shameful and/or guilty. Amazing Grace doesn't feel like that. In fact, it's not even really a "feel good" movie; it transcends that status. It's really a "do good" movie. You almost feel personal empowerment from the story, like you want to go out and change some social injustice yourself! Sure, we don't all have the political clout of a William Wilberforce, but we do have a voice. And I think that's why Amazing Grace stands above previous "social injustice" films like it. It feels organic instead of static. It feels like it could apply to today instead of some time long forgotten. It also appeals to everyone; black, white, or whoever. One African-American in the audience mentioned how he was impressed and encouraged at how passionate these white men were for the plight of the slaves. You also realize that slavery wasn't just an American problem, it was a world problem; which further emphasized the fact that the social injustice we see today isn't just a "fill_in_the_blank" problem, it's a world problem.\n\nI'm not knowledgeable enough to comment very much on the technical aspects of this film, but don't let the religious overtones fool you into thinking this is another technical mess like so many in the past. It is on par with any period film of its kind from Hollywood in almost every way; acting, set design, costume design, story, etc. \n\nOne thing I found a drawback to it was its pacing though. It starts off fairly tepid, and though it builds up, it seems to go through a cycle of building up and then falling back down again. This could ultimately be a good thing though, because if you can keep your focus throughout the film, you'll be in for a very powerful ending that evokes positive emotions you didn't think you had, and I think the cyclic nature of the film's progress enhances the fulfillment the ending provides. I also found the time period jumping around within the film to be a bit confusing at some points; like some scenes I didn't know if they were in the past or present. \n\nThe representative at the screening said the movie would be playing on about 850 screens nationwide on its opening weekend (Feb. 23). Though this is small compared to most major movies, it is a pretty good amount for a smaller movie like this. I recommend going to see it if you're interested in a movie with depth, passion, character, goodness, virtue, and victory. Does it entertain? Sure. But it seems to do a little more also. You can't say that about too many movies these days. You won't leave wishing you had that $8.50 back. \n\nIn case you're wondering about the title, John Newton, the composer of the famous hymn 'Amazing Grace', (played powerfully by Albert Finney), was a contemporary and friend of William Wilberforce. John Newton was also a reformed ex-slave trader.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24466,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2007-02-23","keywords":"pregnancy,christian feminism,slave,slave trade,abolition","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Amazing Grace","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi330694937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzhmYjhjY2QtMTYxYS00MjdlLThhOGYtMGRjNWRiYjlkNzI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzhmYjhjY2QtMTYxYS00MjdlLThhOGYtMGRjNWRiYjlkNzI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0344435/","name":"Ioan Gruffudd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002091/","name":"Michael Gambon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000776/","name":"Michael Apted"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129170/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136728/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041459/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140275/","name":"Steven Knight"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie progresses through Wilberforce's life from about the time he begins his crusade against the slave trade in Parliament in his early 20's to the time it is eventually abolished. Everything in between is composed of all the hardships, victories, and relationships he goes through in the meantime. At some points the story can be a bit yawn inducing, but the film consistently seems to add just the right amount of humor or political intrigue to keep it afloat (more on the pacing below). There is a love interest Barbara, played by the quite attractive and dynamic Romola Garai, who keeps Mr. Fantastic...err...Wilberforce on track and encouraged. You get the feeling he would've never made it through the hard times without her (which is probably the case for most successful men as they say). The film does delve into evils of the slave trade, but it doesn't focus specifically on it, much like Amistad did focus on it. It seems to keep the main goal in mind, abolishing that heinous evil. This gives the film a "glass half full" feeling instead of a "glass half empty" one. You find yourself cheering for the good guys instead of seeking the heads of the bad ones.\n\nYou may be thinking they should've just called this film "Amistad: The Prequel", but that would do it a great disservice.

The movie provided several opportunities for soda to squirt out your nose! The music was really good, but esp the Meat Ball song coordinated with the dance scene.

I guess we all want varying things from the dramas we watch - so long as the stories are character driven and allow for personal growth, and the main characters are likeable, I don't mind spending time with one or two people I would avoid in real life. Some of Callie and Mariana's new loft mates are a bit abrasive, and their workmates are ****s, but without conflict there would be no story. At the beginning of the pilot episode Callie and Mariana are in the same outfits and UHaul they were in at the very end of The Fosters.\n\nCierra Ramirez is exceptionally talented, has great comic timing (a gift), and never murdered a line in 5 seasons of The Fosters. She's the perfect person to play Mariana - set up by the writers with a propensity to stretch the truth or delude herself, and with no respect for anyone's secrets but her own. These flaws often are what keeps the stories moving. She makes up for these unforgivable traits by being fierce, whether protecting someone she cares about or cutting through other people's BS. Her breakthrough moments and her sense of fun are highlights, for me.\n\nNo, Callie has never seemed promiscuous or needy to me, but then I've never understood why anyone would expect most people to become attached, engaged and married happily ever after to only one person in a lifetime (unless the story is set in the 16th century or something). I'm in my 60s and happy for these characters to act their age - gosh, I might even learn something when one of them makes a mistake.\n\nThe pace of the storyline seems less frantic than The Fosters.\n\nAnother thing I don't understand is reviewers who whinge and moan about the show's "liberal" values. Well, duh! If they find it all so unbearable why on earth don't they watch something else? It's like smacking yourself in the eye so you can resent having hands.\n\nThe setting and sets for this series are just yummy, and the art theme is a bonus.

I guess we all want varying things from the dramas we watch - so long as the stories are character driven and allow for personal growth, and the main characters are likeable, I don't mind spending time with one or two people I would avoid in real life. Some of Callie and Mariana's new loft mates are a bit abrasive, and their workmates are ****s, but without conflict there would be no story. At the beginning of the pilot episode Callie and Mariana are in the same outfits and UHaul they were in at the very end of The Fosters.\n\nCierra Ramirez is exceptionally talented, has great comic timing (a gift), and never murdered a line in 5 seasons of The Fosters. She's the perfect person to play Mariana - set up by the writers with a propensity to stretch the truth or delude herself, and with no respect for anyone's secrets but her own. These flaws often are what keeps the stories moving. She makes up for these unforgivable traits by being fierce, whether protecting someone she cares about or cutting through other people's BS. Her breakthrough moments and her sense of fun are highlights, for me.\n\nNo, Callie has never seemed promiscuous or needy to me, but then I've never understood why anyone would expect most people to become attached, engaged and married happily ever after to only one person in a lifetime (unless the story is set in the 16th century or something). I'm in my 60s and happy for these characters to act their age - gosh, I might even learn something when one of them makes a mistake.\n\nThe pace of the storyline seems less frantic than The Fosters.\n\nAnother thing I don't understand is reviewers who whinge and moan about the show's "liberal" values. Well, duh! If they find it all so unbearable why on earth don't they watch something else? It's like smacking yourself in the eye so you can resent having hands.\n\nThe setting and sets for this series are just yummy, and the art theme is a bonus. The sequence in 01x05 involving the 1957 photo from Arkansas (see... no spoiler!) is typical of the occasional treats I've come to expect from these prducers. My only wish is that, as we are getting a lot of flashback sequences, writers would find a way to make this slightly less confusing. As on The Fosters, I sometimes find myself wondering, not where, but when we are, in a story.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5323,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-01-08","keywords":"live","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2314596/","name":"Maia Mitchell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2028116/","name":"Cierra Ramirez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5264136/","name":"Zuri Adele"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0287645/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021149/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1401678/","name":"Bradley Bredeweg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425394/","name":"Joanna Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656739/","name":"Peter Paige"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 1 Promo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi153598489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzN2MzYjAtMWIxNy00MjViLWIzZmItNzMyOWUwZWM3NjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzN2MzYjAtMWIxNy00MjViLWIzZmItNzMyOWUwZWM3NjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Callie and Mariana Foster move to Los Angeles and begin their lives as young adults.

The beautiful face of the American nature and the indifferent face of the American society.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"genre":["Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-06","keywords":"one word title,forename as title,female protagonist,title appears in writing,emigrant","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3756910/","name":"Patrycja Planik"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3161822/","name":"Andreas Horvath"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0757097/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010329/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0326911/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3161822/","name":"Andreas Horvath"],"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm sure George Clooney must have these as well as he used the actual footage extensively in his fine drama "Good Night and Good Luck". As a previous poster said, by concentrating on what was actually presented, Clooney is able to focus on the ethical issues that were the real substance of the broadcasts, rather than the tragicomic personalities involved. He wants us to see that the same issues are in our lives today, (Clooney has had his own battles with would-be modern McCarthys like Bill O'Reilly), but he isn't going to force the issue. He's doing exactly what Murrow and Friendly did with the McCarthy broadcast: using the actual record to tell the story.\n\nThere are minor, but significant embellishments, mostly an impressive cast of actors who can tell us more with one look than an entire speech. Leading the way is David Straithairn as Murrow. Except for possessing a higher pitched voice than the original, he's got his man down cold. I would pick Frank Langella as William Paley, here presented as a man with ideals but who is rooted in the realities of business, the sort of guy who has to make the tough decisions the idealists like Murrow don't have to or want to deal with. Then there is Ray Wise as the vulnerable Don Hollenbeck, who was one of the co-creators of "You Are There", a program this film somewhat resembles. He wound up being "there" when he didn't really want to be.\n\nWhat really enhances the show is the black and white photography, (actually, according to the notes, it was "The film was shot on color film on a grayscale set, then color-corrected in post"  whatever that means). Not only does it heighten the drama, (magazine photographers, in the days when they had a choice, said "black and white for drama, color for excitement"), but the tremendous resolution seems to bring out each furrow and poor on each person's face, allowing the viewer to see into their souls.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95961,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2005-11-04","keywords":"reporter,journalist,1950s,radio,politician","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Good Night, and Good Luck","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2963931417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Independent Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000657/","name":"David Strathairn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0165101/","name":"Patricia Clarkson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106448/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005596/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381416/","name":"Grant Heslov"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Elegy is a film that could easily have been written with him in mind, though by the time it's over, Penelope Cruz has stolen away with it, and changed Kingsley's character in the progression. It's properly made.\n\nKingsley seems to be just about the entire movie as a self-seeking book critic. He was married in the past, and has a well-to-do son. He got divorced years ago and has a sex pal relationship with another woman who he sees rarely, played by Patricia Clarkson, who I can totally see having the capability for no-strings occasional liaisons. He is frequently attracted to his female students, and sometimes has sex with some of them. Still, to steer clear of trouble, he always waits until they graduate. With one of these women, Penelope Cruz's character, a more profound relationship grows.\n\nBut Kingsley has never matured in this manner. He is preoccupied with jealousy, certain that she is seeing someone else, someone younger, more handsome and virile. He even shows up at a dance he knows she's attending, to check up on her. His doubt frustrates and deters her, because she cannot put up with not being trusted.\n\nWhen the time comes, the movie makes a dramatic bend which surrounds all the deepest bona fide feelings of the story. And in these scenes, Cruz is peacefully compelling and dreadfully real. You come to appreciate why the director, Isabel Coixet, cast Cruz rather than a younger, authentically college-age actress. An actress necessitates wisdom and the familiarity of time to play these scenes, and Cruz must have both, especially now that I'm seeing her shortly after her incredible performance in Vicky Cristina Barcelona.\n\nThat this nuanced drama with erudite cultural ambiance is not merely a self-indulgent male writer's wet dream about the horny scoundrel and the exquisite and charming Venus is a relief. That it sees Manhattan plainly as a location benefits this story because it is a place where we suppose things like this are liable to take place, not like the typical burgh where we live. Then there is Dennis Hopper as the old comrade with whom Kingsley has coffee and plays racquetball, who tries to bring wisdom to Kingsley's activities, but sees no light at the end of the tunnel. And Peter Sarsgaard as Kingsley's son, with problems of his own, and a father who has become not only a shame but an unrelated matter. But what the movie's not afraid to do is let you in on Kingsley's feelings after awhile. Who cares about all these things he should accept as responsibility when he's so immersed in love for this new, young person?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22299,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-04-18","keywords":"older man younger woman relationship,teacher,sex,sexual attraction,breasts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Elegy: Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi753598745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNTIzMTExNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIxOTc3MQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNTIzMTExNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIxOTc3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for Elegy, directed by Isabel Coixet."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001426/","name":"Ben Kingsley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004851/","name":"Penélope Cruz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0165101/","name":"Patricia Clarkson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170043/","name":"Isabel Coixet"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0583292/","name":"Nicholas Meyer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744980/","name":"Philip Roth"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Then there is Dennis Hopper as the old comrade with whom Kingsley has coffee and plays racquetball, who tries to bring wisdom to Kingsley's activities, but sees no light at the end of the tunnel. And Peter Sarsgaard as Kingsley's son, with problems of his own, and a father who has become not only a shame but an unrelated matter. But what the movie's not afraid to do is let you in on Kingsley's feelings after awhile. Who cares about all these things he should accept as responsibility when he's so immersed in love for this new, young person?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22299,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-04-18","keywords":"older man younger woman relationship,teacher,sex,sexual attraction,breasts","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Elegy: Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi753598745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNTIzMTExNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIxOTc3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNTIzMTExNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIxOTc3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for Elegy, directed by Isabel Coixet.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001426/","name":"Ben Kingsley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004851/","name":"Penélope Cruz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0165101/","name":"Patricia Clarkson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170043/","name":"Isabel Coixet"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0583292/","name":"Nicholas Meyer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744980/","name":"Philip Roth"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm sure George Clooney must have these as well as he used the actual footage extensively in his fine drama "Good Night and Good Luck". As a previous poster said, by concentrating on what was actually presented, Clooney is able to focus on the ethical issues that were the real substance of the broadcasts, rather than the tragicomic personalities involved. He wants us to see that the same issues are in our lives today, (Clooney has had his own battles with would-be modern McCarthys like Bill O'Reilly), but he isn't going to force the issue. He's doing exactly what Murrow and Friendly did with the McCarthy broadcast: using the actual record to tell the story.\n\nThere are minor, but significant embellishments, mostly an impressive cast of actors who can tell us more with one look than an entire speech. Leading the way is David Straithairn as Murrow. Except for possessing a higher pitched voice than the original, he's got his man down cold. I would pick Frank Langella as William Paley, here presented as a man with ideals but who is rooted in the realities of business, the sort of guy who has to make the tough decisions the idealists like Murrow don't have to or want to deal with. Then there is Ray Wise as the vulnerable Don Hollenbeck, who was one of the co-creators of "You Are There", a program this film somewhat resembles. He wound up being "there" when he didn't really want to be.\n\nWhat really enhances the show is the black and white photography, (actually, according to the notes, it was "The film was shot on color film on a grayscale set, then color-corrected in post"  whatever that means). Not only does it heighten the drama, (magazine photographers, in the days when they had a choice, said "black and white for drama, color for excitement"), but the tremendous resolution seems to bring out each furrow and poor on each person's face, allowing the viewer to see into their souls.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95961,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2005-11-04","keywords":"reporter,journalist,1950s,radio,politician","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Good Night, and Good Luck","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2963931417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Independent Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000657/","name":"David Strathairn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0165101/","name":"Patricia Clarkson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106448/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005596/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381416/","name":"Grant Heslov"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

World War II. Baseball. Spies. A true story. Assemble all those pieces and you have Morris "Moe" Berg. Director Ben Lewin (THE SESSIONS, 2012) brings the fascinating story to the big screen with Robert Rodat's (Oscar nominated for SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) screenplay adapted from the 1994 biography "The Catcher was a Spy: The Mysterious Life of Moe Berg" written by Nicholas Dawidoff. This is neither your typical spy movie nor your typical baseball movie. \n\nBackground information is provided by pre-movie title cards: in 1938 German scientists split the atom for the first time, ushering in the nuclear age; renowned German physicist Werner Heisenberg (1932 Nobel Prize winner) was charged with building an atom bomb; the United States responded by sending a baseball player to assassinate him. It's 1944 Zurich and two men exchange uncomfortable glances across a dimly lit room. \n\nWe then flashback 8 years to see Moe Berg utilizing his gut instincts to survive as a veteran journeyman catcher for the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. We later learn his sixth sense is not limited to the baseball diamond, and is used in situations much more important than whether a baserunner is stealing a base. Growing up Jewish, Berg had always been somewhat of an outsider, admitting, "I don't fit in." In baseball, they called him a walking enigma. Educated at Princeton, Columbia and Sorbonne in Paris, Berg spoke several languages, had a 'fake' wife, was a regular on quiz shows, and was constantly followed by insinuations of homosexuality ... though he only admitted to being good at keeping secrets.\n\nBerg's is a truly fascinating story, but unfortunately Paul Rudd is a bit overmatched in the lead role. He just doesn't quite have the dramatic acting chops to convey the intellectual depth of the man. However, the rest of the cast is stellar: Paul Giamatti (as Samuel Goudsmit), Connie Nielsen, Mark Strong (Heisenberg), Sienna Miller, Hiroyuki Sanada, Guy Pearce, Jeff Daniels (as William J Donovan), Tom Wilkinson (as Paul Scherrer), Giancarlo Giannini (a 50+ year career), and Shea Whigham (as Joe Cronin). Many of these are little more than cameos, and the choppy feel of the film's flow prevents us from ever really connecting to characters. \n\nAn extended battle scene volleys from intense and well-filmed to slightly comical as Mr. Giamatti is forced to run and dodge bullets. The look, tone and color palette of the film is quite similar to Spielberg's BRIDGE OF SPIES (another true story), though this current one pales in comparison, as director Lewin presents it as a "will he won't he kill the guy?" scenario. Berg's story is likely more suited to documentary treatment, as his time with the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS, later the CIA), resulted in his being awarded the Medal of Freedom. Upon his death in 1972, Newsweek's headline read "3rd String Catcher, 1st String Spy".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8864,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2018-06-22","keywords":"espionage,spy,baseball,baseball player,boston red sox","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2587998233","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5N2JmYmMtNzQzNy00N2E5LWJhZjktMDQ5YmFmYjI4ZDE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5N2JmYmMtNzQzNy00N2E5LWJhZjktMDQ5YmFmYjI4ZDE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Catcher Was a Spy tells the true story of Morris "Moe" Berg (Paul Rudd), the Major League Baseball player, Ivy League graduate, attorney and top-secret spy who helped the U.S. defeat Nazi Germany in the race to build the atomic bomb."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0269419/","name":"Pierfrancesco Favino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0929489/","name":"Tom Wilkinson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506802/","name":"Ben Lewin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092860/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0240363/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7260546/","name":"Nicholas Dawidoff"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I feel this movie aces both.\n\nA secluded environment and very good original music set the mood for full focus on story and character development. The plot twists time and time again as an intelligence power-play is delivered with very good performances by this little known cast. Character development feels perfect as each one gains depth without loosing essence.\n\nFrom a sci-fi point of view, it's not you're typical FX based movie, nor is it an action film.

I feel this movie aces both.\n\nA secluded environment and very good original music set the mood for full focus on story and character development. The plot twists time and time again as an intelligence power-play is delivered with very good performances by this little known cast. Character development feels perfect as each one gains depth without loosing essence.\n\nFrom a sci-fi point of view, it's not you're typical FX based movie, nor is it an action film.

I've never been misled, even when an equal number of viewers liked and disliked the same movie because that let me know there was a matter of taste in play, and that's fine. Sometimes a movie pleases everyone, but that's so rare I cant really think of one. People have different tastes and that's good. But the value of IMDb reviews is that they are based on a genuine response to the movie - not a bias, or some other agenda.\n\nFor example, the Fox critic Roger Friedman listed this movie as one of the worst of 2008 - without having seen the movie. That's right. He rated it without seeing it. It was a classic and reprehensible case of bias and perhaps even bigotry since he was engaging in Tom Cruise bashing which is usually practiced in conjunction with dissing Tom's religion.\n\nSo I don't trust critics to tell the truth or give an unbiased review.\n\nI saw Valkyrie and enjoyed it immensely. I've studied the Hitler period and was familiar with most of the events but the movie educated me while it thrilled and entertained me. It is a movie I was happy to take my teen-aged children to see because it also educated and entertained them. I thought the cast did a great job. The script was outstanding and the direction excellent. Tom Cruise gave a dimension to Von Stauffenberg that deepened my understanding of the events. The supporting cast were brilliant. \n\nI highly recommend it.\n\nPS. It's some time since I wrote this review and I took thirty minutes tonight to read the other reviews on this movie, not surprisingly they are mostly very positive and unanimous in praising it. Interestingly, the critics, including the one named above, who trashed the movie without even seeing it, obviously did so in an effort to kill it at the box office. While many other reviewers noted this too, I'd like to point out that those critics and possibly some of the people who 'dont like Tom Cruise because of his weird religion' are actually following the same path that made it possible for Hitler to kill off millions of Jews who also had a 'weird religion'.

However, this movie gives a brutal insight into some meaningless and worthless lives, of which plenty exists in our world. It is wonderfully played and directed, while the storyline sticks to the real stigma of low-life, survival, and struggle.\n\nWhy am I writing this? I was only 17-years old when I was desperate to escape a wretched child and youthhood. Back then, I met a woman who made me feel comfortable, loved an understood; never mind she was 6 years my senior and was mother to three children from her first marriage. I fell for her - and failed but struggled on for an unbelievable 45 years.\n\nIf some state here that this movie is nothing more than a 'wandering tale', than I dare to argue that that is what life is. Life is not fixed, nor does it proceed steadily. There are always difficulties, arguments, disagreements, and struggles. Even more so when people hit the lows and must live with little or no prospects. However, life can get compelling and testing when relationships evolve that have not much hope from the outset.\n\nThis movie leads the viewer in a very realistic surround of financial and relational struggles. To intensify the story, Weyland (Pablo) plays a character who was just released from prison after 15 years, meaning he would have had no real prospects of getting a fair chance or a decent job.

However, this movie gives a brutal insight into some meaningless and worthless lives, of which plenty exists in our world. It is wonderfully played and directed, while the storyline sticks to the real stigma of low-life, survival, and struggle.\n\nWhy am I writing this? I was only 17-years old when I was desperate to escape a wretched child and youthhood. Back then, I met a woman who made me feel comfortable, loved an understood; never mind she was 6 years my senior and was mother to three children from her first marriage. I fell for her - and failed but struggled on for an unbelievable 45 years.\n\nIf some state here that this movie is nothing more than a 'wandering tale', than I dare to argue that that is what life is. Life is not fixed, nor does it proceed steadily. There are always difficulties, arguments, disagreements, and struggles. Even more so when people hit the lows and must live with little or no prospects. However, life can get compelling and testing when relationships evolve that have not much hope from the outset.\n\nThis movie leads the viewer in a very realistic surround of financial and relational struggles. To intensify the story, Weyland (Pablo) plays a character who was just released from prison after 15 years, meaning he would have had no real prospects of getting a fair chance or a decent job. Indeed, that gives the story another edge while leading the viewer in a world, 'normal' people cannot relate to.\n\nOverall, it is a movie worth watching. It may seem boring for some, but others may find some resemblances to their own lives, past or present. The actors played their roles well and realistic, while I give credit to the director for packing so much real-life' into a small movie.\n\nI really did enjoy and digest this great story.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":997,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-07-30","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1980416025","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After 15 years in prison, Wayland (Pablo Schreiber) reunites with his high school girlfriend, Dolores (Jena Malone), who is now a single mother of three.

However, this movie gives a brutal insight into some meaningless and worthless lives, of which plenty exists in our world. It is wonderfully played and directed, while the storyline sticks to the real stigma of low-life, survival, and struggle.\n\nWhy am I writing this? I was only 17-years old when I was desperate to escape a wretched child and youthhood. Back then, I met a woman who made me feel comfortable, loved an understood; never mind she was 6 years my senior and was mother to three children from her first marriage. I fell for her - and failed but struggled on for an unbelievable 45 years.\n\nIf some state here that this movie is nothing more than a 'wandering tale', than I dare to argue that that is what life is. Life is not fixed, nor does it proceed steadily. There are always difficulties, arguments, disagreements, and struggles. Even more so when people hit the lows and must live with little or no prospects. However, life can get compelling and testing when relationships evolve that have not much hope from the outset.\n\nThis movie leads the viewer in a very realistic surround of financial and relational struggles. To intensify the story, Weyland (Pablo) plays a character who was just released from prison after 15 years, meaning he would have had no real prospects of getting a fair chance or a decent job. Indeed, that gives the story another edge while leading the viewer in a world, 'normal' people cannot relate to.\n\nOverall, it is a movie worth watching. It may seem boring for some, but others may find some resemblances to their own lives, past or present. The actors played their roles well and realistic, while I give credit to the director for packing so much real-life' into a small movie.\n\nI really did enjoy and digest this great story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":997,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-07-30","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1980416025","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After 15 years in prison, Wayland (Pablo Schreiber) reunites with his high school girlfriend, Dolores (Jena Malone), who is now a single mother of three.

However, this movie gives a brutal insight into some meaningless and worthless lives, of which plenty exists in our world. It is wonderfully played and directed, while the storyline sticks to the real stigma of low-life, survival, and struggle.\n\nWhy am I writing this? I was only 17-years old when I was desperate to escape a wretched child and youthhood. Back then, I met a woman who made me feel comfortable, loved an understood; never mind she was 6 years my senior and was mother to three children from her first marriage. I fell for her - and failed but struggled on for an unbelievable 45 years.\n\nIf some state here that this movie is nothing more than a 'wandering tale', than I dare to argue that that is what life is. Life is not fixed, nor does it proceed steadily. There are always difficulties, arguments, disagreements, and struggles. Even more so when people hit the lows and must live with little or no prospects. However, life can get compelling and testing when relationships evolve that have not much hope from the outset.\n\nThis movie leads the viewer in a very realistic surround of financial and relational struggles. To intensify the story, Weyland (Pablo) plays a character who was just released from prison after 15 years, meaning he would have had no real prospects of getting a fair chance or a decent job. Indeed, that gives the story another edge while leading the viewer in a world, 'normal' people cannot relate to.\n\nOverall, it is a movie worth watching. It may seem boring for some, but others may find some resemblances to their own lives, past or present. The actors played their roles well and realistic, while I give credit to the director for packing so much real-life' into a small movie.\n\nI really did enjoy and digest this great story.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":997,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-07-30","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1980416025","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After 15 years in prison, Wayland (Pablo Schreiber) reunites with his high school girlfriend, Dolores (Jena Malone), who is now a single mother of three.

Don Siegel's film is based on the true story of an attempted escape. Some aspects are clichéd (the psychopathic homosexual, for example) and by concentrating on the brutality of the regime the film gets you on the side of the escapees at the price of suggesting that prison break-outs are actually a good thing.

Don Siegel's film is based on the true story of an attempted escape. Some aspects are clichéd (the psychopathic homosexual, for example) and by concentrating on the brutality of the regime the film gets you on the side of the escapees at the price of suggesting that prison break-outs are actually a good thing. But in general, this is a successful film that has aged well, with no sickly sentiment or overdone melodrama; by concentrating on the unadorned details of the story, the film allows each one to count. A strong, uncompromising movie, gripping even if you know the ending before it starts.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":127074,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Biography","Crime"],"datePublished":"1979-06-22","keywords":"escape,prison,island,prison island,1960s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4045127193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E5NjhiNWYtNThmYy00ZTA1LTg4ZWMtMWQ3YzA3NWFiMjA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E5NjhiNWYtNThmYy00ZTA1LTg4ZWMtMWQ3YzA3NWFiMjA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001526/","name":"Patrick McGoohan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089348/","name":"Roberts Blossom"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0796923/","name":"Don Siegel"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102264/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115431/","name":"J.

Each is known for disappearing into their roles, and with the combination of Proulx's perfect characters (misfits) the actors seemed engulfed. \n\nQuoyle (Kevin-- clearing a spot for a few award trinkets as we speak- Spacey) is a sad, nearly nonexistent man. He gets no respect from anyone he holds near and dear. He's a guy you pass on the street and may remark at, if only to notice how sad he appears. His life is nothing spectacular. His story? His story is another kettle of boiling water all together \n\nHis life takes a few dramatic turns as we meet him. His gallivanting wife Petal (Cate Blanchett) has absconded with their young daughter Bunny and his parents have done something equally dramatic. The events find him thrown together with his tough-as-nails Newfoundland born aunt Agnis Hamm (Dame Judi Dench). With his run of luck at the deeper end of long over, she invites him to try a fresh start, up there.\n\nHe's got nothing to lose so follows her up to his family's historic birthplace. A barren rock his people called home, only forty odd years ago, called Killick-Claw. Think, middle of nowhere with fantastic cliff and ocean views and the restaurant is the only restaurant. Small, quaint and a perfect place to hide from your troubles and the world.\n\nHe and his precocious, and "sensitive," daughter Bunny are adjusting and getting to know their new neighbors on the small hamlet, that appears to never see the season of summer.\n\nQuoyle is experiencing a newfound meaning to life (his life especially)in Newfoundland. He is hired as a small-time reporter for the local rag-mag and community pulse serving paper The Gammy Bird. His writing starts to affect all aspects of his mundane life.\n\nHe also meets an equally sad and sullen gal named Wavey (Julianne "Best Actress 2002" Moore). She' s a widow who wears her heart on her sleeve and is weary of starting any new romances. Poor Quoyle. \n\nMysterious happenings and awakenings start to emerge all around Quoyle as well as a new sense of self, friendships and life. What's it mean?\n\n The Shipping News is old time story telling at it's finest. Newfoundland in itself is a bit of a mystical place to most of us. Proulx creates her story's characters so rich in dimension with that same timeless appeal like a Huck Finn or Nicholas Nickleby, one expects to look them up in the local phone book when in town. But it's the subtle expert performances for subtle yet animated characters make this simply a masterpiece. The award shows are going to be quite redundant this year... A Beautiful Mind and its wonderful cast and performances will be The Shipping News' only competition in the BIG 3 categories - for sure. \n\n Spacey (whom I adore to the point of actually being speechless in front of), brings us, perhaps, his finest performance to date in Quoyle (pronounced coil). Kev reveals Quoyle's soul is wounded and yet his heart, even with all the injustices it has faced in its forty-something years that should be bitter and hard, manages to pound sweet, strong and hopeful. It's an unbelievable performance. Not that I'm surprised This man is a\n\nscrumptious treat for the senses not unlike like fresh fried Ipswich clams drizzled in tarter sauce with a side of old fashioned delectable helping of New England style cole slaw! \n\nWhy's Spacey so great? Is it because he hung with Jack Lemmon in his formative years as an actor? Or because (like myself) he adores the complicated gritty works of Eugene O'Neill? Perhaps, because he makes himself aloof to keep his personality out of his films, thusly making himself completely disappear into the film? Um yeah. Disagree? Get your own review. K-PAX aside, his work always brilliant, intense, or funny, or light it's what ever he wants it to be. I'd breed with the man, sure, but I'm also sure I will not be alone in my admiration for his performance here. Sorry, Russell, your also grand and one helluva actor, but your "butt" has been elegantly drop kicked by Cadet Fowler for the mad mad race for Oscar \n\nJudi Dench is, as always, an inspiration on film. \n\nJulianne Moore (Wavey) worked her plane Jane gorgeous self into a yarn of great depth and feeling. We wanted to make her tea and give her a hug by the end of the film.\n\nCate "I'm in every movie on the marquee this winter" Blanchett is a chameleon- somebody check her body temperature and dining habits! As Quale's rude, nasty, sluty bimbette squared love interest, Petal, she makes you loath her within the first forty-eight frames.\n\nPetal and Quoyle's offspring, little "Bunny", was played by triplets Alyssa, Kaitlyn, and Lauren Gainer. These gals could give Haley Joel Osment a run for his bubblegum money. They played beside veteran thespians like it was their birthright. You can picture the little dolls finished with their scenes sneaking off to be kids again "please pass the play dough, please, I'm done with my scene mum."\n\nPete "Kobayashi" Postlewaite plays Quoyle's nemesis at the paper with tons of humor and that smoothness of delivery he's so famous for. Love this man.\n\nWelsh and Sheppard's Pie of a manly man, actor Ryhs Ifans ( Little Nicky, Notting Hill) was adorable as Quoyle's new friend B. Beaufield Nutbeem. It was such a pleasure to see him- on so many different levels.\n\n Director, Lasse Hallstrom (My Life as a Dog, Cider House Rules) is famous for quirky studies on the human condition. Here he's strung his cast together like a Newfoundland fisherman's net and draws them so tightly together so as not a syllable of dialog slips away. In lesser hands The Shipping News could have been a sentimental sugar encrusted bakers dozen of stale over done leaden donuts.\n\nThere's so many more involved and each deserves accolades for bringing an already warm story to the screen with a remarkable toasty reality that makes you laugh, stir, and wonder  I feel bad for Ron Howard. He finally gets a nod or two and he has to be up against this film. \n\nSnack recommendation: Plain Donuts, fried octopus tentacle sandwiches and tea\n\nHeadline: The Shipping News looms over small cinema. Crowds, hearing the buzz, rush to see it opening day! The masses exclaim:" for once a film is better than its hype."\n\nBlunt Aside: Have you noticed the names I've listed; Petal Wavey, Bunny? That's just some of Proulx's magic. She chooses her names in such a way as to metaphorically manipulate your mind without your even knowing it. Even Quoyle has significance.

There was never a perfect person around. You just have half-angel and half-devil in you." \n\nThis line delivered by Linda Manz in Terrence Malick's gorgeous masterpiece, 'Days of Heaven,' sums up everything you need to know about life on earth. Much of Malick's themes have been devoted to man versus nature, and the idea of perfection is not outside that realm - imperfection is the nature of mankind.\n\nRichard Gere, in his greatest performance, plays Bill, a hot headed, lower class worker, who in a moment of mistake accidentally kills his boss in a Chicago factory. We see that the boss is hassling Bill, but we never know why, we just see faces but no distinguishable voices over the roar of the factory. Bill, his sister (Manz) and his girlfriend Abby, played by Brooke Adams, take off for the panhandle, hitching a ride on a train. Bill and Abby tell everyone that they are all brothers and sisters, because as you know, "people talk." They find work on a farm owned by the rich farmer, played by Sam Shepard. Many other films would make the farmer the bad guy, giving him trade mark heel characteristics, but Shepard's farmer, who we learn is dying, is soulful, and yearning for love. He see's Abby, and is interested, and eventually will ask her to stay - after Bill hears the doctor tell him he has about a year to live. They decide to stay, and after some persuasion from Bill, Abby will marry the dying farmer so that they can be heir to his fortune. Suspicions arise, and hearts and lives are broken, and the Days of Heaven will come to a halting end.\n\nThe cinematography is some of the most breathtaking ever captured on film. 'Days of Heaven' could even considered a masterpiece for its aesthetic beauty alone, if the story were not so terrific. Everything about the film is magnificent. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting and beautiful. You will remember it forever, along with Linda Manz' unforgettable narration, likely one of the greatest voice overs in film history. Many have criticized Malick's distancing techniques and muted emotions. We are always kept at arms length away. But these people don't realize that the story is a memory, a memory from the real main character - Linda. Also, in a method that Robert Bresson used, by distancing us emotionally, it leaves us to add our own emotions and imaginations in the story, heightening the power of the film, as long as you are willing not to be spoon-fed what to think.\n\nTerrence Malick is a filmmaker who came out of nowhere with his talents already fulfilled, and he has not stopped since. His films are filled with such heartbreaking beauty and symbolism, and he is one of the few living filmmakers who truly are creating art, rather than just entertainment. He had one of the greatest debuts ever, in the mesmerizing and haunting 'Badlands,' the deepest and most philosophical 'The Thin Red Line,' which is likely the greatest contemporary war film (as suggested by the late Gene Siskel)and the stunningly beautiful 'The New World.'

There was never a perfect person around. You just have half-angel and half-devil in you." \n\nThis line delivered by Linda Manz in Terrence Malick's gorgeous masterpiece, 'Days of Heaven,' sums up everything you need to know about life on earth. Much of Malick's themes have been devoted to man versus nature, and the idea of perfection is not outside that realm - imperfection is the nature of mankind.\n\nRichard Gere, in his greatest performance, plays Bill, a hot headed, lower class worker, who in a moment of mistake accidentally kills his boss in a Chicago factory. We see that the boss is hassling Bill, but we never know why, we just see faces but no distinguishable voices over the roar of the factory. Bill, his sister (Manz) and his girlfriend Abby, played by Brooke Adams, take off for the panhandle, hitching a ride on a train. Bill and Abby tell everyone that they are all brothers and sisters, because as you know, "people talk." They find work on a farm owned by the rich farmer, played by Sam Shepard. Many other films would make the farmer the bad guy, giving him trade mark heel characteristics, but Shepard's farmer, who we learn is dying, is soulful, and yearning for love. He see's Abby, and is interested, and eventually will ask her to stay - after Bill hears the doctor tell him he has about a year to live. They decide to stay, and after some persuasion from Bill, Abby will marry the dying farmer so that they can be heir to his fortune. Suspicions arise, and hearts and lives are broken, and the Days of Heaven will come to a halting end.\n\nThe cinematography is some of the most breathtaking ever captured on film. 'Days of Heaven' could even considered a masterpiece for its aesthetic beauty alone, if the story were not so terrific. Everything about the film is magnificent. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting and beautiful. You will remember it forever, along with Linda Manz' unforgettable narration, likely one of the greatest voice overs in film history. Many have criticized Malick's distancing techniques and muted emotions. We are always kept at arms length away. But these people don't realize that the story is a memory, a memory from the real main character - Linda. Also, in a method that Robert Bresson used, by distancing us emotionally, it leaves us to add our own emotions and imaginations in the story, heightening the power of the film, as long as you are willing not to be spoon-fed what to think.\n\nTerrence Malick is a filmmaker who came out of nowhere with his talents already fulfilled, and he has not stopped since. His films are filled with such heartbreaking beauty and symbolism, and he is one of the few living filmmakers who truly are creating art, rather than just entertainment. He had one of the greatest debuts ever, in the mesmerizing and haunting 'Badlands,' the deepest and most philosophical 'The Thin Red Line,' which is likely the greatest contemporary war film (as suggested by the late Gene Siskel)and the stunningly beautiful 'The New World.' His films are deep and meaningful, and to get into the underlying symbolism and themes of them here would be pointless, and better saved for a long essay.\n\nDays of Heaven is one of the greatest, and most beautiful films ever made. Cinema is at a low point recently, but as long as Terrence Malick is still making films, we still have some heavenly art to look forward to.\n\nPS - Hopefully someone like Criterion will create a new DVD, as the current one has some soundtrack problems. Imagine seeing it restored, visually and audibly.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55491,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1978-10-06","keywords":"farm,train,wealth,farm worker,seasonal work","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi320650777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000724/","name":"Brooke Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001731/","name":"Sam Shepard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Each is known for disappearing into their roles, and with the combination of Proulx's perfect characters (misfits) the actors seemed engulfed. \n\nQuoyle (Kevin-- clearing a spot for a few award trinkets as we speak- Spacey) is a sad, nearly nonexistent man. He gets no respect from anyone he holds near and dear. He's a guy you pass on the street and may remark at, if only to notice how sad he appears. His life is nothing spectacular. His story? His story is another kettle of boiling water all together \n\nHis life takes a few dramatic turns as we meet him. His gallivanting wife Petal (Cate Blanchett) has absconded with their young daughter Bunny and his parents have done something equally dramatic. The events find him thrown together with his tough-as-nails Newfoundland born aunt Agnis Hamm (Dame Judi Dench). With his run of luck at the deeper end of long over, she invites him to try a fresh start, up there.\n\nHe's got nothing to lose so follows her up to his family's historic birthplace. A barren rock his people called home, only forty odd years ago, called Killick-Claw. Think, middle of nowhere with fantastic cliff and ocean views and the restaurant is the only restaurant. Small, quaint and a perfect place to hide from your troubles and the world.\n\nHe and his precocious, and "sensitive," daughter Bunny are adjusting and getting to know their new neighbors on the small hamlet, that appears to never see the season of summer.\n\nQuoyle is experiencing a newfound meaning to life (his life especially)in Newfoundland. He is hired as a small-time reporter for the local rag-mag and community pulse serving paper The Gammy Bird. His writing starts to affect all aspects of his mundane life.\n\nHe also meets an equally sad and sullen gal named Wavey (Julianne "Best Actress 2002" Moore). She' s a widow who wears her heart on her sleeve and is weary of starting any new romances. Poor Quoyle. \n\nMysterious happenings and awakenings start to emerge all around Quoyle as well as a new sense of self, friendships and life. What's it mean?\n\n The Shipping News is old time story telling at it's finest. Newfoundland in itself is a bit of a mystical place to most of us. Proulx creates her story's characters so rich in dimension with that same timeless appeal like a Huck Finn or Nicholas Nickleby, one expects to look them up in the local phone book when in town. But it's the subtle expert performances for subtle yet animated characters make this simply a masterpiece. The award shows are going to be quite redundant this year... A Beautiful Mind and its wonderful cast and performances will be The Shipping News' only competition in the BIG 3 categories - for sure. \n\n Spacey (whom I adore to the point of actually being speechless in front of), brings us, perhaps, his finest performance to date in Quoyle (pronounced coil). Kev reveals Quoyle's soul is wounded and yet his heart, even with all the injustices it has faced in its forty-something years that should be bitter and hard, manages to pound sweet, strong and hopeful. It's an unbelievable performance. Not that I'm surprised This man is a\n\nscrumptious treat for the senses not unlike like fresh fried Ipswich clams drizzled in tarter sauce with a side of old fashioned delectable helping of New England style cole slaw! \n\nWhy's Spacey so great? Is it because he hung with Jack Lemmon in his formative years as an actor? Or because (like myself) he adores the complicated gritty works of Eugene O'Neill? Perhaps, because he makes himself aloof to keep his personality out of his films, thusly making himself completely disappear into the film? Um yeah. Disagree? Get your own review. K-PAX aside, his work always brilliant, intense, or funny, or light it's what ever he wants it to be. I'd breed with the man, sure, but I'm also sure I will not be alone in my admiration for his performance here. Sorry, Russell, your also grand and one helluva actor, but your "butt" has been elegantly drop kicked by Cadet Fowler for the mad mad race for Oscar \n\nJudi Dench is, as always, an inspiration on film. \n\nJulianne Moore (Wavey) worked her plane Jane gorgeous self into a yarn of great depth and feeling. We wanted to make her tea and give her a hug by the end of the film.\n\nCate "I'm in every movie on the marquee this winter" Blanchett is a chameleon- somebody check her body temperature and dining habits! As Quale's rude, nasty, sluty bimbette squared love interest, Petal, she makes you loath her within the first forty-eight frames.\n\nPetal and Quoyle's offspring, little "Bunny", was played by triplets Alyssa, Kaitlyn, and Lauren Gainer. These gals could give Haley Joel Osment a run for his bubblegum money. They played beside veteran thespians like it was their birthright.

Love this man.\n\nWelsh and Sheppard's Pie of a manly man, actor Ryhs Ifans ( Little Nicky, Notting Hill) was adorable as Quoyle's new friend B. Beaufield Nutbeem. It was such a pleasure to see him- on so many different levels.\n\n Director, Lasse Hallstrom (My Life as a Dog, Cider House Rules) is famous for quirky studies on the human condition. Here he's strung his cast together like a Newfoundland fisherman's net and draws them so tightly together so as not a syllable of dialog slips away. In lesser hands The Shipping News could have been a sentimental sugar encrusted bakers dozen of stale over done leaden donuts.\n\nThere's so many more involved and each deserves accolades for bringing an already warm story to the screen with a remarkable toasty reality that makes you laugh, stir, and wonder  I feel bad for Ron Howard. He finally gets a nod or two and he has to be up against this film. \n\nSnack recommendation: Plain Donuts, fried octopus tentacle sandwiches and tea\n\nHeadline: The Shipping News looms over small cinema. Crowds, hearing the buzz, rush to see it opening day! The masses exclaim:" for once a film is better than its hype."\n\nBlunt Aside: Have you noticed the names I've listed; Petal Wavey, Bunny? That's just some of Proulx's magic. She chooses her names in such a way as to metaphorically manipulate your mind without your even knowing it. Even Quoyle has significance. After you see the film (which is mandatory) the names will come gloriously into the light.

Crowds, hearing the buzz, rush to see it opening day! The masses exclaim:" for once a film is better than its hype."\n\nBlunt Aside: Have you noticed the names I've listed; Petal Wavey, Bunny? That's just some of Proulx's magic. She chooses her names in such a way as to metaphorically manipulate your mind without your even knowing it. Even Quoyle has significance. After you see the film (which is mandatory) the names will come gloriously into the light. Trust me.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32516,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-12-25","keywords":"newspaper,pantyhose,ship,wake,husband wife relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Shipping News","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2899353113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM3ZWUyZjctY2JhMS00YTg4LWIxN2QtZTg1OTM0OTI1MGVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM3ZWUyZjctY2JhMS00YTg4LWIxN2QtZTg1OTM0OTI1MGVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000228/","name":"Kevin Spacey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002120/","name":"Lasse Hallström"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698925/","name":"Annie Proulx","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414608/","name":"Robert Nelson Jacobs"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There was never a perfect person around. You just have half-angel and half-devil in you." \n\nThis line delivered by Linda Manz in Terrence Malick's gorgeous masterpiece, 'Days of Heaven,' sums up everything you need to know about life on earth. Much of Malick's themes have been devoted to man versus nature, and the idea of perfection is not outside that realm - imperfection is the nature of mankind.\n\nRichard Gere, in his greatest performance, plays Bill, a hot headed, lower class worker, who in a moment of mistake accidentally kills his boss in a Chicago factory. We see that the boss is hassling Bill, but we never know why, we just see faces but no distinguishable voices over the roar of the factory. Bill, his sister (Manz) and his girlfriend Abby, played by Brooke Adams, take off for the panhandle, hitching a ride on a train. Bill and Abby tell everyone that they are all brothers and sisters, because as you know, "people talk." They find work on a farm owned by the rich farmer, played by Sam Shepard. Many other films would make the farmer the bad guy, giving him trade mark heel characteristics, but Shepard's farmer, who we learn is dying, is soulful, and yearning for love. He see's Abby, and is interested, and eventually will ask her to stay - after Bill hears the doctor tell him he has about a year to live. They decide to stay, and after some persuasion from Bill, Abby will marry the dying farmer so that they can be heir to his fortune. Suspicions arise, and hearts and lives are broken, and the Days of Heaven will come to a halting end.\n\nThe cinematography is some of the most breathtaking ever captured on film. 'Days of Heaven' could even considered a masterpiece for its aesthetic beauty alone, if the story were not so terrific. Everything about the film is magnificent. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting and beautiful. You will remember it forever, along with Linda Manz' unforgettable narration, likely one of the greatest voice overs in film history. Many have criticized Malick's distancing techniques and muted emotions. We are always kept at arms length away. But these people don't realize that the story is a memory, a memory from the real main character - Linda. Also, in a method that Robert Bresson used, by distancing us emotionally, it leaves us to add our own emotions and imaginations in the story, heightening the power of the film, as long as you are willing not to be spoon-fed what to think.\n\nTerrence Malick is a filmmaker who came out of nowhere with his talents already fulfilled, and he has not stopped since. His films are filled with such heartbreaking beauty and symbolism, and he is one of the few living filmmakers who truly are creating art, rather than just entertainment. He had one of the greatest debuts ever, in the mesmerizing and haunting 'Badlands,' the deepest and most philosophical 'The Thin Red Line,' which is likely the greatest contemporary war film (as suggested by the late Gene Siskel)and the stunningly beautiful 'The New World.' His films are deep and meaningful, and to get into the underlying symbolism and themes of them here would be pointless, and better saved for a long essay.\n\nDays of Heaven is one of the greatest, and most beautiful films ever made. Cinema is at a low point recently, but as long as Terrence Malick is still making films, we still have some heavenly art to look forward to.\n\nPS - Hopefully someone like Criterion will create a new DVD, as the current one has some soundtrack problems. Imagine seeing it restored, visually and audibly.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55491,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1978-10-06","keywords":"farm,train,wealth,farm worker,seasonal work","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi320650777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJiMmI5OWYtMzFiNC00NjYyLWJhNzctOWViM2VmOTM2YWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000152/","name":"Richard Gere"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000724/","name":"Brooke Adams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001731/","name":"Sam Shepard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To quote Kelly Golighty "She reminds me of Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady with a dash of Lucille Ball thrown in for good measure."","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6850,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-03-29","keywords":"tape over mouth,tied feet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi256354073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDkwODQ0ODE5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU5NDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDkwODQ0ODE5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU5NDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Frustrated by her parent's lack of support and guidance, 16-year-old Emily takes her mom and dad hostage after they miss her big jump-roping competition in hopes that it will restore order in their home.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0155693/","name":"Kristin Chenoweth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000546/","name":"Matthew Modine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0750037/","name":"Olesya Rulin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1219307/","name":"Benjamin Epps"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0291634/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014925/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3213569/","name":"Matt K.

It has all the elements to make it an award winning piece. Great complicated characters that work well with each other, mystery, intrigue, excitement, shell shock, suggestive, authentic and genuine. Who new that Germany had the ability to produce a show like this that would compete with BBC period series. It is well written and the cinematography and sets really take you back to what it could have been in Berlin 1920s. The poverty, life, rich, poor, politics, morality, ethics and corruption are all part of the story. I have the benefit of being able to watch this with English subtitles or I would have missed the opportunity to really enjoy this show. Unfortunately, whom ever translated it, their English is not the first language and at times the sentences are backwards in English which is normally when someone is translating verbatim but I get the gist of it. If you like time pieces and or like shows such as Endeavor, George Gently, Trapped, Modus and similar then you are likely to enjoy this program.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21197,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-10-13","keywords":"berlin germany,1920s,police,weimar republic,interwar period","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1432815/","name":"Volker Bruch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2939186/","name":"Liv Lisa Fries"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2914059/","name":"Leonie Benesch"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061958/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044017/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359634/","name":"Henk Handloegten"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0902022/","name":"Achim von Borries"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer Season 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2628238873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3YWI2YzctZjNmYS00OGRhLTk3MzgtNDA2ZWU3ZmVjODA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3YWI2YzctZjNmYS00OGRhLTk3MzgtNDA2ZWU3ZmVjODA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Those who might dismiss Endeavour as just another generic addition to an already overcrowded marketplace, however, would be making a grievous error.\n\nThe year is 1965 and an eccentric young Detective Constable, Endeavour Morse (Shaun Evans), is making waves at the Oxford City Police with not only his unorthodox but brilliant methods of deduction, but for his refusal to tow the line in order to please the upper echelons of both the Force and society. Under the steadfast guidance of the seasoned and similarly incorruptible, Fred Thursday (Roger Allam), Morse finds himself embroiled in a number of complex cases that expose him to the darker side of life and human nature.\n\nAlthough the series will naturally draw comparisons to its popular predecessor, thanks to the show's gripping narratives, vibrant swinging sixties backdrop and perfect blend of light and dark overtones, Endeavour is easily able to distinguish itself by its own considerable merits. \n\nMuch of the show's success can be attributed to the ingenious casting of Evans, who puts his own unique stamp on the iconic role. Of course there are parallels to the world weary DI so expertly embodied by John Thaw, but Evans wisely avoids imitation, as the twenty-year age difference between the two interpretations allows the actor to create something fresh. The addition of the character of Fred Thursday is inspired. The street wise, war veteran is the perfect mentor for the idealistic Morse and their relationship is one of the highlights of the series. Fantastic entertainment on every level!\n\nhttp://infilmandtvland.wordpress.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21681,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-01-02","keywords":"1960s,police,oxford england,nylon feet,tights","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140345/","name":"Shaun Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019885/","name":"Roger Allam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103495/","name":"James Bradshaw"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0221332/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2451094041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""Endeavour" returns for a Season 4."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The show in and of itself is nothing to write home about, a basic pairing of mixed gender characters with a love/hate relationship (that will more than likely veer into a romantic direction- let us all pray not) who want to avoid admitting the obvious fact that they work well together and are made for each other.

I feel the show is a refreshing break from the dark, high-paced, slapstick comedy, reality hungry barrage of television we've been reduced to. It's clean, it's funny, it's cultural and it's light. That deserves a well done in my book! Personal hopes for the show: they keep Villa's and Rosie's relationship friendly.

The show in and of itself is nothing to write home about, a basic pairing of mixed gender characters with a love/hate relationship (that will more than likely veer into a romantic direction- let us all pray not) who want to avoid admitting the obvious fact that they work well together and are made for each other. This has been done repeatedly and frankly beat over viewers heads when mixed with the typical cop, CSI drama.

I feel the show is a refreshing break from the dark, high-paced, slapstick comedy, reality hungry barrage of television we've been reduced to. It's clean, it's funny, it's cultural and it's light. That deserves a well done in my book! Personal hopes for the show: they keep Villa's and Rosie's relationship friendly.

I loved seeing Morris Chesnut in a role where he really shines. The fact that he's gorgeous is not relative to his character, an overly optimistic, happy-go-lucky pain in Villa's butt.I didn't feel like that was overly played, some viewers Posed his character as cocky because he mentions himself in quirky ways, but it's actually a play on his sarcastic comedy. The show in and of itself is nothing to write home about, a basic pairing of mixed gender characters with a love/hate relationship (that will more than likely veer into a romantic direction- let us all pray not) who want to avoid admitting the obvious fact that they work well together and are made for each other. This has been done repeatedly and frankly beat over viewers heads when mixed with the typical cop, CSI drama. However, the mixture of Villa and Rosie's characters are nice and their acting both together and individually is growing on me with every episode.I love the positive family atmosphere and feel that all the supporting actors do well with each other and at holding their own. I feel the show is a refreshing break from the dark, high-paced, slapstick comedy, reality hungry barrage of television we've been reduced to. It's clean, it's funny, it's cultural and it's light. That deserves a well done in my book! Personal hopes for the show: they keep Villa's and Rosie's relationship friendly. They bring back Nicole Ari Parker as his love interest (that was a lame excuse for a break up!), they continue to advance the cases they work on to be more interesting.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7405,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2015-09-23","keywords":"laboratory,pathologist,deduction,heart condition,miami florida","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004820/","name":"Morris Chestnut","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1632786/","name":"Jaina Lee Ortiz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827488/","name":"Gabrielle Dennis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069651/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0555624/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1029960/","name":"Todd Harthan"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3235099417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2MDc5ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1NzQ1NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2MDc5ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1NzQ1NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official trailer for Rosewood on Fox."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Basic formula is (1) A client has an issue; (2) Bull's team select a jury; (3a) Bull's team noisily express exactly what's happening inside every jury's head with 100% accuracy; (3b) Bull's team struggle and look like they're going to lose; (4) New and compelling evidence is miraculously discovered by Bull's team, frequently showing Police/FBI/etc to be incompetent investigators (although this is not directly addressed); (5) Bull's team wins case while Jason Bull commentates his lawyer's brilliance in whispers.\n\nIt's a very simplistic show, which might appeal if that's what you're after, but could also be really annoying. For example, time scales are completely fictional. Bull's team is always urgently gathering evidence during a trial. They frequently break laws, hack computer systems, and invade people's privacy. ALL of these actions are brushed off as inconsequential and a justified means to an end for their client. His team made up from former employees of the FBI and Homeland Security are idolised as if those organisations are faultless.\n\nEarlier episodes spent considerable time talking about juries, but there's no detail... just someone in a room staring at screens and expressing what are supposedly 100% accurate explanations of what each juror is thinking. Uncertainty is very rare.\n\nI'm not very familiar with trial science but it's hard to imagine that it hits this degree of formulaic perfection. Maybe a disinterest in looking at that is why what is meant to be the main premise of the show is brushed over so superficially. If a show had to be based on trial science, there would be so many interesting things it could focus on: accuracy, ethics, just getting it to work, the list goes on. Bull doesn't. It's just an excessively simplistic legal drama.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16549,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830388/","name":"Jaime Lee Kirchner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Basic formula is (1) A client has an issue; (2) Bull's team select a jury; (3a) Bull's team noisily express exactly what's happening inside every jury's head with 100% accuracy; (3b) Bull's team struggle and look like they're going to lose; (4) New and compelling evidence is miraculously discovered by Bull's team, frequently showing Police/FBI/etc to be incompetent investigators (although this is not directly addressed); (5) Bull's team wins case while Jason Bull commentates his lawyer's brilliance in whispers.\n\nIt's a very simplistic show, which might appeal if that's what you're after, but could also be really annoying. For example, time scales are completely fictional. Bull's team is always urgently gathering evidence during a trial. They frequently break laws, hack computer systems, and invade people's privacy. ALL of these actions are brushed off as inconsequential and a justified means to an end for their client. His team made up from former employees of the FBI and Homeland Security are idolised as if those organisations are faultless.\n\nEarlier episodes spent considerable time talking about juries, but there's no detail... just someone in a room staring at screens and expressing what are supposedly 100% accurate explanations of what each juror is thinking. Uncertainty is very rare.\n\nI'm not very familiar with trial science but it's hard to imagine that it hits this degree of formulaic perfection. Maybe a disinterest in looking at that is why what is meant to be the main premise of the show is brushed over so superficially. If a show had to be based on trial science, there would be so many interesting things it could focus on: accuracy, ethics, just getting it to work, the list goes on. Bull doesn't. It's just an excessively simplistic legal drama.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16549,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830388/","name":"Jaime Lee Kirchner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="hr">The Nightingale: Directed by Jennifer Kent. With Aisling Franciosi, Michael Sheasby, Maya Christie, Addison Christie. Set in 1825, Clare, a young Irish convict woman, chases a British officer through the rugged Tasmanian wilderness, bent on revenge for a terrible act of violence he committed against her family.

Heartbreaking aftermath. Beautiful love story. Powerful history lesson. All in one. Worth every tear.","reviewBody":"I want to start by saying that I did not find The Nightingale excessively violent. And believe me, I hate movie violence. But I feel like I've seen trailers for action flicks that had more. Plenty of TV shows do as well. Maybe not rape, but still. Perhaps the reason it didn't feel excessive was because the movie doesn't dwell on it. It avoids gore, except in a few places where it really was necessary. Not only is there absolutely nothing gratuitous, each of those scenes has in it so much more than just "oh, look, they kill", "oh, look, they rape." For example, both women who are raped are mothers. Both are torn away from their very young children in the process. So, not only are they brutally violated, I was horrified thinking what must have been going through their minds knowing that the children are out there, helpless, crying, and they can't protect them.\n\nAt the center of the story is an Irish convict named Clare (Aisling Franciosi) and an aboriginal man named Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) whom she convinces to guide her through the wilderness to the men lead by Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin) who "took something from her". But it is nowhere near a simple revenge story.\n\nThe film offers a history lesson that might be more affecting than anything with names and dates. It's a sharp and clear look at what violence does to people, not just the victims, but the perpetrators too. It's easy to see what happened there earlier. White people take the land, the aboriginals fight them, soldiers brought in to fight them, the aboriginals fight back, and it spiraled on and on turning the whole place into the land of "bad spirits" that we find in the film. We see people that are dead, even if their bodies are still alive. The white woman holding a baby while looking at her burning house. An older aboriginal tracker forced to witness horrific violence against one of his own and then keep guiding the very perpetrators. A convict who saw two others killed right in front of him - tellingly one by an aboriginal and another by an officer.\n\nThe soldiers, who are there not exactly on their own free will, are taught to dehumanize the locals as well as the convicts they are guarding. We can see the beginnings of the process in the young officer and in the convict boy Hawkins takes a brief interest in. We can see how it's kill or be killed, quite possibly by one of your own. But by dehumanizing the others they are dehumanizing themselves eventually becoming like Hawkins and his hapless sidekick Ruse (Damon Herriman). The film doesn't let anyone off the hook. There's a heartbreaking scene that reminds us that even settlers who are nice and kind and, what we would now call, woke are still living on the stolen land.\n\nClare is an orphan who found herself having to steal to survive which landed her in that hell hole of a place as a young girl. Now 21 she finally has things starting to look up for her. A husband, a little hut, a beautiful baby girl. Life. Hope. But her long earned freedom is in the hands of Hawkins who is mildly infatuated with her and wants to keep her for himself. When her husband's ill conceived attempt to break her free brings on a horrible tragedy, she too is pulled into the vortex of violence. And Billy, who is trying to keep his head down and avoid trouble in spite of having suffered enormously from the colonizers, is pulled in along with her. But it is their relationship that holds them and the film together. Watching it move slowly from an understandable distrust to a deep bond melts your heart. To me it's really a love story.\n\nI found the film pulling me in like few have ever done. It was as if I was there, feeling what the characters were feeling as much as it can be possible sitting in my comfortable 21st century chair. I wasn't just grieving for them, I was grieving with them, a few times finding myself breaking down literally seconds before one of them did. This has never happened to me before. I think it's because everything flows so organically. Every mood change, every action, dream, nightmare is right in its place and palpably real. No small feat for something that is also rich with allegory. And the acting is fantastic across the board. Franciosi's performance is raw and alive, like a pulsating vein as she goes through a myriad of subtle changes of emotions. Layers of emotions. Clare never loses her vulnerability, no matter how much rage she is in or how much confidence she is trying to project. That's what makes her so compelling. Ganambarr is a revelation as Billy. He moves seamlessly, with barely a change of tone between being an occasional comic relief, talking about his culture with quiet, yet forceful passion, and revealing just how much he's been hurt, and he is perfect every step of the way. You can see the pain buried inside him slowly seeping out as the movie progresses. And Hawkins could have been a run of the mill villain, but Claflin fleshes him out as someone who commits violence not out of strength, but out of weakness. He is unable to control anything, from soldiers under his command to his own career. Impotent both figuratively and literally, he kills and rapes as a means of control. He doesn't enjoy sex or anything else for that matter. A miserable creature, even more disgusting than he is scary - perfectly befitting someone in the last stages of inner decay.\n\nThe film loses its momentum for a bit towards the end, but just barely. I found it a riveting, breathtaking, mesmerizing watch, well worth my every tear.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25065,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-29","keywords":"rape,19th century,murder,revenge,female protagonist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4241931289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiOGNlYmYtOTA0NC00ZDI4LTg1MjgtNWIyMzg3MWVmOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiOGNlYmYtOTA0NC00ZDI4LTg1MjgtNWIyMzg3MWVmOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young woman in 1800's Australia seeks vengeance for horrific acts committed against her family."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4957233/","name":"Aisling Franciosi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4650436/","name":"Michael Sheasby"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11583458/","name":"Maya Christie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448768/","name":"Jennifer Kent"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0375200/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0634932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175594/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448768/","name":"Jennifer Kent"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The writing is superb and I'm almost salivating as I eagerly await the DVD set of the second season. I thoroughly enjoyed the 4-disc DVD set of the entire first season and will usurp sole possession of TV remote on June 12, 2007 so that my hubby won't be able to interrupt my sweet fix of watching my new favorite TV star in this season's debut episode.\n\nHere's to Kyra Sedgwick's Emmy for her stellar, spellbinding, hilarious, adorable portrayal of TV's newest heroine, Brenda Lee Johnson.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24215,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-06-13","keywords":"strong female character,21st century,fbi federal bureau of investigation,criminal investigation,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001718/","name":"Kyra Sedgwick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

The show in and of itself is nothing to write home about, a basic pairing of mixed gender characters with a love/hate relationship (that will more than likely veer into a romantic direction- let us all pray not) who want to avoid admitting the obvious fact that they work well together and are made for each other. This has been done repeatedly and frankly beat over viewers heads when mixed with the typical cop, CSI drama.

I feel the show is a refreshing break from the dark, high-paced, slapstick comedy, reality hungry barrage of television we've been reduced to. It's clean, it's funny, it's cultural and it's light. That deserves a well done in my book! Personal hopes for the show: they keep Villa's and Rosie's relationship friendly. They bring back Nicole Ari Parker as his love interest (that was a lame excuse for a break up!), they continue to advance the cases they work on to be more interesting.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7405,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2015-09-23","keywords":"laboratory,pathologist,deduction,heart condition,miami florida","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004820/","name":"Morris Chestnut"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1632786/","name":"Jaina Lee Ortiz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827488/","name":"Gabrielle Dennis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069651/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0555624/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1029960/","name":"Todd Harthan"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3235099417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2MDc5ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1NzQ1NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2MDc5ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1NzQ1NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official trailer for Rosewood on Fox."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

They bring back Nicole Ari Parker as his love interest (that was a lame excuse for a break up!), they continue to advance the cases they work on to be more interesting.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7405,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2015-09-23","keywords":"laboratory,pathologist,deduction,heart condition,miami florida","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004820/","name":"Morris Chestnut","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1632786/","name":"Jaina Lee Ortiz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827488/","name":"Gabrielle Dennis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069651/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0555624/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1029960/","name":"Todd Harthan"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3235099417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2MDc5ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1NzQ1NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2MDc5ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1NzQ1NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official trailer for Rosewood on Fox."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I loved seeing Morris Chesnut in a role where he really shines. The fact that he's gorgeous is not relative to his character, an overly optimistic, happy-go-lucky pain in Villa's butt.I didn't feel like that was overly played, some viewers Posed his character as cocky because he mentions himself in quirky ways, but it's actually a play on his sarcastic comedy. The show in and of itself is nothing to write home about, a basic pairing of mixed gender characters with a love/hate relationship (that will more than likely veer into a romantic direction- let us all pray not) who want to avoid admitting the obvious fact that they work well together and are made for each other. This has been done repeatedly and frankly beat over viewers heads when mixed with the typical cop, CSI drama. However, the mixture of Villa and Rosie's characters are nice and their acting both together and individually is growing on me with every episode.I love the positive family atmosphere and feel that all the supporting actors do well with each other and at holding their own.

Sherlock Holmes bivši je savjetnik Scotland Yarda, koji zbog svoje ovisnosti o drogama kreće prema New Yorku kako bi se liječio u centru za odvikavanje od opijata. Genij logičnog zaključivanja odluči ostati u New Yorku kada shvati da grad obiluje zločinima i zanimljivim zagonetnim slučajevima. Zabrinut za sina, Sherlockov otac šalje Joan Watson uspješnu kirurginju kako bi pazila na njega i držala ga dalje od iskušenja i poroka. I nakon isteka ugovora, Joan ostaje živjeti s Holmesom, koji joj ponudi posao asistentice, priznavši koliko mu znače njezina pomoć, prisutnost i sabranost. U lovu na zločince, Holmesu se pridružuju Thomas "Toby" Gregson, kapetan njujorške policije, koji je i sam nekoć bio član Scotland Yarda, dijela odjela za borbu protiv terorizma. Dvojica starih poznanika, koji se međusobno cijene, ponovno se susreću u New Yorku. U istragama im pomaže i detektiv Marcus Bell, Gregsonov asistent, koji se u početku protivi Holmesovom uplitanju u rješavanje slučajeva, no ubrzo shvati da bi se bez Holmesove pomoći kriminalci vjerojatno izvukli.</desc>

Heartbreaking aftermath. Beautiful love story. Powerful history lesson. All in one. Worth every tear.","reviewBody":"I want to start by saying that I did not find The Nightingale excessively violent. And believe me, I hate movie violence. But I feel like I've seen trailers for action flicks that had more. Plenty of TV shows do as well. Maybe not rape, but still. Perhaps the reason it didn't feel excessive was because the movie doesn't dwell on it. It avoids gore, except in a few places where it really was necessary. Not only is there absolutely nothing gratuitous, each of those scenes has in it so much more than just "oh, look, they kill", "oh, look, they rape." For example, both women who are raped are mothers. Both are torn away from their very young children in the process. So, not only are they brutally violated, I was horrified thinking what must have been going through their minds knowing that the children are out there, helpless, crying, and they can't protect them.\n\nAt the center of the story is an Irish convict named Clare (Aisling Franciosi) and an aboriginal man named Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) whom she convinces to guide her through the wilderness to the men lead by Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin) who "took something from her". But it is nowhere near a simple revenge story.\n\nThe film offers a history lesson that might be more affecting than anything with names and dates. It's a sharp and clear look at what violence does to people, not just the victims, but the perpetrators too. It's easy to see what happened there earlier. White people take the land, the aboriginals fight them, soldiers brought in to fight them, the aboriginals fight back, and it spiraled on and on turning the whole place into the land of "bad spirits" that we find in the film. We see people that are dead, even if their bodies are still alive. The white woman holding a baby while looking at her burning house. An older aboriginal tracker forced to witness horrific violence against one of his own and then keep guiding the very perpetrators. A convict who saw two others killed right in front of him - tellingly one by an aboriginal and another by an officer.\n\nThe soldiers, who are there not exactly on their own free will, are taught to dehumanize the locals as well as the convicts they are guarding. We can see the beginnings of the process in the young officer and in the convict boy Hawkins takes a brief interest in. We can see how it's kill or be killed, quite possibly by one of your own. But by dehumanizing the others they are dehumanizing themselves eventually becoming like Hawkins and his hapless sidekick Ruse (Damon Herriman). The film doesn't let anyone off the hook. There's a heartbreaking scene that reminds us that even settlers who are nice and kind and, what we would now call, woke are still living on the stolen land.\n\nClare is an orphan who found herself having to steal to survive which landed her in that hell hole of a place as a young girl. Now 21 she finally has things starting to look up for her. A husband, a little hut, a beautiful baby girl. Life. Hope. But her long earned freedom is in the hands of Hawkins who is mildly infatuated with her and wants to keep her for himself. When her husband's ill conceived attempt to break her free brings on a horrible tragedy, she too is pulled into the vortex of violence. And Billy, who is trying to keep his head down and avoid trouble in spite of having suffered enormously from the colonizers, is pulled in along with her. But it is their relationship that holds them and the film together. Watching it move slowly from an understandable distrust to a deep bond melts your heart. To me it's really a love story.\n\nI found the film pulling me in like few have ever done. It was as if I was there, feeling what the characters were feeling as much as it can be possible sitting in my comfortable 21st century chair. I wasn't just grieving for them, I was grieving with them, a few times finding myself breaking down literally seconds before one of them did. This has never happened to me before. I think it's because everything flows so organically. Every mood change, every action, dream, nightmare is right in its place and palpably real. No small feat for something that is also rich with allegory. And the acting is fantastic across the board. Franciosi's performance is raw and alive, like a pulsating vein as she goes through a myriad of subtle changes of emotions. Layers of emotions. Clare never loses her vulnerability, no matter how much rage she is in or how much confidence she is trying to project. That's what makes her so compelling. Ganambarr is a revelation as Billy. He moves seamlessly, with barely a change of tone between being an occasional comic relief, talking about his culture with quiet, yet forceful passion, and revealing just how much he's been hurt, and he is perfect every step of the way. You can see the pain buried inside him slowly seeping out as the movie progresses. And Hawkins could have been a run of the mill villain, but Claflin fleshes him out as someone who commits violence not out of strength, but out of weakness. He is unable to control anything, from soldiers under his command to his own career. Impotent both figuratively and literally, he kills and rapes as a means of control.

 --- Description: The Nightingale: Directed by Jennifer Kent. With Aisling Franciosi, Michael Sheasby, Maya Christie, Addison Christie. Set in 1825, Clare, a young Irish convict woman, chases a British officer through the rugged Tasmanian wilderness, bent on revenge for a terrible act of violence he committed against her family.

Heartbreaking aftermath. Beautiful love story. Powerful history lesson. All in one. Worth every tear.","reviewBody":"I want to start by saying that I did not find The Nightingale excessively violent. And believe me, I hate movie violence. But I feel like I've seen trailers for action flicks that had more. Plenty of TV shows do as well. Maybe not rape, but still. Perhaps the reason it didn't feel excessive was because the movie doesn't dwell on it. It avoids gore, except in a few places where it really was necessary. Not only is there absolutely nothing gratuitous, each of those scenes has in it so much more than just "oh, look, they kill", "oh, look, they rape." For example, both women who are raped are mothers. Both are torn away from their very young children in the process. So, not only are they brutally violated, I was horrified thinking what must have been going through their minds knowing that the children are out there, helpless, crying, and they can't protect them.\n\nAt the center of the story is an Irish convict named Clare (Aisling Franciosi) and an aboriginal man named Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) whom she convinces to guide her through the wilderness to the men lead by Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin) who "took something from her". But it is nowhere near a simple revenge story.\n\nThe film offers a history lesson that might be more affecting than anything with names and dates. It's a sharp and clear look at what violence does to people, not just the victims, but the perpetrators too. It's easy to see what happened there earlier. White people take the land, the aboriginals fight them, soldiers brought in to fight them, the aboriginals fight back, and it spiraled on and on turning the whole place into the land of "bad spirits" that we find in the film. We see people that are dead, even if their bodies are still alive. The white woman holding a baby while looking at her burning house. An older aboriginal tracker forced to witness horrific violence against one of his own and then keep guiding the very perpetrators. A convict who saw two others killed right in front of him - tellingly one by an aboriginal and another by an officer.\n\nThe soldiers, who are there not exactly on their own free will, are taught to dehumanize the locals as well as the convicts they are guarding. We can see the beginnings of the process in the young officer and in the convict boy Hawkins takes a brief interest in. We can see how it's kill or be killed, quite possibly by one of your own. But by dehumanizing the others they are dehumanizing themselves eventually becoming like Hawkins and his hapless sidekick Ruse (Damon Herriman). The film doesn't let anyone off the hook. There's a heartbreaking scene that reminds us that even settlers who are nice and kind and, what we would now call, woke are still living on the stolen land.\n\nClare is an orphan who found herself having to steal to survive which landed her in that hell hole of a place as a young girl. Now 21 she finally has things starting to look up for her. A husband, a little hut, a beautiful baby girl. Life. Hope. But her long earned freedom is in the hands of Hawkins who is mildly infatuated with her and wants to keep her for himself. When her husband's ill conceived attempt to break her free brings on a horrible tragedy, she too is pulled into the vortex of violence. And Billy, who is trying to keep his head down and avoid trouble in spite of having suffered enormously from the colonizers, is pulled in along with her. But it is their relationship that holds them and the film together. Watching it move slowly from an understandable distrust to a deep bond melts your heart. To me it's really a love story.\n\nI found the film pulling me in like few have ever done. It was as if I was there, feeling what the characters were feeling as much as it can be possible sitting in my comfortable 21st century chair. I wasn't just grieving for them, I was grieving with them, a few times finding myself breaking down literally seconds before one of them did. This has never happened to me before. I think it's because everything flows so organically. Every mood change, every action, dream, nightmare is right in its place and palpably real. No small feat for something that is also rich with allegory. And the acting is fantastic across the board. Franciosi's performance is raw and alive, like a pulsating vein as she goes through a myriad of subtle changes of emotions. Layers of emotions. Clare never loses her vulnerability, no matter how much rage she is in or how much confidence she is trying to project. That's what makes her so compelling. Ganambarr is a revelation as Billy. He moves seamlessly, with barely a change of tone between being an occasional comic relief, talking about his culture with quiet, yet forceful passion, and revealing just how much he's been hurt, and he is perfect every step of the way. You can see the pain buried inside him slowly seeping out as the movie progresses. And Hawkins could have been a run of the mill villain, but Claflin fleshes him out as someone who commits violence not out of strength, but out of weakness. He is unable to control anything, from soldiers under his command to his own career. Impotent both figuratively and literally, he kills and rapes as a means of control. He doesn't enjoy sex or anything else for that matter. A miserable creature, even more disgusting than he is scary - perfectly befitting someone in the last stages of inner decay.\n\nThe film loses its momentum for a bit towards the end, but just barely. I found it a riveting, breathtaking, mesmerizing watch, well worth my every tear.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25065,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-29","keywords":"rape,19th century,murder,revenge,female protagonist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4241931289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiOGNlYmYtOTA0NC00ZDI4LTg1MjgtNWIyMzg3MWVmOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiOGNlYmYtOTA0NC00ZDI4LTg1MjgtNWIyMzg3MWVmOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young woman in 1800's Australia seeks vengeance for horrific acts committed against her family.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4957233/","name":"Aisling Franciosi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4650436/","name":"Michael Sheasby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11583458/","name":"Maya Christie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448768/","name":"Jennifer Kent"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0375200/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0634932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175594/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448768/","name":"Jennifer Kent"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Heartbreaking aftermath. Beautiful love story. Powerful history lesson. All in one. Worth every tear.","reviewBody":"I want to start by saying that I did not find The Nightingale excessively violent. And believe me, I hate movie violence. But I feel like I've seen trailers for action flicks that had more. Plenty of TV shows do as well. Maybe not rape, but still. Perhaps the reason it didn't feel excessive was because the movie doesn't dwell on it. It avoids gore, except in a few places where it really was necessary. Not only is there absolutely nothing gratuitous, each of those scenes has in it so much more than just "oh, look, they kill", "oh, look, they rape." For example, both women who are raped are mothers. Both are torn away from their very young children in the process. So, not only are they brutally violated, I was horrified thinking what must have been going through their minds knowing that the children are out there, helpless, crying, and they can't protect them.\n\nAt the center of the story is an Irish convict named Clare (Aisling Franciosi) and an aboriginal man named Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) whom she convinces to guide her through the wilderness to the men lead by Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin) who "took something from her". But it is nowhere near a simple revenge story.\n\nThe film offers a history lesson that might be more affecting than anything with names and dates. It's a sharp and clear look at what violence does to people, not just the victims, but the perpetrators too. It's easy to see what happened there earlier. White people take the land, the aboriginals fight them, soldiers brought in to fight them, the aboriginals fight back, and it spiraled on and on turning the whole place into the land of "bad spirits" that we find in the film. We see people that are dead, even if their bodies are still alive. The white woman holding a baby while looking at her burning house. An older aboriginal tracker forced to witness horrific violence against one of his own and then keep guiding the very perpetrators. A convict who saw two others killed right in front of him - tellingly one by an aboriginal and another by an officer.\n\nThe soldiers, who are there not exactly on their own free will, are taught to dehumanize the locals as well as the convicts they are guarding. We can see the beginnings of the process in the young officer and in the convict boy Hawkins takes a brief interest in. We can see how it's kill or be killed, quite possibly by one of your own. But by dehumanizing the others they are dehumanizing themselves eventually becoming like Hawkins and his hapless sidekick Ruse (Damon Herriman). The film doesn't let anyone off the hook. There's a heartbreaking scene that reminds us that even settlers who are nice and kind and, what we would now call, woke are still living on the stolen land.\n\nClare is an orphan who found herself having to steal to survive which landed her in that hell hole of a place as a young girl. Now 21 she finally has things starting to look up for her. A husband, a little hut, a beautiful baby girl. Life. Hope. But her long earned freedom is in the hands of Hawkins who is mildly infatuated with her and wants to keep her for himself. When her husband's ill conceived attempt to break her free brings on a horrible tragedy, she too is pulled into the vortex of violence. And Billy, who is trying to keep his head down and avoid trouble in spite of having suffered enormously from the colonizers, is pulled in along with her. But it is their relationship that holds them and the film together. Watching it move slowly from an understandable distrust to a deep bond melts your heart. To me it's really a love story.\n\nI found the film pulling me in like few have ever done. It was as if I was there, feeling what the characters were feeling as much as it can be possible sitting in my comfortable 21st century chair. I wasn't just grieving for them, I was grieving with them, a few times finding myself breaking down literally seconds before one of them did. This has never happened to me before. I think it's because everything flows so organically. Every mood change, every action, dream, nightmare is right in its place and palpably real. No small feat for something that is also rich with allegory. And the acting is fantastic across the board. Franciosi's performance is raw and alive, like a pulsating vein as she goes through a myriad of subtle changes of emotions. Layers of emotions. Clare never loses her vulnerability, no matter how much rage she is in or how much confidence she is trying to project. That's what makes her so compelling. Ganambarr is a revelation as Billy. He moves seamlessly, with barely a change of tone between being an occasional comic relief, talking about his culture with quiet, yet forceful passion, and revealing just how much he's been hurt, and he is perfect every step of the way. You can see the pain buried inside him slowly seeping out as the movie progresses. And Hawkins could have been a run of the mill villain, but Claflin fleshes him out as someone who commits violence not out of strength, but out of weakness. He is unable to control anything, from soldiers under his command to his own career. Impotent both figuratively and literally, he kills and rapes as a means of control. He doesn't enjoy sex or anything else for that matter. A miserable creature, even more disgusting than he is scary - perfectly befitting someone in the last stages of inner decay.\n\nThe film loses its momentum for a bit towards the end, but just barely. I found it a riveting, breathtaking, mesmerizing watch, well worth my every tear.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25065,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-29","keywords":"rape,19th century,murder,revenge,female protagonist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4241931289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiOGNlYmYtOTA0NC00ZDI4LTg1MjgtNWIyMzg3MWVmOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiOGNlYmYtOTA0NC00ZDI4LTg1MjgtNWIyMzg3MWVmOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young woman in 1800's Australia seeks vengeance for horrific acts committed against her family."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4957233/","name":"Aisling Franciosi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4650436/","name":"Michael Sheasby"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11583458/","name":"Maya Christie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448768/","name":"Jennifer Kent"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0375200/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0634932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175594/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448768/","name":"Jennifer Kent"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He moves seamlessly, with barely a change of tone between being an occasional comic relief, talking about his culture with quiet, yet forceful passion, and revealing just how much he's been hurt, and he is perfect every step of the way. You can see the pain buried inside him slowly seeping out as the movie progresses. And Hawkins could have been a run of the mill villain, but Claflin fleshes him out as someone who commits violence not out of strength, but out of weakness. He is unable to control anything, from soldiers under his command to his own career. Impotent both figuratively and literally, he kills and rapes as a means of control. He doesn't enjoy sex or anything else for that matter. A miserable creature, even more disgusting than he is scary - perfectly befitting someone in the last stages of inner decay.\n\nThe film loses its momentum for a bit towards the end, but just barely. I found it a riveting, breathtaking, mesmerizing watch, well worth my every tear.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25065,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-29","keywords":"rape,19th century,murder,revenge,female protagonist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4241931289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiOGNlYmYtOTA0NC00ZDI4LTg1MjgtNWIyMzg3MWVmOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiOGNlYmYtOTA0NC00ZDI4LTg1MjgtNWIyMzg3MWVmOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young woman in 1800's Australia seeks vengeance for horrific acts committed against her family.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4957233/","name":"Aisling Franciosi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4650436/","name":"Michael Sheasby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11583458/","name":"Maya Christie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448768/","name":"Jennifer Kent"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0375200/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0634932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175594/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448768/","name":"Jennifer Kent"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The show in and of itself is nothing to write home about, a basic pairing of mixed gender characters with a love/hate relationship (that will more than likely veer into a romantic direction- let us all pray not) who want to avoid admitting the obvious fact that they work well together and are made for each other.

That deserves a well done in my book! Personal hopes for the show: they keep Villa's and Rosie's relationship friendly.

What a gem of a movie. The Guest tells a tale of a mysterious and initially benign-appearing ex-military man who claims to have served with the recently deceased son of the Peterson family. Still grieving their loss, they welcome him with open arms. All is not as it seems however and slowly, despite his psychopathic charm, young Anna Peterson suspects that something is amiss.\n\nWhat follows is a slick and stylish thriller with fluid action scenes that simmers at first before leading us to an explosive finale. The acting is solid throughout, especially from the two leads Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe who share a nice chemistry. The story, whilst simplistic and sometimes cheesy, is tight and the terse dialogue fits well. Character motivations are deliberately left vague and the film remains focused on the fact it is a thriller and doesn't overburden us with ridiculous a back-story; what back-story there is merely serves as a plot device to set-up the finale. And what a finale! Without giving spoilers, it is one of the most stylish final movie set-pieces I've seen in a long time, interjected with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek quips. Just shows what can be done with the right set, some nerves and a smoke machine; who needs CGI!\n\nA special mention must be given to the excellent soundtrack which really enhances the tension in some of the key scenes. At times I swore the bass beats were synced with my heart-rate!\n\nHighly enjoyable and highly recommended!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96349,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-05","keywords":"psychopath,ex soldier,killing spree,bullying,grief","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2685905945","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMTk0ODk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMTk0ODk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A soldier introduces himself to the Peterson family, claiming to be a friend of their son who died in action.

What a gem of a movie. The Guest tells a tale of a mysterious and initially benign-appearing ex-military man who claims to have served with the recently deceased son of the Peterson family. Still grieving their loss, they welcome him with open arms. All is not as it seems however and slowly, despite his psychopathic charm, young Anna Peterson suspects that something is amiss.\n\nWhat follows is a slick and stylish thriller with fluid action scenes that simmers at first before leading us to an explosive finale. The acting is solid throughout, especially from the two leads Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe who share a nice chemistry. The story, whilst simplistic and sometimes cheesy, is tight and the terse dialogue fits well. Character motivations are deliberately left vague and the film remains focused on the fact it is a thriller and doesn't overburden us with ridiculous a back-story; what back-story there is merely serves as a plot device to set-up the finale. And what a finale! Without giving spoilers, it is one of the most stylish final movie set-pieces I've seen in a long time, interjected with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek quips. Just shows what can be done with the right set, some nerves and a smoke machine; who needs CGI!\n\nA special mention must be given to the excellent soundtrack which really enhances the tension in some of the key scenes. At times I swore the bass beats were synced with my heart-rate!\n\nHighly enjoyable and highly recommended!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96349,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-05","keywords":"psychopath,ex soldier,killing spree,bullying,grief","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2685905945","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMTk0ODk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMTk0ODk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A soldier introduces himself to the Peterson family, claiming to be a friend of their son who died in action.

Viewers immediately fell in love with Grant Gustin's Barry Allen (AKA The Flash). The first season was amazing and enjoyable, and the story was very complex, yet felt smooth and even.\n\nWell, how the mighty have fallen. Over the seasons, we see a decrease in quality. As the producers churn out more and more episodes, the drop in quality is apparent. This is especially so in Season 4, which is by far the worst season of the flash. The excitement has all but faded, as each episode repeats the same things over and over again, with the plot being extremely predictable. \n\nIt is my hope that the main villain was given more time and that the number of episodes could be decreased, to reduce the number of filler episodes and to end up with a more concise story, that is better told.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":325341,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-10-07","keywords":"superhuman speed,dc arrowverse,superhero,dc comics,based on comic","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2652716/","name":"Grant Gustin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2765384/","name":"Candice Patton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1263939/","name":"Danielle Panabaker"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330789/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075528/","name":"Greg Berlanti"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424315/","name":"Geoff Johns"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1132610/","name":"Andrew Kreisberg"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 7 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3478176025","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2MxMDdhNWQtZGM2OC00MTI1LTgxMjItMmQ4Y2YwYzc1MjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2MxMDdhNWQtZGM2OC00MTI1LTgxMjItMmQ4Y2YwYzc1MjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on characters from DC's The Flash.

Viewers immediately fell in love with Grant Gustin's Barry Allen (AKA The Flash). The first season was amazing and enjoyable, and the story was very complex, yet felt smooth and even.\n\nWell, how the mighty have fallen. Over the seasons, we see a decrease in quality. As the producers churn out more and more episodes, the drop in quality is apparent. This is especially so in Season 4, which is by far the worst season of the flash. The excitement has all but faded, as each episode repeats the same things over and over again, with the plot being extremely predictable. \n\nIt is my hope that the main villain was given more time and that the number of episodes could be decreased, to reduce the number of filler episodes and to end up with a more concise story, that is better told.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":325341,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-10-07","keywords":"superhuman speed,dc arrowverse,superhero,dc comics,based on comic","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2652716/","name":"Grant Gustin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2765384/","name":"Candice Patton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1263939/","name":"Danielle Panabaker"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330789/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075528/","name":"Greg Berlanti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424315/","name":"Geoff Johns","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1132610/","name":"Andrew Kreisberg"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 7 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3478176025","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2MxMDdhNWQtZGM2OC00MTI1LTgxMjItMmQ4Y2YwYzc1MjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2MxMDdhNWQtZGM2OC00MTI1LTgxMjItMmQ4Y2YwYzc1MjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on characters from DC's The Flash.

Viewers immediately fell in love with Grant Gustin's Barry Allen (AKA The Flash). The first season was amazing and enjoyable, and the story was very complex, yet felt smooth and even.\n\nWell, how the mighty have fallen. Over the seasons, we see a decrease in quality. As the producers churn out more and more episodes, the drop in quality is apparent. This is especially so in Season 4, which is by far the worst season of the flash. The excitement has all but faded, as each episode repeats the same things over and over again, with the plot being extremely predictable. \n\nIt is my hope that the main villain was given more time and that the number of episodes could be decreased, to reduce the number of filler episodes and to end up with a more concise story, that is better told.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":325341,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-10-07","keywords":"superhuman speed,dc arrowverse,superhero,dc comics,based on comic","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2652716/","name":"Grant Gustin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2765384/","name":"Candice Patton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1263939/","name":"Danielle Panabaker"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330789/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075528/","name":"Greg Berlanti"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424315/","name":"Geoff Johns"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1132610/","name":"Andrew Kreisberg"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 7 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3478176025","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2MxMDdhNWQtZGM2OC00MTI1LTgxMjItMmQ4Y2YwYzc1MjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2MxMDdhNWQtZGM2OC00MTI1LTgxMjItMmQ4Y2YwYzc1MjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on characters from DC's The Flash.

Viewers immediately fell in love with Grant Gustin's Barry Allen (AKA The Flash). The first season was amazing and enjoyable, and the story was very complex, yet felt smooth and even.\n\nWell, how the mighty have fallen. Over the seasons, we see a decrease in quality. As the producers churn out more and more episodes, the drop in quality is apparent. This is especially so in Season 4, which is by far the worst season of the flash. The excitement has all but faded, as each episode repeats the same things over and over again, with the plot being extremely predictable. \n\nIt is my hope that the main villain was given more time and that the number of episodes could be decreased, to reduce the number of filler episodes and to end up with a more concise story, that is better told.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":325341,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-10-07","keywords":"superhuman speed,dc arrowverse,superhero,dc comics,based on comic","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2652716/","name":"Grant Gustin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2765384/","name":"Candice Patton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1263939/","name":"Danielle Panabaker"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330789/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075528/","name":"Greg Berlanti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424315/","name":"Geoff Johns","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1132610/","name":"Andrew Kreisberg"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 7 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3478176025","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2MxMDdhNWQtZGM2OC00MTI1LTgxMjItMmQ4Y2YwYzc1MjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2MxMDdhNWQtZGM2OC00MTI1LTgxMjItMmQ4Y2YwYzc1MjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on characters from DC's The Flash.

What a gem of a movie. The Guest tells a tale of a mysterious and initially benign-appearing ex-military man who claims to have served with the recently deceased son of the Peterson family. Still grieving their loss, they welcome him with open arms. All is not as it seems however and slowly, despite his psychopathic charm, young Anna Peterson suspects that something is amiss.\n\nWhat follows is a slick and stylish thriller with fluid action scenes that simmers at first before leading us to an explosive finale. The acting is solid throughout, especially from the two leads Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe who share a nice chemistry. The story, whilst simplistic and sometimes cheesy, is tight and the terse dialogue fits well. Character motivations are deliberately left vague and the film remains focused on the fact it is a thriller and doesn't overburden us with ridiculous a back-story; what back-story there is merely serves as a plot device to set-up the finale.

U 8. sezoni serije, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) i Penny (Kaley Cuoco) odlučili su okruniti svoju vezu brakom nakon nekoliko nespretnih prekida u prošlosti. Čak je i Sheldon (Jim Parsons) pronašao družicu te je sklopio "ugovor o vezi" s neurobiologinjom Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), koja ipak traži pauzu jer joj smeta spori napredak njihove veze. Dok Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) pomaže Howardu (Simon Helberg) da se pomiri sa smrću njegove majke, sramežljivi Raj (Kunal Nayyar) nastavlja svoju dosad najdugovječniju vezu s Emily (Laura Spencer).</desc>

At times I swore the bass beats were synced with my heart-rate!\n\nHighly enjoyable and highly recommended!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96349,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-05","keywords":"psychopath,ex soldier,killing spree,bullying,grief","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2685905945","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMTk0ODk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMTk0ODk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A soldier introduces himself to the Peterson family, claiming to be a friend of their son who died in action.

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"reunited friends,funeral,old friends reunited,ash scattering,pregnant wife","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"reunited friends,funeral,old friends reunited,ash scattering,pregnant wife","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée.

Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny.

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is.

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"reunited friends,funeral,old friends reunited,ash scattering,pregnant wife","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential.

The music and dance performances of the movie are par excellence. All the dances are so fun to watch but Obviously the End Dance wins it all, it was Super Fantastic. The only thing Step up 3D lacked big time is its acting department, obviously all them can dance exceptionally well but their acting was quite poor except for Adam G.Sevani Aka. Moss and Alyson Stoner Aka. Cam. Adam and Alyson has prior acting experience so they were great along with their dancing. Adam and Alyson's road dance was one of the sweetest dance performance I've ever seen. Stunning looking Sharni Vinson danced really well and in some scenes she acted quite well. Gorgeous Boy Rick Malambri was the weakest Actor and Dancer among them all. His dancing with Sharni Vinson was great but in whole group he was the weakest link. Sadly, he had no expressions on his face whether he is serious, sad, happy or funny, he had the same expressions except when he Smiles. I think he got this job because of his looks because he is a terrible actor. One thing besides his good looks saved him was his awesome chemistry with Sharni Vinson. All the other dancers were great in dancing and terrible in acting. Overall its highly enjoyable because of its Incredible dance routines so, if we forget the terrible acting by most of them, its pretty good.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":56991,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-08-06","keywords":"3d,3 dimensional,competition,bed,false identity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Step Up 3D: Promo Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2734556697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjMyNzIyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjMyNzIyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A tight-knit group of New York City street dancers, including Luke (Malambri) and Natalie (Vinson), team up with NYU freshman Moose (Sevani), and find themselves pitted against the world's best hip hop dancers in a high-stakes showdown that will change their lives forever.

The music and dance performances of the movie are par excellence. All the dances are so fun to watch but Obviously the End Dance wins it all, it was Super Fantastic. The only thing Step up 3D lacked big time is its acting department, obviously all them can dance exceptionally well but their acting was quite poor except for Adam G.Sevani Aka. Moss and Alyson Stoner Aka. Cam. Adam and Alyson has prior acting experience so they were great along with their dancing. Adam and Alyson's road dance was one of the sweetest dance performance I've ever seen. Stunning looking Sharni Vinson danced really well and in some scenes she acted quite well. Gorgeous Boy Rick Malambri was the weakest Actor and Dancer among them all. His dancing with Sharni Vinson was great but in whole group he was the weakest link. Sadly, he had no expressions on his face whether he is serious, sad, happy or funny, he had the same expressions except when he Smiles. I think he got this job because of his looks because he is a terrible actor. One thing besides his good looks saved him was his awesome chemistry with Sharni Vinson. All the other dancers were great in dancing and terrible in acting. Overall its highly enjoyable because of its Incredible dance routines so, if we forget the terrible acting by most of them, its pretty good.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":56991,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-08-06","keywords":"3d,3 dimensional,competition,bed,false identity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Step Up 3D: Promo Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2734556697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjMyNzIyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjMyNzIyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A tight-knit group of New York City street dancers, including Luke (Malambri) and Natalie (Vinson), team up with NYU freshman Moose (Sevani), and find themselves pitted against the world's best hip hop dancers in a high-stakes showdown that will change their lives forever.

The Renaissance was over, their loyal target audience was in college and thus not interested, Pixar was doing the whole CGI thing way better than them and all in all they seemed to have lost their touch. Until this film. Oh sure, it's still very much like something Pixar would have done and a bit missing on that Disney magic, but it's still a very good film that allowed them to get back on their feet.\n\nAnd when I say it's something Pixar would have done, I mean that in a good way. Kind of. The plot features a dog, raised to believe he has genuine superpowers, suddenly being separated from his loyal owner Penny and now having to make his way back across USA to reunite with her. All the while having to learn that the world does not in fact play by his rules. Sounds like a Pixar movie, doesn't it. But then again, Pixar is a great film studio so that's not exactly an insult.\n\nAnd the story and the characters are very good in their own right. Bolt, the eponymous main character, is very gruff and no-nonsense, but also delightfully naïve about the realities of the world, while Mittens, his new cat sidekick/helper/kidnap victim is pretty much the exact opposite. And then there is Rhino, a hamster trapped in a plastic ball and also one of Bolt's biggest fans.

The Renaissance was over, their loyal target audience was in college and thus not interested, Pixar was doing the whole CGI thing way better than them and all in all they seemed to have lost their touch. Until this film. Oh sure, it's still very much like something Pixar would have done and a bit missing on that Disney magic, but it's still a very good film that allowed them to get back on their feet.\n\nAnd when I say it's something Pixar would have done, I mean that in a good way. Kind of. The plot features a dog, raised to believe he has genuine superpowers, suddenly being separated from his loyal owner Penny and now having to make his way back across USA to reunite with her. All the while having to learn that the world does not in fact play by his rules. Sounds like a Pixar movie, doesn't it. But then again, Pixar is a great film studio so that's not exactly an insult.\n\nAnd the story and the characters are very good in their own right. Bolt, the eponymous main character, is very gruff and no-nonsense, but also delightfully naïve about the realities of the world, while Mittens, his new cat sidekick/helper/kidnap victim is pretty much the exact opposite. And then there is Rhino, a hamster trapped in a plastic ball and also one of Bolt's biggest fans. Rhino is awesome.\n\nAnd yeah, it's kind of silly that I keep complaining about the fact that it's so much a Pixar film. It does make it seem a bit artificial in a way, because you know that they're copying much of their good material. But it's a good film, when all is said and done.

It is also about an epiphany for Ben Stone and changing of his ways internally.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35076,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1991-08-02","keywords":"small town,skinny dipping,doctor,hospital,community service","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Doc Hollywood","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3976509977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmNhYzM5YjgtZThhMS00NGRjLThkM2QtNDM4ZmUxYTU3NDM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmNhYzM5YjgtZThhMS00NGRjLThkM2QtNDM4ZmUxYTU3NDM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000150/","name":"Michael J.

While the two movies are about as similar as Dr. No is to GoldenEye (thankfully), I suppose comparisons between one non-stop adventure film and other are inevitable. In the end, what really counts when determining a film's quality is the level to which it can entertain. And if there is one thing The Mummy did well, it was entertain. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo were very well chosen for their roles.\n\nThe Mummy Returns is easy to see as being another sequel churned out to satiate the greedy money-machine that Hollywood has become, but it has a few things working for it. One thing that is immediately obvious is that the sequel was very much intended to be a film that could be enjoyed without ever having seen the original. The only references to the previous film are done to fill in the narrative gaps about who Imhotep is, and why he is the way he is. The addition of The Scorpion King was an interesting effort to give the film a new antagonist, but the lack of screentime didn't work well in this tangent's favour. Another tangent that could have been better developed was the rivalry between Imhotep's girlfriend and whatever her name was. Imhotep originally mistook Rachel Weisz's character for being his girlfriend reincarnated, so the use of a woman who looks exactly like her while creating this new tangent needed to be developed differently.\n\nMost people won't give a damn about complex story tangents and will want to know if this film is entertaining.

While the two movies are about as similar as Dr. No is to GoldenEye (thankfully), I suppose comparisons between one non-stop adventure film and other are inevitable. In the end, what really counts when determining a film's quality is the level to which it can entertain. And if there is one thing The Mummy did well, it was entertain. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo were very well chosen for their roles.\n\nThe Mummy Returns is easy to see as being another sequel churned out to satiate the greedy money-machine that Hollywood has become, but it has a few things working for it. One thing that is immediately obvious is that the sequel was very much intended to be a film that could be enjoyed without ever having seen the original. The only references to the previous film are done to fill in the narrative gaps about who Imhotep is, and why he is the way he is. The addition of The Scorpion King was an interesting effort to give the film a new antagonist, but the lack of screentime didn't work well in this tangent's favour. Another tangent that could have been better developed was the rivalry between Imhotep's girlfriend and whatever her name was. Imhotep originally mistook Rachel Weisz's character for being his girlfriend reincarnated, so the use of a woman who looks exactly like her while creating this new tangent needed to be developed differently.\n\nMost people won't give a damn about complex story tangents and will want to know if this film is entertaining. And it is entertaining, alright. There is barely a dull moment in the film's substantial running length, and Oded Fehr does a bang-up job of providing a Mad-Max-cum-Indiana-Jones hero. I want to know where they get those groovy costumes and tattoos from, they look quite nice. Anyway, when all is said and done, this is an eight out of ten film.

It's more like a revival, or a nostalgic time trip. Except that it's all been updated nicely, with a feeling of the original sassiness intact. And the Isaac Hayes music is central, and terrific, making this a legit Shaft movie. \n\nSamuel Jackson plays the role perfectly, not pulling back and not overdoing it. The idea of a black cop in a city that still has racial biases, in this case emphasizing the rise of Latino drug lords as part of the fracturing, is mainstreamed here. It's not as daring or shocking to see this pushed forward, but it's still effective. Shaft, the main character (who never seems to have a first name), is powerful, smart, and unwilling to be pushed around by authority.

It's more like a revival, or a nostalgic time trip. Except that it's all been updated nicely, with a feeling of the original sassiness intact. And the Isaac Hayes music is central, and terrific, making this a legit Shaft movie. \n\nSamuel Jackson plays the role perfectly, not pulling back and not overdoing it. The idea of a black cop in a city that still has racial biases, in this case emphasizing the rise of Latino drug lords as part of the fracturing, is mainstreamed here. It's not as daring or shocking to see this pushed forward, but it's still effective. Shaft, the main character (who never seems to have a first name), is powerful, smart, and unwilling to be pushed around by authority. Even if it means losing his job (or quitting--Shaft is always the one making his own choices). \n\nThe director, John Singleton, is not especially well positioned for a mainstream sequel with high production values (his one famous effort to date is "Boyz n the Hood"), but he pulls it off.

Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact?

Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Most people seem to have deemed it as "one of the best animated movies of the decade" back in 2014. I'm not messing around though when I say that I wholeheartedly think that The LEGO Movie IS the best animated movie of the decade! To this day, I view it as the most unexpectedly "awesome" movie I've ever witnessed in my entire life. So as prophesied, I was pleading for this sequel to live up to its predecessor-despite disliking the watery trailers/teaser trailers/teaser teaser trailers/whatever configuration of a trailer I left out-and not bail-out like Hollywood's most popular, trivial, hop-scotch prequel/sequel/spinoff cash grabs.\n\nFor the first half of this movie, I can't lie, I was getting a tad concerned that this movie was going to suffer from major sequelitis due to its awfully turbo, too-meta-for-it's-own-good formula-that might I add, has become quite established already since we've seen this recipe fabricated more productively in three other LEGO movies. This mundane scheme appeared to be leading this movie off into oblivion. But, once the film gets kicking, it GETS kicking. The nucleus of this film starts to reveal itself as an emulate of the original LEGO Movie, thanks to its deftly kiddie-like version of a Christopher Nolan screenplay.\n\nThe Second Part decides to traverse off into another domain of family morals that sharply resonates as another clever parallel between the real world and the LEGO world that had me, by fair means, moved. Additionally, there are boatloads of themes that are acutely wholesome-although, slightly trite-that kids can blissfully digest.

Most people seem to have deemed it as "one of the best animated movies of the decade" back in 2014. I'm not messing around though when I say that I wholeheartedly think that The LEGO Movie IS the best animated movie of the decade! To this day, I view it as the most unexpectedly "awesome" movie I've ever witnessed in my entire life. So as prophesied, I was pleading for this sequel to live up to its predecessor-despite disliking the watery trailers/teaser trailers/teaser teaser trailers/whatever configuration of a trailer I left out-and not bail-out like Hollywood's most popular, trivial, hop-scotch prequel/sequel/spinoff cash grabs.\n\nFor the first half of this movie, I can't lie, I was getting a tad concerned that this movie was going to suffer from major sequelitis due to its awfully turbo, too-meta-for-it's-own-good formula-that might I add, has become quite established already since we've seen this recipe fabricated more productively in three other LEGO movies. This mundane scheme appeared to be leading this movie off into oblivion. But, once the film gets kicking, it GETS kicking. The nucleus of this film starts to reveal itself as an emulate of the original LEGO Movie, thanks to its deftly kiddie-like version of a Christopher Nolan screenplay.\n\nThe Second Part decides to traverse off into another domain of family morals that sharply resonates as another clever parallel between the real world and the LEGO world that had me, by fair means, moved. Additionally, there are boatloads of themes that are acutely wholesome-although, slightly trite-that kids can blissfully digest. Also, there are some good, good twists in here which ultimately, sustains the LCU's (LEGO Cinematic Universe's) streak of surprises.\n\nYes, it's not quite as authoritative or proficient as the original but, gosh-darn it, I can't deny that I was meticulously spellbinded by this rib-tickling sequel.

Yes.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future.

A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn't accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something. Kubrick used Keir Dullea in "2001: A Space Odyssey", yes, Keir Dullea, or as Noel Coward put it, Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow. We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she, one way or another, will land safely. She's terrific, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't as worried about her as I should have been. The last problem was the score. Why? A standard horror/action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there. I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department. Now, putting all that aside, director Alfonso Cuaron must be applauded and I strongly recommend you to run and see it in the biggest screen you can find and in 3D.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":790644,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,long take","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn't accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something. Kubrick used Keir Dullea in "2001: A Space Odyssey", yes, Keir Dullea, or as Noel Coward put it, Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow. We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she, one way or another, will land safely. She's terrific, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't as worried about her as I should have been. The last problem was the score. Why? A standard horror/action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there. I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department. Now, putting all that aside, director Alfonso Cuaron must be applauded and I strongly recommend you to run and see it in the biggest screen you can find and in 3D.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":790644,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,long take","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Yes.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways.

Yes.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future. Hopefully I can better describe the feeling it gives me when I do.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn't accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something. Kubrick used Keir Dullea in "2001: A Space Odyssey", yes, Keir Dullea, or as Noel Coward put it, Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow. We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she, one way or another, will land safely. She's terrific, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't as worried about her as I should have been. The last problem was the score. Why? A standard horror/action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there. I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department. Now, putting all that aside, director Alfonso Cuaron must be applauded and I strongly recommend you to run and see it in the biggest screen you can find and in 3D.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":790644,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,long take","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn't accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something. Kubrick used Keir Dullea in "2001: A Space Odyssey", yes, Keir Dullea, or as Noel Coward put it, Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow. We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she, one way or another, will land safely. She's terrific, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't as worried about her as I should have been. The last problem was the score. Why? A standard horror/action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there. I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department. Now, putting all that aside, director Alfonso Cuaron must be applauded and I strongly recommend you to run and see it in the biggest screen you can find and in 3D.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":790644,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,long take","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is a very honest representation of a man suffering with grief and alcoholism.\n\nHowever, it suffers from being a retread of many other similar movies.

    <title lang="hr">Wallace i Gromit: Pitanje kruha i života</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Wallace i njegov pas Gromit započeli su potpuno novi posao - pekarnicu "Top Bun". No postoji jedan problem - ostali lokalni pekari u gradu nestaju jedan po jedan... Je li Wallace sljedeći na redu? Wallace i Gromit započeli su novi posao pečenja kruha, "Top Bun", i pretvorili svoju kuću u Ulici West Wallaby 62 u žitnicu s peći, robotskim rukama za miješenje i staromodnom vjetrenjačom na krovu. Transformacija je savršena. Iako posao cvjeta, Gromit je zabrinut zbog vijesti da je desetak lokalnih pekara "nestalo" ove godine - ali Wallace se ne brine. On je previše rastresen i zaljubljen u bivšu ljepoticu i krušnu entuzijasticu, Piellu Bakewell. Dok oni uživaju, Gromit ubrzo shvaća da je život njegova gospodara u opasnosti te postaje detektiv kako bi riješio misteriozni slučaj u onome što ubrzo postaje "pitanje kruha i života".</desc>

I don't know what people could dislike about this movie. To me it was entertaining, with quite a lot of suspense once you're into the story, a good cast (even the kids), and it's all nicely shot. I understand everybody was suspicious of the Stasi at that time, your best friend could betray you, but in this case I think they exaggerated a bit in order to make it more suspensful. But the suspense was the good thing about the story, plus the fact that it's based on a true story which made it even more appealing. It's one of the better German movies I've seen lately, certainly worth a watch if you like escape movies.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-09-27","keywords":"east germany,year 1979,berlin germany,1970s,based on true story","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1694023449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFmMGU3NTMtZjdkMC00ZjI5LWJmZTQtYWY4NGM2MTYwNmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFmMGU3NTMtZjdkMC00ZjI5LWJmZTQtYWY4NGM2MTYwNmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3177935/","name":"Friedrich Mücke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0775858/","name":"Karoline Schuch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1269088/","name":"David Kross"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378660/","name":"Michael Herbig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108386/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027692/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0394219/","name":"Kit Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0973731/","name":"Thilo Röscheisen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378660/","name":"Michael Herbig"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I don't know what people could dislike about this movie. To me it was entertaining, with quite a lot of suspense once you're into the story, a good cast (even the kids), and it's all nicely shot. I understand everybody was suspicious of the Stasi at that time, your best friend could betray you, but in this case I think they exaggerated a bit in order to make it more suspensful. But the suspense was the good thing about the story, plus the fact that it's based on a true story which made it even more appealing. It's one of the better German movies I've seen lately, certainly worth a watch if you like escape movies.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-09-27","keywords":"east germany,year 1979,berlin germany,1970s,based on true story","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1694023449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFmMGU3NTMtZjdkMC00ZjI5LWJmZTQtYWY4NGM2MTYwNmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFmMGU3NTMtZjdkMC00ZjI5LWJmZTQtYWY4NGM2MTYwNmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3177935/","name":"Friedrich Mücke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0775858/","name":"Karoline Schuch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1269088/","name":"David Kross"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378660/","name":"Michael Herbig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108386/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027692/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0394219/","name":"Kit Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0973731/","name":"Thilo Röscheisen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378660/","name":"Michael Herbig"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I tremendously respected and appreciated the ties in this movie to the elements that make Star Trek great - strong story line, deep connection to the characters and a philosophical element. In some of the older Star Trek episodes the moral/philosophical element can be oppressively heavy handed. No so in the new Trek movie. The ideas of friendship, family and humanity are woven through this movie with subtly and I will outright admit I more than teared up during the climactic scene in the engine room. EVEN though I had already figured out what was going to happen, I have already come to care about, respect and enjoy the new actors in their iconic roles.\n\nSo yes, ten out of ten. And let the haters, hate. Those who can not embrace change can go sit and watch old Star Trek reruns and bemoan the 'good old days' and spout off all the reasons why 'Star Trek ain't what it used to be'!!!! \n\nI, on the other hand, will boldly go and embrace the new with a continued reverence for the old.

In some of the older Star Trek episodes the moral/philosophical element can be oppressively heavy handed. No so in the new Trek movie. The ideas of friendship, family and humanity are woven through this movie with subtly and I will outright admit I more than teared up during the climactic scene in the engine room. EVEN though I had already figured out what was going to happen, I have already come to care about, respect and enjoy the new actors in their iconic roles.\n\nSo yes, ten out of ten. And let the haters, hate. Those who can not embrace change can go sit and watch old Star Trek reruns and bemoan the 'good old days' and spout off all the reasons why 'Star Trek ain't what it used to be'!!!! \n\nI, on the other hand, will boldly go and embrace the new with a continued reverence for the old. This movie makes it possible to love both.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":471745,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-05-15","keywords":"sequel to a reboot,star trek,human female,adult daughter,james t. kirk character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blu-ray Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi410167577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNDU4MjI0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY1NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNDU4MjI0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY1NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"New on Blu-ray: After the crew of the Enterprise find an unstoppable force of terror from within their own organization, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0704270/","name":"Zachary Quinto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757855/","name":"Zoe Saldana"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009190/","name":"J.J.

Sinister mystery of Hogwarts.","reviewBody":""... The magical power that came to Joan Rowling from a different world, pulls for itself, and the book is read in one breath." Book Review, December 18, 2000\n\nThe second book about the adventures of the young wizard Harry Potter world waited impatiently. And finally, he waited. "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" appears before the reader's eyes with a bright and original work. Of course, it relies on the first book, but it remains individual. "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - a darker and more terrible book, unlike the first. So became the film. But the film and the book have not lost their charm and easy immediacy. It's still the same kind of fairy tale about the fight between good and evil, where good will certainly win.\n\nThe magical world of Harry Potter has not changed. All the same oblique streets of London, the splendor of Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest with its secret inhabitants, The slanting alley, the eerie Lute Lane, the unfriendly Rattling Willow, the huge school yard, the stunning quidditch. All this was preserved and was moved by magic wave in the second film, only slightly transformed. Hogwarts is a bright and active participant in all events. This castle, which became home for Harry, is no less important character than our young hero. Hogwarts carries in itself tying knowledge and great wisdom. This huge, majestic building knew a lot in its time. And all its secrets, its architecture and attract the eye.\n\nIn "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" we meet the amazing and frightening creatures of the magical world. Dobby's elf is very cute and funny. In such a small, frail body is hidden a wide soul, suffering in vain. He does his best to protect Harry from danger. But Harry Potter, like a magnet, attracts them. Favorite animal Hagrid turns into an unpleasant monster - a giant giant spider Aragog. He is wise, old, but does not inspire confidence. And on top of everything, the mighty, dangerous serpent Basilisk appears on the screen. There are many legends about this snake, and Joan Rowling decided to add it to her epic. And, in principle, not in vain. He inspires reverence and horror, but at the same time a frank desire for Harry to finish him off quickly. Another amazing character in the film is Phoenix Fawkes. Amazing bird flown from the pages of the book to the screen. She is an ancient mythical creature, dying and rising from the ashes. It reminds us of the eternal cycle of life and death. Special effects in the film, in other ways, as in the first, not at altitude. But even seeing a few implausible spiders and a snake, you believe everything that is happening on the screen. The magical, mysterious, magical and frankly amazing world of Harry Potter draws and you just do not want to return to reality. Chris Columbus, who became the director of the Potters for the second time, could not lose the charm and atmosphere of the first film. Just the movie "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" became more sinister, frightening and full of dangers.\n\nCharacters have not changed. Bright, alive, emotionally embodied on the screen of their heroes magnificent English actors. The cold and tough Potions master Severus Snegg performed by Alan Rickman, the same adamant Minerva McGonagall, the wise director of the Hogwarts School Albus Dumbledore (the eternal memory of Richard Harris, who died three weeks before the premiere of the film), the kind-hearted forester Hagrid. Pleased with new characters. Lucius Malfoy performed by Jason Isaacs is cruel, adamant. It just blows something negative and extremely unpleasant. Zlatopust Lokons is the life-builder, reclining on the laurels of others. He turned out to be too sugary, pretty, I would even say sugary. And, undoubtedly, the actor Kenneth Bran is on top. His character, or rather his performance, is very ironic. The unchanged trio of the main characters remained the same. Harry Potter is the star of the magical world, the orphan boy, who grew up in disgusting muggles, displays remarkable courage, desperation and determination. The one with which courage he rushes into battle, you can just envy. I'm torn by internal contradictions, his similarity with Lord Voldemort, his knowledge of the snake tongue. He is afraid of all this. And Harry desperately tries to understand himself. But when you need to become a hero, he is ready for this, because he is a hero in the full sense of the word. He is ready to give his own life for others. Is this not the highest manifestation of heroism? But Harry does not boast of it. And this is a huge plus to his character.\n\n"I'm sure that Mr. Potter will always be there to save us." - "Certainly." Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter.\n\nRon Weasley remained absolutely the same except for the character. He transformed, becoming better. His behavior towards Hermione, when she was insulted by Draco, calling her a Mudblood, his courage in the Forbidden Forest among not one hundred spiders, whom he fears until his death, causes respect and approval.\n\nHermione Granger is still the same smart girl with a lively mind and a great intellect. She is very natural and sincerely wants to help others. With her character there are certain metamorphoses. Hermione clearly ceases to be such an avid guardian of order.\n\n"We are badly influenced by it." Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Tom Narvolo Reddle is the past of the cruelest magician of the magical world of Lord Volan de Mort. This character is interesting with his striking resemblance to Harry. They are like halves of one whole. Harry has collected all the good and positive, in Voldemort everything is bad and negative. They are very similar, but they are very different. The choice. That's what makes Harry the way he is and distinguishes him from a dark magician. Choosing Harry to live the life he wants. His choice.\n\n"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - a magical, mysterious, full of magic, amazing and terrible creatures canvas director Chris Columbus. For the second time we stepped into this unique world full of mysteries and terrible discoveries. Music, Gothic entourage, Hogwarts and unchanging heroes in the fight against evil: welcome to the magical world of Harry Potter, created by the hand of a fabulous storyteller Joan Rowling.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":580877,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"invisibility cloak,sequel,wizard,basilisk,killing a monster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1705771289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

He is afraid of all this. And Harry desperately tries to understand himself. But when you need to become a hero, he is ready for this, because he is a hero in the full sense of the word. He is ready to give his own life for others. Is this not the highest manifestation of heroism? But Harry does not boast of it. And this is a huge plus to his character.\n\n"I'm sure that Mr. Potter will always be there to save us." - "Certainly." Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter.\n\nRon Weasley remained absolutely the same except for the character. He transformed, becoming better. His behavior towards Hermione, when she was insulted by Draco, calling her a Mudblood, his courage in the Forbidden Forest among not one hundred spiders, whom he fears until his death, causes respect and approval.\n\nHermione Granger is still the same smart girl with a lively mind and a great intellect. She is very natural and sincerely wants to help others. With her character there are certain metamorphoses. Hermione clearly ceases to be such an avid guardian of order.\n\n"We are badly influenced by it." Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Tom Narvolo Reddle is the past of the cruelest magician of the magical world of Lord Volan de Mort. This character is interesting with his striking resemblance to Harry. They are like halves of one whole. Harry has collected all the good and positive, in Voldemort everything is bad and negative. They are very similar, but they are very different. The choice. That's what makes Harry the way he is and distinguishes him from a dark magician. Choosing Harry to live the life he wants. His choice.\n\n"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - a magical, mysterious, full of magic, amazing and terrible creatures canvas director Chris Columbus. For the second time we stepped into this unique world full of mysteries and terrible discoveries. Music, Gothic entourage, Hogwarts and unchanging heroes in the fight against evil: welcome to the magical world of Harry Potter, created by the hand of a fabulous storyteller Joan Rowling.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":580877,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"invisibility cloak,sequel,wizard,basilisk,killing a monster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1705771289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

Serija "Na tuđem kauču", koju je osmislio i u kojoj glumi komičar Pete Holmes, vraća se na HBO s trećom sezonom. Serija je nadahnuta Holmesovim osobnim iskustvima kao komičara te pruža suptilan i urnebesan pogled u današnje stanje komedije. U ovoj je sezoni Pete pun energije te više ne spava na tuđim kaučima i ponovno ulazi u svijet njujorške stand-up komedije. No iako se poboljšao, to ne znači da je glavna faca u gradu. Dok nastavlja kružiti oko komičarke i bivše cure Ali, povezuje se s Kat koja ima jedinstven pogled na svijet komedije i ne pokušava se proslaviti pričanjem viceva. Pete je svakim nastupom sve bliže uspjehu te nastavlja usklađivati vjeru i izlaske i navigirati kroz stalno mijenjajuću komičarsku scenu.</desc>

The photography was beautiful, the acting excellent, and the supporting players added an extra "punch" to the story line. Tho not an exact replica of the book it is based more on a story line running thru Crowe's and Marion's characters. The emphasis being on Crowe's character finding out what is truly meaningful in his very hectic super-charged rather non ethical life. He rediscovers what he is missing i.e. love, trust, and friendships.\n\nA "Great" date movie. The local scenery should definitely be seen on the "big" screen and not on a DVD! Tho not "Oscar" caliber" it is why most film goers go to the movies; pure entertainment and escapism. Ridley and Crowe have achieved that goal.

The photography was beautiful, the acting excellent, and the supporting players added an extra "punch" to the story line. Tho not an exact replica of the book it is based more on a story line running thru Crowe's and Marion's characters. The emphasis being on Crowe's character finding out what is truly meaningful in his very hectic super-charged rather non ethical life. He rediscovers what he is missing i.e. love, trust, and friendships.\n\nA "Great" date movie. The local scenery should definitely be seen on the "big" screen and not on a DVD! Tho not "Oscar" caliber" it is why most film goers go to the movies; pure entertainment and escapism. Ridley and Crowe have achieved that goal.

Serija "Na tuđem kauču", koju je osmislio i u kojoj glumi komičar Pete Holmes, vraća se na HBO s trećom sezonom. Serija je nadahnuta Holmesovim osobnim iskustvima kao komičara te pruža suptilan i urnebesan pogled u današnje stanje komedije. U ovoj je sezoni Pete pun energije te više ne spava na tuđim kaučima i ponovno ulazi u svijet njujorške stand-up komedije. No iako se poboljšao, to ne znači da je glavna faca u gradu. Dok nastavlja kružiti oko komičarke i bivše cure Ali, povezuje se s Kat koja ima jedinstven pogled na svijet komedije i ne pokušava se proslaviti pričanjem viceva. Pete je svakim nastupom sve bliže uspjehu te nastavlja usklađivati vjeru i izlaske i navigirati kroz stalno mijenjajuću komičarsku scenu.</desc>

I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.\n\nCoco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie?

I hope that it will last more than one season. However, because I like it means it probably wont last. you will have to watch it for yourself. It has been better than watching re-runs on the traditional channels which aren't worth watching. The characters are very interesting and I wonder who is on the 'bad' side for the series.

I suggest you watch it and go with the flow, you won't regret it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35886,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Mystery","Romance","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-09-26","keywords":"airplane crash,survivor,explosion,afterlife,doctor patient relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Passengers: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3525836825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDQ0Njk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2OTkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDQ0Njk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2OTkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Passengers, directed by Rodrigo GarcÃ­a.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933940/","name":"Patrick Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001556/","name":"David Morse"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006554/","name":"Rodrigo García"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142446/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0123049/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159892/","name":"Ronnie Christensen"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is also a little bit like Fringe. However there is no time travel or alternative universes in this yet.

I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.\n\nOne issue I had with Lee's 2003 film was the slow-pacing; the film felt as if it dragged forever between action scenes. It wasn't necessarily the fault of the cast, but seemed more to do with a story that didn't really grab me. Letterier's film amps up the excitement and interest levels a bit with a stronger story and better action sequences. The Hulk's fight against three gamma-irradiated dogs in the previous film doesn't even compare to the Hulk's battle against the Army on the college campus in this film. I didn't see the Hulk from 2003 as being overly-cartoonish in appearance but I can see how some others did. The new film gives the Hulk a grittier, stronger, more realistic style (as realistic as a 9-foot tall green giant can be) and the Abomination looks just as good.\n\nIn general, I also dug the new cast better than the previous. Ed Norton was great as Bruce Banner, giving him a great blend of meekness and inner strength. From what I understand, Norton is a huge fan of the source material so you know he must've given this role everything he had. I enjoyed Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, though there were times when I missed Jennifer Connelly, and Tim Roth has long been one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him go with the villainous side this time around as Blonsky. William Hurt was a fine General Ross though, just as Liv Tyler, there were times when I thought Sam Elliot would've put in a stronger performance (plus, there were a handful of instances where Hurt came off as over-acting a bit, in my opinion...).\n\nIt's great to have the character of the Hulk back in the hands of Marvel and they've done a great job of rejuvenating the franchise. I loved this film and, while it wasn't on par with 2008's Iron Man film, it was a great superhero flick. The action was brutal, the story was entertaining, and the cast was near perfect. My only real issue with the film was the ending; without going into detail, I thought the resolution of the final battle between the Hulk and Abomination was anti-climactic. I remember first watching the scene and the only thought that popped into my head was "That's IT?!". Otherwise, it's a great movie and a good way to spend two hours.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":455162,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2008-06-18","keywords":"marvel cinematic universe,based on comic,bruce banner character,reboot of series,scene during opening credits","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Incredible Hulk: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1726152985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second trailer for The Incredible Hulk, directed by Louis Leterrier."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000239/","name":"Liv Tyler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504642/","name":"Louis Leterrier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672015/","name":"Zak Penn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456158/","name":"Jack Kirby"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

TV needs more shows like Buffy and Lost Girl and iZombie and Jessica Jones, and Wynonna Earp hits the sweet spot of being darkish but with humor and strong bonds between characters.\n\nI'm looking forward to the third episode and beyond.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21360,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-04-01","keywords":"based on comic,lesbian,lesbian relationship,idw comics,wyatt earp","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1234276/","name":"Melanie Scrofano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0747653/","name":"Tim Rozon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3176450/","name":"Dominique Provost-Chalkley"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0202933/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wynonna Earp Season Two","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi16366361","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkZGM5ZWEtZTIwMy00NjUzLWI1MjktNDg4ZDQ3NzJmOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkZGM5ZWEtZTIwMy00NjUzLWI1MjktNDg4ZDQ3NzJmOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Everyone has demons, but hers are real."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I felt a little mislead from the commercials. It seemed as if I was going to be watching actual footage that people video taped. However, it's just re-enactments as far as the first episode goes. The first story in the episode was decent. The second story was much better even though it was shorter. I enjoyed the way the people who it happened to told the story. Unlike Discovery's version of this genre the people show emotion. They pause and you can tell they are genuinely scared just by retelling the story. It kind of gives you a feeling of those late nights you spend with friends when people start talking about weird things that have happened to them. So I enjoyed the personal feeling of the show. Overall, the show is not new in it's idea. For the genre though it is pretty good. Hopefully, they do bring in some type of real footage!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2575,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"genre":["Documentary","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2011-09-07","keywords":"haunting,poltergeist,two word title,eyewitness account,documentary series","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7025791/","name":"Gillian English"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3266807/","name":"Frances Townend"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3141457/","name":"Daniel Cannis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0178419/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Paranormal Witness","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3941252377","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVkMWY4N2YtM2Y2Zi00OGRiLTkwNDUtOWIxZWM4ZDdkMGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVkMWY4N2YtM2Y2Zi00OGRiLTkwNDUtOWIxZWM4ZDdkMGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Paranormal Witness"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>
