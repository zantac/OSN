If you are going to tear it apart for every little thing, then I suggest you look elsewhere. - MERK","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34359,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Mystery","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1996-05-31","keywords":"african american boy,black hole bomb,investigation,mexico,alien","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Arrival","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1988690201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJjNzBhZWMtMGU4Zi00NzYzLWE2ODItYjE2ODcxNDM5MTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJjNzBhZWMtMGU4Zi00NzYzLWE2ODItYjE2ODcxNDM5MTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000221/","name":"Charlie Sheen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001080/","name":"Lindsay Crouse","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878638/","name":"David Twohy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068503/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022915/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878638/","name":"David Twohy"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's a shame so many people watched something so cheap when there are many better movies out there.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-21","keywords":"female full frontal nudity,bare breasts,female pubic hair,panties pulled down,female removes her clothes","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272399/","name":"Colin Ferguson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000319/","name":"Yancy Butler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593511/","name":"Kirsty Mitchell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0975225/","name":"Griff Furst"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0222021/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0320980/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080897/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3593780/","name":"David Reed"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

However, for those looking for intelligent theoretical sci-fi, I would look to the first, and watch it perhaps a second time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2002-08-29","keywords":"writing on skin,falling up,calculus equation,number 60659,introducing self","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0558182/","name":"Kari Matchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0943870/","name":"Geraint Wyn Davies","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0475129/","name":"Grace Lynn Kung"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0782900/","name":"Andrzej Sekula"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015569/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060306/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393517/","name":"Sean Hood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053228/","name":"Ernie Barbarash","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572369/","name":"Lauren McLaughlin"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sands is trying to control a coup by allowing it to happy but then having the victor killed as soon as he takes power.  However the involvement of drug lord Barillo and various other groups soon complicate matters causing bullets to come from all sides.\n\nAfter taking an unlikely trilogy to box office success, Rodriguez returns to the film series that basically brought him the success he has today  El Mariachi.  While the first film in the series was a very cheap movie, the second and the third swelled with budget and star names.  Here the action is constant and is very stylised.  This is not to say that it is all edge of the seat stuff, but if spectacle and bangs is all you are after then this should do the job nicely.  None of it moves slowly simply because it has more than enough going on to fill the time  but that's the problem to be honest.\n\nThe plot has so much going on but none of it actually fits together or makes a whole lot of sense.  After a while any attempt to put things together in my head became a wasted effort  clearly the point here was that the style and gloss was meant to be everything.  The other downside to this is that some characters are so poorly used that it's a wonder as to why they were even written in.  Some cameos are fantastic and make the film.  I refer to, of course, Depp, who, for the second time this summer, manages to make a film better by his sheer witty performance.  He owes a lot to the writing of the character but he carries him off superbly and is darkly funny.  However Rouke, Blades, Mendes, Dafoe all have little to do and, with some of them, are just clutter.  Banderas does his usual stuff with style but his character doesn't have the depth that the flashbacks I think are meant to give him  again this is style over substance.\n\nI still quite enjoyed the film but couldn't help but feel it was less the sum of it's parts.

The success is attributable partly to the comedic talents of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence -- who have the ability to deliver crude, rude dialog such that it's funny nevertheless -- and partly to a story that combines suspense and humor into a believable whole. \n\n Our two heroes are police detectives Mike Lowry (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence), who are a kind of tough-cop variation on The Odd Couple . Lowry is suave, slick, self-controlled, well-to-do, heroic, and a real ladies man.  Burnett, on the other hand, is an ordinary guy who manages to stumble reasonably effectively, if somewhat ineptly, through his work and his married life.\n\nSo imagine what happens when Burnett has to convince a key witness, Julie (Téa Leoni) that he's Mike Lowry -- not just for a few hours, but for a few days.  Furthermore, this is no pre-planned, well-orchestrated masquerade.

The success is attributable partly to the comedic talents of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence -- who have the ability to deliver crude, rude dialog such that it's funny nevertheless -- and partly to a story that combines suspense and humor into a believable whole. \n\n Our two heroes are police detectives Mike Lowry (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence), who are a kind of tough-cop variation on The Odd Couple . Lowry is suave, slick, self-controlled, well-to-do, heroic, and a real ladies man.  Burnett, on the other hand, is an ordinary guy who manages to stumble reasonably effectively, if somewhat ineptly, through his work and his married life.\n\nSo imagine what happens when Burnett has to convince a key witness, Julie (Téa Leoni) that he's Mike Lowry -- not just for a few hours, but for a few days.  Furthermore, this is no pre-planned, well-orchestrated masquerade.  A large stash of confiscated heroin has been un-confiscated right from police headquarters, and both the heroin and the perpetrator must be found within four days, or Internal Affairs is going to take some big-time disciplinary action.  Lowry and Burnett are called in because they were the ones who captured the heroin in the first place, and because of the one trait they share -- a renegade approach to police work, which may not have their boss's approval, but which does get the job done (and at one point, causes a store owner to think they're out to rob him).  The various twists and turns of the investigation lead to Lowry getting knocked out of commission at the same time that Julie witnesses a murder and refuses to deal with anybody but Mike Lowry.  But Marcus Burnett is the only one available to deal with her, and since waiting for Lowry to recover isn't an option   \n\nSubsequent events include Lowry's bachelor pad being invaded by Julie and her dogs, while Lowry stays with Burnett's wife, Burnett trying to keep his wife from finding out what's really going on, and Burnett and Lowry trying to find the heroin and keep Julie alive. \n\nFor all you action movie fans, plenty of cars, plenty of buildings, and plenty of people get blown up along the way.  (Looking over this review, I see that I've belied the high level of violence, which I definitely should warn you against.)\n\nBAD BOYS kept me both amused and on the edge of my seat throughout.  I'm afraid I did have two small complaints, however.  First, I wish the resolution of the Burnett-pretending-to-be-Lowry  story had been timed to coincide with the resolution of the main plot. \n\nAs it is, the comic subplot ends, leaving the rest of the movie to proceed in a rather formulaic and pedantic fashion.  Second, I wish more time had been spent on Lowry's problem of stepping into Burnett's shoes.  The swinging bachelor having to play family man would have been good for a few laughs that we never got.\n\nAside from that, however, this is an action movie that stands out among the rest.\n\nOne final note concerning the DVD "Special Edition" release.

Korak po korak, uklopit će se u tim a njezine kolege, u početku jako pridržane, postaju joj najbolji prijatelji.</desc>

Nakon što je Nolan uspio uvjeriti jednu ženu da ne počini samoubojstvo, Jackson se nađe na udaru kritike jer nije koristio vatreno oružje kada se činilo da je morao, no Lopez ga štiti. Nolan i Bishop uhite ovisnicu zbog posjedovanja droge, ali doznaju da je nožem u svađi ubila tinejdžericu, koja je preminula. Chen je zaglavila s novom osobom za obuku, dok se Tim opravlja i zafrkava uhićenog zbog krađe. Nolan i dalje ima problem jer balansira između onoga što osjeća kao civil i kako bi se trebao ponašati kao policajac.</desc>

I forgot how much fun and how very funny a film it was. Having grown up watching some of William Castle's and Roger Corman's hokey but very entertaining early horror films it was like a stroll down memory lane on my Saturday's. Goodman captured the essence of a movie showman who always had or wanted to have a gimmick to go with his B movie pictures. Cathy Moriarty is excellent as his favorite leading lady. I must be showing my age because I still remember the duck and cover and other little things associated with everyday life and times during the late 1950's and early 1960's that were in the movie. The movie was entertaining and a very nice parody, if not dedication to the men who made B movies as part of our culture. I have to believe this dedication to men like Corman and Castle would have to be a bit of a tongue in cheek parody for it to be a very sincere dedication. The movie does an excellent job of bring back the life and times and the performances as pretty good. Aaaahhhh the memories. The cold war and much simpler times and classic B movies. It don't get any better than this."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10492,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1993-01-29","keywords":"film within a film,movie theater,cuban missile crisis,b movie,mother son relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Matinee","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4204265753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU3YTcyZWMtZjBiYi00NWY1LWJkZmUtYjEzNjNkMmNhZmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU3YTcyZWMtZjBiYi00NWY1LWJkZmUtYjEzNjNkMmNhZmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"text os"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000422/","name":"John Goodman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001550/","name":"Cathy Moriarty"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272086/","name":"Simon Fenton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001102/","name":"Joe Dante"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051415/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0421948/","name":"Jerico Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0351919/","name":"Charles S.

I forgot how much fun and how very funny a film it was. Having grown up watching some of William Castle's and Roger Corman's hokey but very entertaining early horror films it was like a stroll down memory lane on my Saturday's. Goodman captured the essence of a movie showman who always had or wanted to have a gimmick to go with his B movie pictures. Cathy Moriarty is excellent as his favorite leading lady. I must be showing my age because I still remember the duck and cover and other little things associated with everyday life and times during the late 1950's and early 1960's that were in the movie. The movie was entertaining and a very nice parody, if not dedication to the men who made B movies as part of our culture. I have to believe this dedication to men like Corman and Castle would have to be a bit of a tongue in cheek parody for it to be a very sincere dedication. The movie does an excellent job of bring back the life and times and the performances as pretty good. Aaaahhhh the memories. The cold war and much simpler times and classic B movies. It don't get any better than this.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10492,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1993-01-29","keywords":"film within a film,movie theater,cuban missile crisis,b movie,mother son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Matinee","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4204265753","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU3YTcyZWMtZjBiYi00NWY1LWJkZmUtYjEzNjNkMmNhZmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU3YTcyZWMtZjBiYi00NWY1LWJkZmUtYjEzNjNkMmNhZmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"text os","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000422/","name":"John Goodman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001550/","name":"Cathy Moriarty","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272086/","name":"Simon Fenton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001102/","name":"Joe Dante"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051415/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0421948/","name":"Jerico Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0351919/","name":"Charles S.

Didn't happen folks; ain't in the Bible. But these fictional possibilities were woven together by Civil War general under his beech tree in Indiana, and in Sante Fe while he was governor of the New Mexico Territory where he offered amnesty to Billy the Kid, just like in Young Guns II. But when Lew Wallace presented his novel, BEN-HUR, to the world, it has not only been in print continuously, it has also inspired three films, at least; inspired President Garfield to appoint Wallace as Minister to the Ottoman Empire; gave its name to a sandwich sold in a diner in Crawfordville, IN, and also named a mutual burial insurance society, also in Crawfordsville.

I, too, believe that the Three Wise Men (whom I believe to be certain Roman notables, but I will not say who in this forum) arrived when Jesus was a toddler. But, shucks, Lew Wallace puts them in Bethlehem shortly after Jesus' birth, and two major films put them right next to the shepherds who also visited the stable---just like in the nativity figurines we purchase the day after Thanksgiving from better department stores. Not Biblically accurate---nope---but they still broadcast Charlton Heston as Ben Hur at Easter time. The same latitude should be granted to this movie. The Young Messiah film deserves to inherit the latitude established for it by its predecessors---Lew Wallace, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Henryk Sienkiewicz, and even Par Lagerkvist. El Greco painted a crucifixion scene, but the city depicted behind Christ on the Cross was not Jerusalem but Toledo in Spain---now that's latitude---and it is considered a priceless masterpiece.\n\nWhen I was a Junior in High School, my A. P. literature class was expected to read all of John Milton's epic poem, Paradise Lost, in three weeks. I wondered how such a long poem could be derived from such a slender account in the Biblical book of Genesis. Then I found out how: John Milton, with that great organ-like iambic pentameter, used some latitude; a whole lot of latitude, to create a magnificent poetic masterpiece.

I am only an amateur in film appreciation, although a published poet elsewhere, and I found the photography beautiful, the dialogue convincing, and the portrait of Jesus poignant, winsome, and a little bit fun (not like reading Kazantzakis' Last Temptation Of Christ).

A very fine movie; at times, a very spiritual movie; and throughout, a very human movie.

It deserves as much respect as our inaccurate Nativity scenes that we put up on the mantle, above the Christmas stockings hanging there, on Thanksgiving afternoon, after Grandma's fine Turkey with all the fixin's.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3420,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-11","keywords":"israel,jesus christ character,1st century,messiah,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2382672665","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjM4NDI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NjU4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjM4NDI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ0NjU4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Jesus Christ at age seven as he and his family depart Egypt to return home to Nazareth.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6026206/","name":"Adam Greaves-Neal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909906/","name":"Vincent Walsh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3322537/","name":"Sara Lazzaro"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637493/","name":"Cyrus Nowrasteh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043365/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232424/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637492/","name":"Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0637493/","name":"Cyrus Nowrasteh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0723351/","name":"Anne Rice"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Who among us isn't intrigued by a real life "unsolved" murder mystery? Throw in a very wealthy New York real estate family, a never-discovered body, an executed friend, and a horrible childhood trauma and it is certain to draw the attention of filmmaker Andrew Jarecki. Jarecki's film "Capturing the Friedmans" won numerous awards and is among the best documentaries ever made. He has a knack with dark family secrets.\n\nIn the film, Ryan Gosling plays David Marks, disenchanted son of Real Estate mogul Sanford Marks (a powerful Frank Langella), who witnessed the grisly suicide of his mother when he was very young. David meets the energetic and affectionate Katie (Kirsten Dunst) and the two dreamers escape Daddy's clutches and head to Vermont to open a health food store. Finally wilting under pressure from Sanford, the couple returns to the city and David joins the family business. The good things are soon to end.\n\nSince much of the real life story is still a mystery, Jarecki does a nice job in assembling pieces from the trial records. Along the way, we meet David's friend Deborah Lehrman (Lilly Rabe), an acclaimed writer who seems to always be there for David ... as he is for her. We witness the transformation of David from loving husband to mentally disturbed murder suspect.\n\nJarecki gives us some guidance on what might have happened and how the plan could have been executed, but we'll never know for sure. What we do know is that there was not much happiness associated with this family, despite the wealth and 42nd Street real estate holdings.\n\nThe acting in the film is tremendous. Gosling, Dunst and Langella are top notch. Yes, Ms. Dunst provides what is easily her best screen performance ever. Support work from Lily Rabe, Phillip Baker Hall, Nick Offerman and Kristen Wiig is all strong and believable. This one will give you the creeps ... and rightly so.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54641,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-12-03","keywords":"murder,home movie footage,murder investigation,double life,sex scene","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"All Good Things","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4062157081","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg2NDAwNTYwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk3ODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg2NDAwNTYwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk3ODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A detective (Morgan) begins to unravel a missing-persons case that might spell doom for the heir to a New York real estate dynasty (Gosling), who fell for a young woman from the wrong side of the tracks (Dunst).

Who among us isn't intrigued by a real life "unsolved" murder mystery? Throw in a very wealthy New York real estate family, a never-discovered body, an executed friend, and a horrible childhood trauma and it is certain to draw the attention of filmmaker Andrew Jarecki. Jarecki's film "Capturing the Friedmans" won numerous awards and is among the best documentaries ever made. He has a knack with dark family secrets.\n\nIn the film, Ryan Gosling plays David Marks, disenchanted son of Real Estate mogul Sanford Marks (a powerful Frank Langella), who witnessed the grisly suicide of his mother when he was very young. David meets the energetic and affectionate Katie (Kirsten Dunst) and the two dreamers escape Daddy's clutches and head to Vermont to open a health food store. Finally wilting under pressure from Sanford, the couple returns to the city and David joins the family business. The good things are soon to end.\n\nSince much of the real life story is still a mystery, Jarecki does a nice job in assembling pieces from the trial records. Along the way, we meet David's friend Deborah Lehrman (Lilly Rabe), an acclaimed writer who seems to always be there for David ... as he is for her. We witness the transformation of David from loving husband to mentally disturbed murder suspect.\n\nJarecki gives us some guidance on what might have happened and how the plan could have been executed, but we'll never know for sure. What we do know is that there was not much happiness associated with this family, despite the wealth and 42nd Street real estate holdings.\n\nThe acting in the film is tremendous. Gosling, Dunst and Langella are top notch. Yes, Ms. Dunst provides what is easily her best screen performance ever. Support work from Lily Rabe, Phillip Baker Hall, Nick Offerman and Kristen Wiig is all strong and believable. This one will give you the creeps ... and rightly so.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54641,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-12-03","keywords":"murder,home movie footage,murder investigation,double life,sex scene","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"All Good Things","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4062157081","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg2NDAwNTYwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk3ODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg2NDAwNTYwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk3ODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A detective (Morgan) begins to unravel a missing-persons case that might spell doom for the heir to a New York real estate dynasty (Gosling), who fell for a young woman from the wrong side of the tracks (Dunst).

The movie progresses through Wilberforce's life from about the time he begins his crusade against the slave trade in Parliament in his early 20's to the time it is eventually abolished. Everything in between is composed of all the hardships, victories, and relationships he goes through in the meantime. At some points the story can be a bit yawn inducing, but the film consistently seems to add just the right amount of humor or political intrigue to keep it afloat (more on the pacing below). There is a love interest Barbara, played by the quite attractive and dynamic Romola Garai, who keeps Mr. Fantastic...err...Wilberforce on track and encouraged. You get the feeling he would've never made it through the hard times without her (which is probably the case for most successful men as they say). The film does delve into evils of the slave trade, but it doesn't focus specifically on it, much like Amistad did focus on it. It seems to keep the main goal in mind, abolishing that heinous evil. This gives the film a "glass half full" feeling instead of a "glass half empty" one. You find yourself cheering for the good guys instead of seeking the heads of the bad ones.\n\nYou may be thinking they should've just called this film "Amistad: The Prequel", but that would do it a great disservice. Where Amistad succeeded in many ways such as exposing the horror of the slave trade in much more visual and visceral detail and containing great acting by Djimon Hounsou and Anthony Hopkins, I feel you ultimately left the theater not really feeling much better about anything. In fact, I'd say you may have left if feeling worse, maybe even shameful and/or guilty. Amazing Grace doesn't feel like that. In fact, it's not even really a "feel good" movie; it transcends that status. It's really a "do good" movie. You almost feel personal empowerment from the story, like you want to go out and change some social injustice yourself! Sure, we don't all have the political clout of a William Wilberforce, but we do have a voice. And I think that's why Amazing Grace stands above previous "social injustice" films like it. It feels organic instead of static. It feels like it could apply to today instead of some time long forgotten. It also appeals to everyone; black, white, or whoever. One African-American in the audience mentioned how he was impressed and encouraged at how passionate these white men were for the plight of the slaves. You also realize that slavery wasn't just an American problem, it was a world problem; which further emphasized the fact that the social injustice we see today isn't just a "fill_in_the_blank" problem, it's a world problem.\n\nI'm not knowledgeable enough to comment very much on the technical aspects of this film, but don't let the religious overtones fool you into thinking this is another technical mess like so many in the past. It is on par with any period film of its kind from Hollywood in almost every way; acting, set design, costume design, story, etc. \n\nOne thing I found a drawback to it was its pacing though. It starts off fairly tepid, and though it builds up, it seems to go through a cycle of building up and then falling back down again. This could ultimately be a good thing though, because if you can keep your focus throughout the film, you'll be in for a very powerful ending that evokes positive emotions you didn't think you had, and I think the cyclic nature of the film's progress enhances the fulfillment the ending provides. I also found the time period jumping around within the film to be a bit confusing at some points; like some scenes I didn't know if they were in the past or present. \n\nThe representative at the screening said the movie would be playing on about 850 screens nationwide on its opening weekend (Feb. 23). Though this is small compared to most major movies, it is a pretty good amount for a smaller movie like this. I recommend going to see it if you're interested in a movie with depth, passion, character, goodness, virtue, and victory. Does it entertain? Sure. But it seems to do a little more also. You can't say that about too many movies these days. You won't leave wishing you had that $8.50 back. \n\nIn case you're wondering about the title, John Newton, the composer of the famous hymn 'Amazing Grace', (played powerfully by Albert Finney), was a contemporary and friend of William Wilberforce. John Newton was also a reformed ex-slave trader.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24466,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2007-02-23","keywords":"pregnancy,christian feminism,slave,slave trade,abolition","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Amazing Grace","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi330694937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzhmYjhjY2QtMTYxYS00MjdlLThhOGYtMGRjNWRiYjlkNzI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzhmYjhjY2QtMTYxYS00MjdlLThhOGYtMGRjNWRiYjlkNzI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0344435/","name":"Ioan Gruffudd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002091/","name":"Michael Gambon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000776/","name":"Michael Apted"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129170/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136728/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041459/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140275/","name":"Steven Knight"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's really funny. I was blown away by the cleverness and originality in this film. The first 40 minutes had me on the floor in hysterics- my only problem was that it unnecessarily evolved into a bad Austin Powers film in the final 20. This however, is one of the few films where the campy ending didn't make me dislike the rest of the film (which is normally the case). Everyone gives a great performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are some really great moments throughout.

I don't recommend seeing it though- it was poorly crafted and didn't pack any of the laughs or magic from the film. So those avoiding this film due to its lousy trailer should give this one a chance. It's really funny. I was blown away by the cleverness and originality in this film. The first 40 minutes had me on the floor in hysterics- my only problem was that it unnecessarily evolved into a bad Austin Powers film in the final 20. This however, is one of the few films where the campy ending didn't make me dislike the rest of the film (which is normally the case). Everyone gives a great performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are some really great moments throughout. I personally plan on seeing it again when it comes out- only to catch all the details which I was laughing over during the first viewing!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21849,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-06-13","keywords":"corporation,satire,reporter,assassin,pop star","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"War, Inc.: Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1591804185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMDQzNDE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4ODEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMDQzNDE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4ODEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for War, Inc., directed by Joshua Seftel.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000131/","name":"John Cusack","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000673/","name":"Marisa Tomei","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240381/","name":"Hilary Duff"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0781733/","name":"Joshua Seftel"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079035/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008725/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0191241/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2061096/","name":"Mark Leyner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683282/","name":"Jeremy Pikser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000131/","name":"John Cusack"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Until that premiered much was talked about, first Oscar buzz was all over this movie, people seemed to see Nicole Kidman as a lock for the Best Actress category and since it was directed by La Vie en Rose director Olivier Dahan and with a powerful producer like Harvey Weinstein backing the movie up, well it seemed like we could expect great things from it. This was until the movie was delayed from Cannes 2013 and the fights between the directors cut and Weinstein started, and well this went on for basically a whole year with the movie being postponed several times and with a lot of controversy on top of it as well. The movie finally premiered at Cannes 2014, it was the opening movie and the directors cut was shown and the Weinstein name doesn't even appear on screen when the movie starts. The reviews bashed the movie, many said that it was unforgettable because it was the worst Cannes opener they had ever seen. And although the movie has only been released for about a month, everybody seems to have already forgotten it, well i still had interest in seeing it, i mean how bad could it actually be?\n\nGrace of Monaco is Directed by Olivier Dahan and it stars Nicole Kidman, Milo Ventimiglia, Paz Vega, Tim Roth, Parker Posey, Frank Langella, Derek Jacobi, Geraldine Somerville and Roger Ashton- Griffiths. "The story of former Hollywood star Grace Kelly's crisis of marriage and identity, during a political dispute between Monaco's Prince Rainier III and France's Charles De Gaulle, and a looming French invasion of Monaco in the early 1960s."\n\nWell Grace of Monaco is not a straight up F movie, the movie does have it's redeeming things but for a movie that had such big buzz, for a movie that has such talent involved(in and out of camera), i got to say that this is still an incredibly flawed movie and very disappointing indeed.\n\nI think this was a semi-interesting story, Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier III relationship and her whole adaptation to the her new life was kind of an interesting story, that could be told brilliantly and even earn some awards but this is not that story. I chose that quote from the movie: "The idea of my life as a fairy tale is itself a fairy tale", because basically what the movie presents us is a fairy tale version of actual events, the movie shows us a fairy tale that is quite ludicrous and naive at times but it shows us without being aware of what it is, the story is presented in a very self-serious way. The movie's major flaw is really it's screenplay and direction, the screenplay is totally insane, it's plain stupid at times and basically the director takes this script and tries to make a kind "King Speech" bio-pic.\n\nArash Amel's screenplay is really where it all begins, it's an empty screenplay. So we have Grace Kelly who is having some problems in her marriage, she feels to much pressure being a princess and she feels a disappointment Kelly is really the only character that at times pops out of the screen and it's really because of Kidman, the rest of the characters have nothing to say and when they do the dialogue is dull and incredibly bland. Tim Roth, Paz Vega, Derek Jacobi, Frank Langella are the supporting roles in this movie and their characters simply have no weight, they are boring they really are just cardboard tick. This movie should never had gotten such talented actors for such a weak screenplay.\n\nAnd unfortunately the direction is not any better, with Olivier Dahan giving violent shifts in tone, at times the movie is very but very serious and it tries to focus on Kelly's problems as an artist and at other times it kind of becomes a comedy i mean not only because what's written it's ridiculous but because the approach is not the best either, i mean even the score at times makes it feel like we are watching a comedy. The movie does hit a low point when all the the sudden, we are not watching a Bio-Pic nor a Drama or Comedy but a thriller with spies and sh*t it was at that time that threw the towel down because things had gotten a bit to ridiculous and the movie is really just all over the place tone wise. I mean i also have to mention that all those meeting scenes about whether or not there would be an invasion were really terrible too, i mean just amateurish with no kind of tension or even believability.\n\nNicole Kidman is a great talent and she rally gives her all here but even her was kind of hard to buy as Grace Kelly. She really gives her heart and talent to this movie that didn't really deserve it, her performance is really what kept me watching this movie and she carries it on her back but even her was not nearly enough. The movie does look pretty good for the most part, with some good cinematography and Set-Decoration but i mean that is more or less expected from this kind of period piece.\n\nGrace of Monaco is quite a big fat mess although not as terrible as some said. This is a bad movie no doubt on that, with a disgusting screenplay and direction that's out of hand, still it's elevated by a good lead performance by Kidman who could not save the day.\n\nRating:C-","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19394,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-05-14","keywords":"monaco,1960s,betrayal,charles de gaulle character,alfred hitchcock character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3188107801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A snapshot of a year in the life of Grace Kelly as she strived to reconcile her past and her present, a yearning for a return to the big screen with her newfound role as a mother of two, monarch of a European principality and wife to Prince Ranier III.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672422/","name":"André Penvern"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196860/","name":"Olivier Dahan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0374957/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362130/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305542/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3885069/","name":"Arash Amel"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The reviews bashed the movie, many said that it was unforgettable because it was the worst Cannes opener they had ever seen. And although the movie has only been released for about a month, everybody seems to have already forgotten it, well i still had interest in seeing it, i mean how bad could it actually be?\n\nGrace of Monaco is Directed by Olivier Dahan and it stars Nicole Kidman, Milo Ventimiglia, Paz Vega, Tim Roth, Parker Posey, Frank Langella, Derek Jacobi, Geraldine Somerville and Roger Ashton- Griffiths. "The story of former Hollywood star Grace Kelly's crisis of marriage and identity, during a political dispute between Monaco's Prince Rainier III and France's Charles De Gaulle, and a looming French invasion of Monaco in the early 1960s."\n\nWell Grace of Monaco is not a straight up F movie, the movie does have it's redeeming things but for a movie that had such big buzz, for a movie that has such talent involved(in and out of camera), i got to say that this is still an incredibly flawed movie and very disappointing indeed.\n\nI think this was a semi-interesting story, Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier III relationship and her whole adaptation to the her new life was kind of an interesting story, that could be told brilliantly and even earn some awards but this is not that story. I chose that quote from the movie: "The idea of my life as a fairy tale is itself a fairy tale", because basically what the movie presents us is a fairy tale version of actual events, the movie shows us a fairy tale that is quite ludicrous and naive at times but it shows us without being aware of what it is, the story is presented in a very self-serious way. The movie's major flaw is really it's screenplay and direction, the screenplay is totally insane, it's plain stupid at times and basically the director takes this script and tries to make a kind "King Speech" bio-pic.\n\nArash Amel's screenplay is really where it all begins, it's an empty screenplay. So we have Grace Kelly who is having some problems in her marriage, she feels to much pressure being a princess and she feels a disappointment Kelly is really the only character that at times pops out of the screen and it's really because of Kidman, the rest of the characters have nothing to say and when they do the dialogue is dull and incredibly bland. Tim Roth, Paz Vega, Derek Jacobi, Frank Langella are the supporting roles in this movie and their characters simply have no weight, they are boring they really are just cardboard tick. This movie should never had gotten such talented actors for such a weak screenplay.\n\nAnd unfortunately the direction is not any better, with Olivier Dahan giving violent shifts in tone, at times the movie is very but very serious and it tries to focus on Kelly's problems as an artist and at other times it kind of becomes a comedy i mean not only because what's written it's ridiculous but because the approach is not the best either, i mean even the score at times makes it feel like we are watching a comedy. The movie does hit a low point when all the the sudden, we are not watching a Bio-Pic nor a Drama or Comedy but a thriller with spies and sh*t it was at that time that threw the towel down because things had gotten a bit to ridiculous and the movie is really just all over the place tone wise. I mean i also have to mention that all those meeting scenes about whether or not there would be an invasion were really terrible too, i mean just amateurish with no kind of tension or even believability.\n\nNicole Kidman is a great talent and she rally gives her all here but even her was kind of hard to buy as Grace Kelly. She really gives her heart and talent to this movie that didn't really deserve it, her performance is really what kept me watching this movie and she carries it on her back but even her was not nearly enough. The movie does look pretty good for the most part, with some good cinematography and Set-Decoration but i mean that is more or less expected from this kind of period piece.\n\nGrace of Monaco is quite a big fat mess although not as terrible as some said. This is a bad movie no doubt on that, with a disgusting screenplay and direction that's out of hand, still it's elevated by a good lead performance by Kidman who could not save the day.\n\nRating:C-","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19394,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-05-14","keywords":"monaco,1960s,betrayal,charles de gaulle character,alfred hitchcock character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3188107801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzU3MzY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEwMDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A snapshot of a year in the life of Grace Kelly as she strived to reconcile her past and her present, a yearning for a return to the big screen with her newfound role as a mother of two, monarch of a European principality and wife to Prince Ranier III.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672422/","name":"André Penvern"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196860/","name":"Olivier Dahan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0374957/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362130/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305542/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3885069/","name":"Arash Amel"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It provides a behind the scenes take on the discovery and the development of the virus, as well as the political developments that caused it to spiral out of control.\n\nAlex Gibney does a good job of explaining the technical aspects of the computer virus, as well as the political context that spurred the United States and Israel to develop the computer virus. He assembles a good cast of interviewees from various perspectives on the issue. Although Gibney has a definite viewpoint, he gives both sides of the question a hearing.\n\nAlthough I had previously watched news coverage dealing with Stuxnet, this documentary goes far more in depth, making good use of inside sources within the NSA.

It provides a behind the scenes take on the discovery and the development of the virus, as well as the political developments that caused it to spiral out of control.\n\nAlex Gibney does a good job of explaining the technical aspects of the computer virus, as well as the political context that spurred the United States and Israel to develop the computer virus. He assembles a good cast of interviewees from various perspectives on the issue. Although Gibney has a definite viewpoint, he gives both sides of the question a hearing.\n\nAlthough I had previously watched news coverage dealing with Stuxnet, this documentary goes far more in depth, making good use of inside sources within the NSA. In particular, Gibney examines the split that emerged between the United States and Israel over the use of the virus, ultimately culminating in a near disaster. The film provides a disturbing warning of how the American and Israeli governments have potentially opened a Pandora's box.\n\nThis film is important viewing that should be seen by everyone interested in current events or concerned over the implications of American foreign policy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9389,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2016-07-08","keywords":"iran,cyber attack,computer worm,hacking,stuxnet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3677533209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTg2MDExMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI5ODY5ODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTg2MDExMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI5ODY5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"a documentary thriller about the world of cyberwar.

I didn't understand the negative responses, nor the logics about the scenes many are writing. This is a movie, well, I prefer everyone to watch and judge by themselves.

This is the work of a nice script and direction. Although the film could be better in many ways if we put intense logics in every scene and action.

No Crate and Barrel at all in the first 3 episodes. The Sovereigns plot line seemed a bit lame, especially at the end of the season and what happened there. And a very disappointing J.

Murrow" Collection from CBS for years and have enjoyed watching it's biography of Murrow, the complete Milo Radulovich, McCarthy and Annie Lee Moss shows many times. I'm sure George Clooney must have these as well as he used the actual footage extensively in his fine drama "Good Night and Good Luck". As a previous poster said, by concentrating on what was actually presented, Clooney is able to focus on the ethical issues that were the real substance of the broadcasts, rather than the tragicomic personalities involved. He wants us to see that the same issues are in our lives today, (Clooney has had his own battles with would-be modern McCarthys like Bill O'Reilly), but he isn't going to force the issue. He's doing exactly what Murrow and Friendly did with the McCarthy broadcast: using the actual record to tell the story.\n\nThere are minor, but significant embellishments, mostly an impressive cast of actors who can tell us more with one look than an entire speech. Leading the way is David Straithairn as Murrow. Except for possessing a higher pitched voice than the original, he's got his man down cold. I would pick Frank Langella as William Paley, here presented as a man with ideals but who is rooted in the realities of business, the sort of guy who has to make the tough decisions the idealists like Murrow don't have to or want to deal with. Then there is Ray Wise as the vulnerable Don Hollenbeck, who was one of the co-creators of "You Are There", a program this film somewhat resembles. He wound up being "there" when he didn't really want to be.\n\nWhat really enhances the show is the black and white photography, (actually, according to the notes, it was "The film was shot on color film on a grayscale set, then color-corrected in post"  whatever that means). Not only does it heighten the drama, (magazine photographers, in the days when they had a choice, said "black and white for drama, color for excitement"), but the tremendous resolution seems to bring out each furrow and poor on each person's face, allowing the viewer to see into their souls.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95961,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2005-11-04","keywords":"reporter,journalist,1950s,radio,politician","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Good Night, and Good Luck","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2963931417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Independent Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000657/","name":"David Strathairn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0165101/","name":"Patricia Clarkson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106448/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005596/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381416/","name":"Grant Heslov"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Not only does it heighten the drama, (magazine photographers, in the days when they had a choice, said "black and white for drama, color for excitement"), but the tremendous resolution seems to bring out each furrow and poor on each person's face, allowing the viewer to see into their souls.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95961,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2005-11-04","keywords":"reporter,journalist,1950s,radio,politician","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Good Night, and Good Luck","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2963931417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ExYzk3ZmYtYjQwZi00MjhkLWEzZGQtNTIzYzI3MjgxNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Independent Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000657/","name":"David Strathairn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0165101/","name":"Patricia Clarkson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106448/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005596/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381416/","name":"Grant Heslov"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Also, (at the beginning of the movie) a little bit of Wakaliwood productions and their $80 budget movies. Too bad that a lot of people cannot understand this kind of humor, thinking that this is just a bad movie. Absurd humor is so rare today. This kind of people cannot also understand sarcasm or black/dark humor. They will just get offended if you make this type of jokes. So sad. 8/10 just because, probably, around 20% of the jokes were way too lame and unnecessary. But you can find a lot of funny clever absurd jokes. Overall, a very, very funny movie.

Also, (at the beginning of the movie) a little bit of Wakaliwood productions and their $80 budget movies. Too bad that a lot of people cannot understand this kind of humor, thinking that this is just a bad movie. Absurd humor is so rare today. This kind of people cannot also understand sarcasm or black/dark humor. They will just get offended if you make this type of jokes. So sad. 8/10 just because, probably, around 20% of the jokes were way too lame and unnecessary. But you can find a lot of funny clever absurd jokes. Overall, a very, very funny movie.

Excellent movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":502356,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-01-21","keywords":"artificial intelligence,turing test,minimal cast,robot human relationship,robot","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi744337689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young programmer is selected to participate in a breakthrough experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breathtaking female A.I.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2539953/","name":"Alicia Vikander","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1727304/","name":"Domhnall Gleeson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390816/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I feel this movie aces both.\n\nA secluded environment and very good original music set the mood for full focus on story and character development. The plot twists time and time again as an intelligence power-play is delivered with very good performances by this little known cast. Character development feels perfect as each one gains depth without loosing essence.\n\nFrom a sci-fi point of view, it's not you're typical FX based movie, nor is it an action film. Nevertheless some very good effects and acting make for an excellent merge between fact and fiction that lets you concentrate on the philosophical questions the movie asks about the nature of AI. \n\nConclusion: I'd recommend this film to anyone. Though warning it concentrates on the brain rather than the muscle. Excellent movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":502356,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-01-21","keywords":"artificial intelligence,turing test,minimal cast,robot human relationship,robot","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi744337689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young programmer is selected to participate in a breakthrough experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breathtaking female A.I.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2539953/","name":"Alicia Vikander"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1727304/","name":"Domhnall Gleeson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390816/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I feel this movie aces both.\n\nA secluded environment and very good original music set the mood for full focus on story and character development. The plot twists time and time again as an intelligence power-play is delivered with very good performances by this little known cast. Character development feels perfect as each one gains depth without loosing essence.\n\nFrom a sci-fi point of view, it's not you're typical FX based movie, nor is it an action film. Nevertheless some very good effects and acting make for an excellent merge between fact and fiction that lets you concentrate on the philosophical questions the movie asks about the nature of AI. \n\nConclusion: I'd recommend this film to anyone. Though warning it concentrates on the brain rather than the muscle. Excellent movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":502356,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-01-21","keywords":"artificial intelligence,turing test,minimal cast,robot human relationship,robot","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi744337689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young programmer is selected to participate in a breakthrough experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breathtaking female A.I.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2539953/","name":"Alicia Vikander","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1727304/","name":"Domhnall Gleeson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390816/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's some time since I wrote this review and I took thirty minutes tonight to read the other reviews on this movie, not surprisingly they are mostly very positive and unanimous in praising it. Interestingly, the critics, including the one named above, who trashed the movie without even seeing it, obviously did so in an effort to kill it at the box office. While many other reviewers noted this too, I'd like to point out that those critics and possibly some of the people who 'dont like Tom Cruise because of his weird religion' are actually following the same path that made it possible for Hitler to kill off millions of Jews who also had a 'weird religion'.

However, this movie gives a brutal insight into some meaningless and worthless lives, of which plenty exists in our world. It is wonderfully played and directed, while the storyline sticks to the real stigma of low-life, survival, and struggle.\n\nWhy am I writing this? I was only 17-years old when I was desperate to escape a wretched child and youthhood. Back then, I met a woman who made me feel comfortable, loved an understood; never mind she was 6 years my senior and was mother to three children from her first marriage. I fell for her - and failed but struggled on for an unbelievable 45 years.\n\nIf some state here that this movie is nothing more than a 'wandering tale', than I dare to argue that that is what life is. Life is not fixed, nor does it proceed steadily. There are always difficulties, arguments, disagreements, and struggles. Even more so when people hit the lows and must live with little or no prospects. However, life can get compelling and testing when relationships evolve that have not much hope from the outset.\n\nThis movie leads the viewer in a very realistic surround of financial and relational struggles. To intensify the story, Weyland (Pablo) plays a character who was just released from prison after 15 years, meaning he would have had no real prospects of getting a fair chance or a decent job. Indeed, that gives the story another edge while leading the viewer in a world, 'normal' people cannot relate to.\n\nOverall, it is a movie worth watching. It may seem boring for some, but others may find some resemblances to their own lives, past or present. The actors played their roles well and realistic, while I give credit to the director for packing so much real-life' into a small movie.\n\nI really did enjoy and digest this great story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":997,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-07-30","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1980416025","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After 15 years in prison, Wayland (Pablo Schreiber) reunites with his high school girlfriend, Dolores (Jena Malone), who is now a single mother of three.

However, this movie gives a brutal insight into some meaningless and worthless lives, of which plenty exists in our world. It is wonderfully played and directed, while the storyline sticks to the real stigma of low-life, survival, and struggle.\n\nWhy am I writing this? I was only 17-years old when I was desperate to escape a wretched child and youthhood. Back then, I met a woman who made me feel comfortable, loved an understood; never mind she was 6 years my senior and was mother to three children from her first marriage. I fell for her - and failed but struggled on for an unbelievable 45 years.\n\nIf some state here that this movie is nothing more than a 'wandering tale', than I dare to argue that that is what life is. Life is not fixed, nor does it proceed steadily. There are always difficulties, arguments, disagreements, and struggles. Even more so when people hit the lows and must live with little or no prospects. However, life can get compelling and testing when relationships evolve that have not much hope from the outset.\n\nThis movie leads the viewer in a very realistic surround of financial and relational struggles. To intensify the story, Weyland (Pablo) plays a character who was just released from prison after 15 years, meaning he would have had no real prospects of getting a fair chance or a decent job. Indeed, that gives the story another edge while leading the viewer in a world, 'normal' people cannot relate to.\n\nOverall, it is a movie worth watching. It may seem boring for some, but others may find some resemblances to their own lives, past or present. The actors played their roles well and realistic, while I give credit to the director for packing so much real-life' into a small movie.\n\nI really did enjoy and digest this great story.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":997,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-07-30","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1980416025","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwNDEyMGItNGRjZi00OTQwLTk1NTEtMDViMWFhNzI0M2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After 15 years in prison, Wayland (Pablo Schreiber) reunites with his high school girlfriend, Dolores (Jena Malone), who is now a single mother of three.

Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal .

I am watching with someone who is hard of hearing and has to mostly read the script. Last night they were talking of furniture in the French Louis XV style. It is always read as Louis the fifteenth or often in French Quinze (pronounced cans - and that is exactly what the close caption said in the style of Louis cans - I had to explain that one to my mom!) Then a few moments later, Miss Marple talked about the problem of yarn balls vs skeins, except the close caption said yarn scans. So confusing for the reader. There are mistakes and horrible scripting throughout almost every episode.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6990,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-12-12","keywords":"united kingdom,murder,detective,female detective,england","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568603/","name":"Geraldine McEwan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571549/","name":"Julia McKenzie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161410/","name":"Stephen Churchett"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104279/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103605/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041824/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Agatha Christie's Marple: The Julia McKenzie Collection","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4158173977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA0OWUwNDEtNjBmMS00OTQ4LThmOWItYTBkNDY4M2RhYWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA0OWUwNDEtNjBmMS00OTQ4LThmOWItYTBkNDY4M2RhYWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Agatha Christie's Marple: The Julia McKenzie Collection"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Perhaps a little formulaic and not particularly creative in its plot devices, but altogether an enjoyable way to while away an hour on a Friday night. In fact, I may now read the novels after all.\n\nHowever, as I haven't read them I can't really comment on the criticisms of other reviewers that the storyline was changed and that the main character suffered in her translation from print to screen. Obviously it's often difficult to leave a story unchanged because it just doesn't work in film the way it does in a book; and who knows what other (budgetary) restrictions the production was working within.\n\nThe sometimes ponderous camera work and precise, deliberate acting reminded me pleasantly of the Poirot series- although Phryne Fisher is rather racier than the little Belgian. I enjoyed the recreation of late-20s Melbourne, including the bright, interesting wardrobe of the leading lady. I got a little annoyed in some of the middle episodes that the storyline concerning Phryne's sister appeared to be dropped as it was the most intriguing thing about the early episodes, but I was satisfied by the end of the series. I also liked the development of the friendship between Phryne and Jack Robinson, and Hugh &amp; Dot were quite cute too.\n\nDon't sit down to this expecting something mind-altering or deeply intellectual. This is quality b-grade and proud of it; it does its thing very well indeed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14795,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-02-24","keywords":"liberated woman,headstrong woman,detective,surname in series title,equality for women","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204583/","name":"Essie Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0656289/","name":"Nathan Page","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3793639/","name":"Hugo Johnstone-Burt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346452/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3789075225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWVhZTMxY2MtMjc1MS00MjkwLTg4ODktZmVmYmU1YjM5NjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries: Series 3"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has all the elements to make it an award winning piece. Great complicated characters that work well with each other, mystery, intrigue, excitement, shell shock, suggestive, authentic and genuine. Who new that Germany had the ability to produce a show like this that would compete with BBC period series. It is well written and the cinematography and sets really take you back to what it could have been in Berlin 1920s. The poverty, life, rich, poor, politics, morality, ethics and corruption are all part of the story. I have the benefit of being able to watch this with English subtitles or I would have missed the opportunity to really enjoy this show. Unfortunately, whom ever translated it, their English is not the first language and at times the sentences are backwards in English which is normally when someone is translating verbatim but I get the gist of it. If you like time pieces and or like shows such as Endeavor, George Gently, Trapped, Modus and similar then you are likely to enjoy this program.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21197,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-10-13","keywords":"berlin germany,1920s,police,weimar republic,interwar period","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1432815/","name":"Volker Bruch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2939186/","name":"Liv Lisa Fries"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2914059/","name":"Leonie Benesch"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061958/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044017/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359634/","name":"Henk Handloegten"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0902022/","name":"Achim von Borries"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer Season 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2628238873","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3YWI2YzctZjNmYS00OGRhLTk3MzgtNDA2ZWU3ZmVjODA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3YWI2YzctZjNmYS00OGRhLTk3MzgtNDA2ZWU3ZmVjODA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now, we get to see inside the daily lives of a family whose job is to solve crimes, instead of committing them, and thanks to an ensemble of gifted actors, it's quite interesting to see their interactions, both personally and professionally.\n\nFrank Reagan is the chief of police in New York City, a man deeply respected by his family and the people he works with. His oldest son Danny (Donnie Wahlberg) is a homicide detective with a reputation for not doing things by the book, and in the first episode already he sticks someones head in a toilet to get the location of a missing girl out of him. While people admire as someone who gets the job done, he has alienated several people over the years through his views and methods, including his sister Erin (Bridget Moynahan). She is a district attorney, and since Danny often uses unorthodox and even illegal methods to arrest criminals, she has a hard time with convicting them, causing them to argue quite frequently. Jamie (Will Estes) is their youngest brother, and after finishing law school, suddenly decides to become a police officer, much to the dismay of his fiancé. Although still a rookie, he is approached by a secret society called the Blue Templars, who wish to hire him to investigate the death of his brother, who was a cop himself and was shot while investigating a case.\n\nThe show comes up with an interesting concept,showing us the interaction of these four family members while investigating crimes and how they often clash in their believes and principles. Donnie Wahlberg's character Danny is probably the most interesting one of the bunch, mainly because it's hinted at that he was in Iraq, and that his tendency to loose patience with the people he arrests is rooted in something he experienced there. It's good to have Tom Selleck back on TV, who is a better actor now than ever, and since I already liked him in the Jesse Stones movies, it's great that I get to see him every week now.\n\nYou can watch Blue Bloods every Friday at 10 on CBS, and since it's one of the most successful shows that have ever aired in the time slot, it looks like it stands a very high chance of surviving for more than a season, which will be an achievement not shared by too many of the new shows, I'm sure.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35081,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-09-24","keywords":"new york police department,family relationships,brother brother relationship,father daughter relationship,family of cops","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005531/","name":"Donnie Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005256/","name":"Bridget Moynahan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0261678/","name":"Will Estes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106949/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315236/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121331/","name":"Mitchell Burgess"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1053841/","name":"Robin Green"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blue Bloods: Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4119967769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"First Look Trailer for Blue Bloods"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Whatever I expected this to be, it turned out far better. Adam Brody gave an amazing performance, somewhat similar to a live action BoJack Horseman in this movie (obviously with detectives instead of actors). The comedy is really good too, the film knows how to make the audience laugh and when it's appropriate to do so. Not every line is hilarious, but a majority of the jokes tend to land. A sign of a good movie is, despite however much comedy it is, it's plot is well thought out, unpredictable, and possibly one of the most well done mysteries I've seen. It fits perfectly with the tone, plot, and characters. And the ending! The ending! Something so different from the rest of the movie, but something that works so well with it! When the film wraps, it leaves you wanting nothing but for Abe Applebaum's next mystery.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-10-16","keywords":"voice over narration,private detective,small town,african american policeman,camera shot from inside a closet","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Kid Detective [Trailer]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3983655193","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMWU2NDItNjAzZS00NGMzLWIzODUtNGM0YWY3ZGYwMDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMWU2NDItNjAzZS00NGMzLWIzODUtNGM0YWY3ZGYwMDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A once-celebrated kid detective (Adam Brody), now 31, continues to solve the same trivial mysteries between hangovers and bouts of self-pity.

Whatever I expected this to be, it turned out far better. Adam Brody gave an amazing performance, somewhat similar to a live action BoJack Horseman in this movie (obviously with detectives instead of actors). The comedy is really good too, the film knows how to make the audience laugh and when it's appropriate to do so. Not every line is hilarious, but a majority of the jokes tend to land. A sign of a good movie is, despite however much comedy it is, it's plot is well thought out, unpredictable, and possibly one of the most well done mysteries I've seen. It fits perfectly with the tone, plot, and characters. And the ending! The ending! Something so different from the rest of the movie, but something that works so well with it! When the film wraps, it leaves you wanting nothing but for Abe Applebaum's next mystery.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-10-16","keywords":"voice over narration,private detective,small town,african american policeman,camera shot from inside a closet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Kid Detective [Trailer]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3983655193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMWU2NDItNjAzZS00NGMzLWIzODUtNGM0YWY3ZGYwMDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMWU2NDItNjAzZS00NGMzLWIzODUtNGM0YWY3ZGYwMDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A once-celebrated kid detective (Adam Brody), now 31, continues to solve the same trivial mysteries between hangovers and bouts of self-pity.

Now, we get to see inside the daily lives of a family whose job is to solve crimes, instead of committing them, and thanks to an ensemble of gifted actors, it's quite interesting to see their interactions, both personally and professionally.\n\nFrank Reagan is the chief of police in New York City, a man deeply respected by his family and the people he works with. His oldest son Danny (Donnie Wahlberg) is a homicide detective with a reputation for not doing things by the book, and in the first episode already he sticks someones head in a toilet to get the location of a missing girl out of him. While people admire as someone who gets the job done, he has alienated several people over the years through his views and methods, including his sister Erin (Bridget Moynahan). She is a district attorney, and since Danny often uses unorthodox and even illegal methods to arrest criminals, she has a hard time with convicting them, causing them to argue quite frequently. Jamie (Will Estes) is their youngest brother, and after finishing law school, suddenly decides to become a police officer, much to the dismay of his fiancé.

Revolves around a family of New York cops." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt1595859/","name":"Blue Bloods","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY0NTE1ODU3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI4NDQwMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Revolves around a family of New York cops.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1595859/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"fred-kolb","dateCreated":"2010-10-10","inLanguage":"English","name":"Selleck is back in a great TV Show, as the patriarch of a New York cop family!","reviewBody":"The new shows this fall have almost all been hugely disappointing, starting with the new "Law and Order: LA" which proves that the concept of the show is starting to get old, "The Event" is yet another bunch of twists and turns that will end in the middle of nowhere sooner or later and the hugely anticipated "Hawaii-Five-O" started out strong, but has now taken a turn for the worse, although it's still among the better new shows, which frankly isn't saying much.\n\n"Blue Bloods", on the other hand, really stands out as a gritty and quite realistic police drama, made by the producers of the hugely successful and dearly missed "The Sopranos". Now, we get to see inside the daily lives of a family whose job is to solve crimes, instead of committing them, and thanks to an ensemble of gifted actors, it's quite interesting to see their interactions, both personally and professionally.\n\nFrank Reagan is the chief of police in New York City, a man deeply respected by his family and the people he works with. His oldest son Danny (Donnie Wahlberg) is a homicide detective with a reputation for not doing things by the book, and in the first episode already he sticks someones head in a toilet to get the location of a missing girl out of him. While people admire as someone who gets the job done, he has alienated several people over the years through his views and methods, including his sister Erin (Bridget Moynahan). She is a district attorney, and since Danny often uses unorthodox and even illegal methods to arrest criminals, she has a hard time with convicting them, causing them to argue quite frequently. Jamie (Will Estes) is their youngest brother, and after finishing law school, suddenly decides to become a police officer, much to the dismay of his fiancé. Although still a rookie, he is approached by a secret society called the Blue Templars, who wish to hire him to investigate the death of his brother, who was a cop himself and was shot while investigating a case.\n\nThe show comes up with an interesting concept,showing us the interaction of these four family members while investigating crimes and how they often clash in their believes and principles. Donnie Wahlberg's character Danny is probably the most interesting one of the bunch, mainly because it's hinted at that he was in Iraq, and that his tendency to loose patience with the people he arrests is rooted in something he experienced there.

Now, we get to see inside the daily lives of a family whose job is to solve crimes, instead of committing them, and thanks to an ensemble of gifted actors, it's quite interesting to see their interactions, both personally and professionally.\n\nFrank Reagan is the chief of police in New York City, a man deeply respected by his family and the people he works with. His oldest son Danny (Donnie Wahlberg) is a homicide detective with a reputation for not doing things by the book, and in the first episode already he sticks someones head in a toilet to get the location of a missing girl out of him. While people admire as someone who gets the job done, he has alienated several people over the years through his views and methods, including his sister Erin (Bridget Moynahan). She is a district attorney, and since Danny often uses unorthodox and even illegal methods to arrest criminals, she has a hard time with convicting them, causing them to argue quite frequently. Jamie (Will Estes) is their youngest brother, and after finishing law school, suddenly decides to become a police officer, much to the dismay of his fiancé. Although still a rookie, he is approached by a secret society called the Blue Templars, who wish to hire him to investigate the death of his brother, who was a cop himself and was shot while investigating a case.\n\nThe show comes up with an interesting concept,showing us the interaction of these four family members while investigating crimes and how they often clash in their believes and principles. Donnie Wahlberg's character Danny is probably the most interesting one of the bunch, mainly because it's hinted at that he was in Iraq, and that his tendency to loose patience with the people he arrests is rooted in something he experienced there. It's good to have Tom Selleck back on TV, who is a better actor now than ever, and since I already liked him in the Jesse Stones movies, it's great that I get to see him every week now.\n\nYou can watch Blue Bloods every Friday at 10 on CBS, and since it's one of the most successful shows that have ever aired in the time slot, it looks like it stands a very high chance of surviving for more than a season, which will be an achievement not shared by too many of the new shows, I'm sure.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35081,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-09-24","keywords":"new york police department,family relationships,brother brother relationship,father daughter relationship,family of cops","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005531/","name":"Donnie Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005256/","name":"Bridget Moynahan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0261678/","name":"Will Estes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106949/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315236/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121331/","name":"Mitchell Burgess"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1053841/","name":"Robin Green"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Blue Bloods: Series","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4119967769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YzZGNkZGMtYzFlMS00NDRhLTlkNmItMzZhZjVkNTdiMTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"First Look Trailer for Blue Bloods"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Heartbreaking aftermath. Beautiful love story. Powerful history lesson. All in one. Worth every tear.","reviewBody":"I want to start by saying that I did not find The Nightingale excessively violent. And believe me, I hate movie violence. But I feel like I've seen trailers for action flicks that had more. Plenty of TV shows do as well. Maybe not rape, but still. Perhaps the reason it didn't feel excessive was because the movie doesn't dwell on it. It avoids gore, except in a few places where it really was necessary. Not only is there absolutely nothing gratuitous, each of those scenes has in it so much more than just "oh, look, they kill", "oh, look, they rape." For example, both women who are raped are mothers. Both are torn away from their very young children in the process. So, not only are they brutally violated, I was horrified thinking what must have been going through their minds knowing that the children are out there, helpless, crying, and they can't protect them.\n\nAt the center of the story is an Irish convict named Clare (Aisling Franciosi) and an aboriginal man named Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) whom she convinces to guide her through the wilderness to the men lead by Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin) who "took something from her". But it is nowhere near a simple revenge story.\n\nThe film offers a history lesson that might be more affecting than anything with names and dates. It's a sharp and clear look at what violence does to people, not just the victims, but the perpetrators too. It's easy to see what happened there earlier. White people take the land, the aboriginals fight them, soldiers brought in to fight them, the aboriginals fight back, and it spiraled on and on turning the whole place into the land of "bad spirits" that we find in the film. We see people that are dead, even if their bodies are still alive. The white woman holding a baby while looking at her burning house. An older aboriginal tracker forced to witness horrific violence against one of his own and then keep guiding the very perpetrators. A convict who saw two others killed right in front of him - tellingly one by an aboriginal and another by an officer.\n\nThe soldiers, who are there not exactly on their own free will, are taught to dehumanize the locals as well as the convicts they are guarding. We can see the beginnings of the process in the young officer and in the convict boy Hawkins takes a brief interest in. We can see how it's kill or be killed, quite possibly by one of your own. But by dehumanizing the others they are dehumanizing themselves eventually becoming like Hawkins and his hapless sidekick Ruse (Damon Herriman). The film doesn't let anyone off the hook. There's a heartbreaking scene that reminds us that even settlers who are nice and kind and, what we would now call, woke are still living on the stolen land.\n\nClare is an orphan who found herself having to steal to survive which landed her in that hell hole of a place as a young girl. Now 21 she finally has things starting to look up for her. A husband, a little hut, a beautiful baby girl. Life. Hope. But her long earned freedom is in the hands of Hawkins who is mildly infatuated with her and wants to keep her for himself. When her husband's ill conceived attempt to break her free brings on a horrible tragedy, she too is pulled into the vortex of violence. And Billy, who is trying to keep his head down and avoid trouble in spite of having suffered enormously from the colonizers, is pulled in along with her. But it is their relationship that holds them and the film together. Watching it move slowly from an understandable distrust to a deep bond melts your heart. To me it's really a love story.\n\nI found the film pulling me in like few have ever done. It was as if I was there, feeling what the characters were feeling as much as it can be possible sitting in my comfortable 21st century chair. I wasn't just grieving for them, I was grieving with them, a few times finding myself breaking down literally seconds before one of them did. This has never happened to me before. I think it's because everything flows so organically. Every mood change, every action, dream, nightmare is right in its place and palpably real. No small feat for something that is also rich with allegory. And the acting is fantastic across the board. Franciosi's performance is raw and alive, like a pulsating vein as she goes through a myriad of subtle changes of emotions. Layers of emotions. Clare never loses her vulnerability, no matter how much rage she is in or how much confidence she is trying to project. That's what makes her so compelling. Ganambarr is a revelation as Billy. He moves seamlessly, with barely a change of tone between being an occasional comic relief, talking about his culture with quiet, yet forceful passion, and revealing just how much he's been hurt, and he is perfect every step of the way. You can see the pain buried inside him slowly seeping out as the movie progresses. And Hawkins could have been a run of the mill villain, but Claflin fleshes him out as someone who commits violence not out of strength, but out of weakness. He is unable to control anything, from soldiers under his command to his own career. Impotent both figuratively and literally, he kills and rapes as a means of control.

Heartbreaking aftermath. Beautiful love story. Powerful history lesson. All in one. Worth every tear.","reviewBody":"I want to start by saying that I did not find The Nightingale excessively violent. And believe me, I hate movie violence. But I feel like I've seen trailers for action flicks that had more. Plenty of TV shows do as well. Maybe not rape, but still. Perhaps the reason it didn't feel excessive was because the movie doesn't dwell on it. It avoids gore, except in a few places where it really was necessary. Not only is there absolutely nothing gratuitous, each of those scenes has in it so much more than just "oh, look, they kill", "oh, look, they rape." For example, both women who are raped are mothers. Both are torn away from their very young children in the process. So, not only are they brutally violated, I was horrified thinking what must have been going through their minds knowing that the children are out there, helpless, crying, and they can't protect them.\n\nAt the center of the story is an Irish convict named Clare (Aisling Franciosi) and an aboriginal man named Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) whom she convinces to guide her through the wilderness to the men lead by Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin) who "took something from her". But it is nowhere near a simple revenge story.\n\nThe film offers a history lesson that might be more affecting than anything with names and dates. It's a sharp and clear look at what violence does to people, not just the victims, but the perpetrators too. It's easy to see what happened there earlier. White people take the land, the aboriginals fight them, soldiers brought in to fight them, the aboriginals fight back, and it spiraled on and on turning the whole place into the land of "bad spirits" that we find in the film. We see people that are dead, even if their bodies are still alive. The white woman holding a baby while looking at her burning house. An older aboriginal tracker forced to witness horrific violence against one of his own and then keep guiding the very perpetrators. A convict who saw two others killed right in front of him - tellingly one by an aboriginal and another by an officer.\n\nThe soldiers, who are there not exactly on their own free will, are taught to dehumanize the locals as well as the convicts they are guarding. We can see the beginnings of the process in the young officer and in the convict boy Hawkins takes a brief interest in. We can see how it's kill or be killed, quite possibly by one of your own. But by dehumanizing the others they are dehumanizing themselves eventually becoming like Hawkins and his hapless sidekick Ruse (Damon Herriman). The film doesn't let anyone off the hook. There's a heartbreaking scene that reminds us that even settlers who are nice and kind and, what we would now call, woke are still living on the stolen land.\n\nClare is an orphan who found herself having to steal to survive which landed her in that hell hole of a place as a young girl. Now 21 she finally has things starting to look up for her. A husband, a little hut, a beautiful baby girl. Life. Hope. But her long earned freedom is in the hands of Hawkins who is mildly infatuated with her and wants to keep her for himself. When her husband's ill conceived attempt to break her free brings on a horrible tragedy, she too is pulled into the vortex of violence. And Billy, who is trying to keep his head down and avoid trouble in spite of having suffered enormously from the colonizers, is pulled in along with her. But it is their relationship that holds them and the film together. Watching it move slowly from an understandable distrust to a deep bond melts your heart. To me it's really a love story.\n\nI found the film pulling me in like few have ever done. It was as if I was there, feeling what the characters were feeling as much as it can be possible sitting in my comfortable 21st century chair. I wasn't just grieving for them, I was grieving with them, a few times finding myself breaking down literally seconds before one of them did. This has never happened to me before. I think it's because everything flows so organically. Every mood change, every action, dream, nightmare is right in its place and palpably real. No small feat for something that is also rich with allegory. And the acting is fantastic across the board. Franciosi's performance is raw and alive, like a pulsating vein as she goes through a myriad of subtle changes of emotions. Layers of emotions. Clare never loses her vulnerability, no matter how much rage she is in or how much confidence she is trying to project. That's what makes her so compelling. Ganambarr is a revelation as Billy. He moves seamlessly, with barely a change of tone between being an occasional comic relief, talking about his culture with quiet, yet forceful passion, and revealing just how much he's been hurt, and he is perfect every step of the way. You can see the pain buried inside him slowly seeping out as the movie progresses. And Hawkins could have been a run of the mill villain, but Claflin fleshes him out as someone who commits violence not out of strength, but out of weakness. He is unable to control anything, from soldiers under his command to his own career. Impotent both figuratively and literally, he kills and rapes as a means of control. He doesn't enjoy sex or anything else for that matter. A miserable creature, even more disgusting than he is scary - perfectly befitting someone in the last stages of inner decay.\n\nThe film loses its momentum for a bit towards the end, but just barely. I found it a riveting, breathtaking, mesmerizing watch, well worth my every tear.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25065,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-29","keywords":"rape,19th century,murder,revenge,female protagonist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4241931289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiOGNlYmYtOTA0NC00ZDI4LTg1MjgtNWIyMzg3MWVmOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJiOGNlYmYtOTA0NC00ZDI4LTg1MjgtNWIyMzg3MWVmOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young woman in 1800's Australia seeks vengeance for horrific acts committed against her family.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4957233/","name":"Aisling Franciosi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4650436/","name":"Michael Sheasby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11583458/","name":"Maya Christie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448768/","name":"Jennifer Kent"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0375200/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0634932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175594/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448768/","name":"Jennifer Kent"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

What a gem of a movie. The Guest tells a tale of a mysterious and initially benign-appearing ex-military man who claims to have served with the recently deceased son of the Peterson family. Still grieving their loss, they welcome him with open arms. All is not as it seems however and slowly, despite his psychopathic charm, young Anna Peterson suspects that something is amiss.\n\nWhat follows is a slick and stylish thriller with fluid action scenes that simmers at first before leading us to an explosive finale. The acting is solid throughout, especially from the two leads Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe who share a nice chemistry. The story, whilst simplistic and sometimes cheesy, is tight and the terse dialogue fits well. Character motivations are deliberately left vague and the film remains focused on the fact it is a thriller and doesn't overburden us with ridiculous a back-story; what back-story there is merely serves as a plot device to set-up the finale. And what a finale! Without giving spoilers, it is one of the most stylish final movie set-pieces I've seen in a long time, interjected with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek quips. Just shows what can be done with the right set, some nerves and a smoke machine; who needs CGI!\n\nA special mention must be given to the excellent soundtrack which really enhances the tension in some of the key scenes. At times I swore the bass beats were synced with my heart-rate!\n\nHighly enjoyable and highly recommended!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96349,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-05","keywords":"psychopath,ex soldier,killing spree,bullying,grief","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2685905945","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMTk0ODk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMTk0ODk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A soldier introduces himself to the Peterson family, claiming to be a friend of their son who died in action.

What a gem of a movie. The Guest tells a tale of a mysterious and initially benign-appearing ex-military man who claims to have served with the recently deceased son of the Peterson family. Still grieving their loss, they welcome him with open arms. All is not as it seems however and slowly, despite his psychopathic charm, young Anna Peterson suspects that something is amiss.\n\nWhat follows is a slick and stylish thriller with fluid action scenes that simmers at first before leading us to an explosive finale. The acting is solid throughout, especially from the two leads Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe who share a nice chemistry. The story, whilst simplistic and sometimes cheesy, is tight and the terse dialogue fits well. Character motivations are deliberately left vague and the film remains focused on the fact it is a thriller and doesn't overburden us with ridiculous a back-story; what back-story there is merely serves as a plot device to set-up the finale. And what a finale! Without giving spoilers, it is one of the most stylish final movie set-pieces I've seen in a long time, interjected with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek quips. Just shows what can be done with the right set, some nerves and a smoke machine; who needs CGI!\n\nA special mention must be given to the excellent soundtrack which really enhances the tension in some of the key scenes. At times I swore the bass beats were synced with my heart-rate!\n\nHighly enjoyable and highly recommended!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96349,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-05","keywords":"psychopath,ex soldier,killing spree,bullying,grief","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2685905945","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMTk0ODk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMTk0ODk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A soldier introduces himself to the Peterson family, claiming to be a friend of their son who died in action.

Agency show, which is rare in these days of formulaic episodic cop propaganda; yes, they're borrowing heavily from the legend just by making the show, but it does make for a certain interesting undercurrent to everything.\n\nThe cast works well, the script isn't nearly as bad as the reviews suggest, nor is the production quality in any way lacking (I think everyone was hoping for film quality attention being paid to every detail, which isn't feasible, unless you're watching Hannibal, which raised the bar to an astonishing degree). A few less moth flashbacks, and we're good. My only strong complaint is the butchery done to Catherine Martin's character, and I don't know where that storyline is going, so I'm trying to reserve judgement.\n\nHad to laugh at Clarice needing a better psychiatrist.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7726,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2021-02-11","keywords":"agent,fbi agent,female fbi agent,fbi investigation,investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2843024/","name":"Rebecca Breeds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0191044/","name":"Michael Cudlitz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0040739/","name":"Jayne Atkinson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0500500/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0845375/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0845376/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0476064/","name":"Alex Kurtzman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525886/","name":"Jenny Lumet"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi521126169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODdlNDVhYjktZTEyMC00MzkzLWI4YWYtZmNkODIyNWYxNmUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODdlNDVhYjktZTEyMC00MzkzLWI4YWYtZmNkODIyNWYxNmUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Set one year after the events of The Silence of the Lambs, join Agent Clarice Starling in this new psychological thriller that takes a deep dive into her untold personal story.

What a gem of a movie. The Guest tells a tale of a mysterious and initially benign-appearing ex-military man who claims to have served with the recently deceased son of the Peterson family. Still grieving their loss, they welcome him with open arms. All is not as it seems however and slowly, despite his psychopathic charm, young Anna Peterson suspects that something is amiss.\n\nWhat follows is a slick and stylish thriller with fluid action scenes that simmers at first before leading us to an explosive finale. The acting is solid throughout, especially from the two leads Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe who share a nice chemistry. The story, whilst simplistic and sometimes cheesy, is tight and the terse dialogue fits well. Character motivations are deliberately left vague and the film remains focused on the fact it is a thriller and doesn't overburden us with ridiculous a back-story; what back-story there is merely serves as a plot device to set-up the finale.

This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny.

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"reunited friends,funeral,old friends reunited,ash scattering,pregnant wife","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"reunited friends,funeral,old friends reunited,ash scattering,pregnant wife","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement.

This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny.

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"reunited friends,funeral,old friends reunited,ash scattering,pregnant wife","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.\n\nOverall, "Grown Ups" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and "been- there-done-that" that it's not even funny. Save your hard earned cash on another movie or just attend a matinée. Paying full price for a type of movie like this is just wasting your time and money.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"reunited friends,funeral,old friends reunited,ash scattering,pregnant wife","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable "feel good" vibe. In "Grown Up's" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. \n\n"Grown Ups" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. \n\nYep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. \n\nNow onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie?

It has been called "plodding," "stale," and "uninspired," thus, dashing the hopes of many movie goers who were hoping to see one of their favorite novels brought to life by one of their favorite directors, and starring one of their favorite actors. Since I'm not a slave to snobby film reviewers, I went to go see it for myself despite the negative hype. And as the credits rolled at the end of the movie, I felt increasingly unsettled; not because of the quality of the movie, but because one question lingered in my head: What's not to like? Am I crazy for actually being entertained by what I just saw? How could the critics pan what I, and those around me, seemed to enjoy? Okay, so that's more than one question....\n\nFirst, I have to qualify myself. I read the book and I LOVED it; couldn't put it down. I loved the history, the speculation, the riddles and puzzles, and the masterful blend of fact and fiction. Additionally, I'm not religious, although I was definitely familiar with Christian historical icons such as Jesus, John the Baptist, and Mary Magdelene before I read the book. I also happen to be a big fan of Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Ian McKellan.\n\nHaving said that, I went in prepared to like this movie, even though I had somewhat lowered my expectations based on the barrage of bad reviews. All of this proved to be a winning formula for me, apparently.\n\nIf you're like me and you loved the book and you like the artistic team that pursued making it into a movie, then you'll most likely come out satisfied. You won't mind what many critics have called "overly-long exposition" and historical flashbacks, because that's pretty much what the book consisted of. And in the book, it was absolutely engrossing! So, I personally didn't mind all of the explanation of history, symbols, etc.\n\nCritics have also found fault with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou's portrayals of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu (respectively), saying that they delivered flat performances. But once again, whoever read the book will remember that both of these characters weren't that dynamic on the written page, either. Of course, Sir Ian McKellan, with the juiciest role of Holy Grail scholar Sir Leigh Teabing, chews up the scenery every time he's shown on screen. Sir Leigh Teabing was also one of the richest characters in the book.\n\nI think that the people who won't like this movie are people who didn't read the book, and are going into the theater expecting a regular movie, which it's not. It's an adaptation of a very wordy, detailed, twisting, speculative novel that blends fact and fiction in a devastatingly effective way, and it's easy to get lost while watching the movie if you don't already know where the story is going. Sure, Ron Howard uses digitized, grainy flashbacks of ancient pagan rituals and societies to move the narrative along and to keep the audience on point, but I can see how it could be overwhelming to those who only know the bare bones of the plot. However, those who found it fascinating in the book will find pleasure in seeing the visual accompaniment to what they've already read.\n\nIn short, you go see this movie (or read the book) for how it challenges popularly-held beliefs; not for its rich, engaging character development.

It has been called "plodding," "stale," and "uninspired," thus, dashing the hopes of many movie goers who were hoping to see one of their favorite novels brought to life by one of their favorite directors, and starring one of their favorite actors. Since I'm not a slave to snobby film reviewers, I went to go see it for myself despite the negative hype. And as the credits rolled at the end of the movie, I felt increasingly unsettled; not because of the quality of the movie, but because one question lingered in my head: What's not to like? Am I crazy for actually being entertained by what I just saw? How could the critics pan what I, and those around me, seemed to enjoy? Okay, so that's more than one question....\n\nFirst, I have to qualify myself. I read the book and I LOVED it; couldn't put it down. I loved the history, the speculation, the riddles and puzzles, and the masterful blend of fact and fiction. Additionally, I'm not religious, although I was definitely familiar with Christian historical icons such as Jesus, John the Baptist, and Mary Magdelene before I read the book. I also happen to be a big fan of Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Ian McKellan.\n\nHaving said that, I went in prepared to like this movie, even though I had somewhat lowered my expectations based on the barrage of bad reviews. All of this proved to be a winning formula for me, apparently.\n\nIf you're like me and you loved the book and you like the artistic team that pursued making it into a movie, then you'll most likely come out satisfied. You won't mind what many critics have called "overly-long exposition" and historical flashbacks, because that's pretty much what the book consisted of. And in the book, it was absolutely engrossing! So, I personally didn't mind all of the explanation of history, symbols, etc.\n\nCritics have also found fault with Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou's portrayals of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu (respectively), saying that they delivered flat performances. But once again, whoever read the book will remember that both of these characters weren't that dynamic on the written page, either. Of course, Sir Ian McKellan, with the juiciest role of Holy Grail scholar Sir Leigh Teabing, chews up the scenery every time he's shown on screen. Sir Leigh Teabing was also one of the richest characters in the book.\n\nI think that the people who won't like this movie are people who didn't read the book, and are going into the theater expecting a regular movie, which it's not. It's an adaptation of a very wordy, detailed, twisting, speculative novel that blends fact and fiction in a devastatingly effective way, and it's easy to get lost while watching the movie if you don't already know where the story is going. Sure, Ron Howard uses digitized, grainy flashbacks of ancient pagan rituals and societies to move the narrative along and to keep the audience on point, but I can see how it could be overwhelming to those who only know the bare bones of the plot. However, those who found it fascinating in the book will find pleasure in seeing the visual accompaniment to what they've already read.\n\nIn short, you go see this movie (or read the book) for how it challenges popularly-held beliefs; not for its rich, engaging character development. It's a quest for the "truth", and in terms of the IDEAS expressed, they did a dag-blasted good job of translating those ideas onto the screen. Those who often complain that movies don't stay true to the books that they're based on will find comfort in the fact that Akiva Goldsman and Ron Howard have stayed incredibly close to the original text when translating it onto the screen. However, this will be to the dismay of those movie-goers who haven't read the book, and are therefore expecting a traditional action thriller with traditional action thriller dialogue.\n\nIf you go to RottenTomatoes.com, you'll see the huge disparity between what the critics have said, and what the users have said regarding this film. While the cumulative critics rating is a dismal 22%, the combined user rating is a 74%, which is way above average for the site. That should speak volumes to whoever is skeptical about seeing the movie because of the bad reviews.\n\nThe bottom line is that it's definitely a movie worth watching if only to see how the creative team behind it went about turning the best-selling novel into celluloid. It's also a treat to see something in popular culture challenge popular religious ideals so skillfully, even if only in the form of fiction.\n\nMy advice: go see for yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":414398,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-17","keywords":"self flagellation,conspiracy,bare butt male,self punishment,bound and gagged","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Da Vinci Code","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2369847833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjMWI0NzUtNTYwMC00NTZkLWJiZTctZjMwMDc2ODUyMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Blu-Ray trailer for this conspiracy thriller starring Tom Hanks","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000606/","name":"Jean Reno"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000165/","name":"Ron Howard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0124737/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326040/","name":"Akiva Goldsman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1467010/","name":"Dan Brown"],"duration":"PT2H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The original three were set in the 1930s, looking for buried treasure in a Treasure of the Sierra Madre style. The new film is set in the 1950s, and that changes everything.\n\nFrankly, it should be viewed as a new series. It certainly overlaps with the previous films, however most of that seems to affect the new film trivially. I actually think it's a little unfair to present this new type of film under the great Indiana Jones reputation, and however smart marketably I believe this, and the lack of understanding and inaccurate expectations on the audience's behalf will ultimately lead to the film's demise.\n\nThe film itself is well written, and well made with only a few exceptions. As long as you don't expect another Raiders of the Lost Ark, you'll probably be pleased with the film as it is, with the exception of one sequence which doesn't quite seem to fit. Beyond that, the plot, characters and acting all fit with this new kind of Indy film.\n\nThe cinematography is not the 80s style we'd probably all like, but it's not bad. The camera is certainly held much more stable than many of today's films, and the action is very clear and easy to follow, as is the stunt work great. There is a lot of computer animation--most of it looks believable, but some of it does not--but that which was done well fits superbly.\n\nThe acting was also very good. I was very impressed by Cate Blanchett, and to my surprise very pleased with Shia LeBeouf's character and acting.\n\nAll-in-all, I really appreciated the film as a whole, although some of the animation and action sequences seemed somewhat unfinished, or at least too difficult to believe (even for an Indy film).

The original three were set in the 1930s, looking for buried treasure in a Treasure of the Sierra Madre style. The new film is set in the 1950s, and that changes everything.\n\nFrankly, it should be viewed as a new series. It certainly overlaps with the previous films, however most of that seems to affect the new film trivially. I actually think it's a little unfair to present this new type of film under the great Indiana Jones reputation, and however smart marketably I believe this, and the lack of understanding and inaccurate expectations on the audience's behalf will ultimately lead to the film's demise.\n\nThe film itself is well written, and well made with only a few exceptions. As long as you don't expect another Raiders of the Lost Ark, you'll probably be pleased with the film as it is, with the exception of one sequence which doesn't quite seem to fit. Beyond that, the plot, characters and acting all fit with this new kind of Indy film.\n\nThe cinematography is not the 80s style we'd probably all like, but it's not bad. The camera is certainly held much more stable than many of today's films, and the action is very clear and easy to follow, as is the stunt work great. There is a lot of computer animation--most of it looks believable, but some of it does not--but that which was done well fits superbly.\n\nThe acting was also very good. I was very impressed by Cate Blanchett, and to my surprise very pleased with Shia LeBeouf's character and acting.\n\nAll-in-all, I really appreciated the film as a whole, although some of the animation and action sequences seemed somewhat unfinished, or at least too difficult to believe (even for an Indy film). Still, it is an excellent 1950s serial, and I really hope we'll see at least one other Indy film set in this new era.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":438459,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2008-05-21","keywords":"area 51,sequel,alien,amazon,colon in title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser trailer: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1622278425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDQ4NzU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwOTk1MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDQ4NzU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMwOTk1MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first trailer for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, directed by Steven Spielberg.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479471/","name":"Shia LaBeouf"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071326/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013175/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000184/","name":"George Lucas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622288/","name":"Jeff Nathanson"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A night out prior to the offer seals the LA based Dylan to relocate and take up the offer, with plenty of activities thrown in that if it's not Jamie being his only friend in a new, big city, they would serve as activities that would fit in for an awesome date night out. Before long they become firm friends, and made a pact to keep things physical since they each have their wants, and with the other party game to get down and dirty, so begins their game of tennis (though personally I prefer analogy with, and the term "bedminton" - it involves cocks after all). After all, why complicate what would be a beautiful friendship, if sex can be treated just as sex without the emotions thrown in to mess things up?\n\nYou know the clichéd drill by now, with things moving along fine and dandy, the hint of emotions coming into play to really turn things upside down, the narrative montage to show how frequent they mate like jackrabbits, before some large, needy episode or statements uttered that will probably reveal the true state of affairs, and the list goes on. Deny all you want, but one cannot help but to agree that the fairer sex will have things rough if pacts of this nature turn sour, and expectedly in a movie they always do, otherwise everyone will be happy without adversary, frustration and challenges to overcome and provide that change in strength of character.\n\nAnd it is this power of the cliché that absolutely calls the shots in films like these. You know what will happen, but want to see them happen anyway even though you're multiple steps ahead of every character. And it is precisely these expectations that anyone would want to see covered, and try as the filmmakers want it is the clichés that they find hard to break away from, even if characters here proclaim very early on that romance in their world shouldn't be like an unbelievable Hollywood film, but in what would be art imitating art, look who's talking to begin with. And what's with the fixation about consistently taking the shine off the captain of US Airways Flight 1549 in its emergency landing onto the Hudson River?\n\nJustin Timberlake is fast becoming the busy bona fide movie star since The Social Network, and continues his run with this film and In Time which will hit the screens here soon. He has that boyish charm that the camera just loves, and being a real life singer meant covering a number of songs here, from Stereophonics to Kris Kross made it look all too easy. Mila Kunis plays her role as the emotionally damaged girl with aplomb, and shares an effective chemistry with Timberlake that makes this film a delight to sit through, even if as mentioned the story's cliché and we know just about how these two nice looking people will likely get together. \n\nThe supporting characters while one dimensional almost always threaten to steal the show, from Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's sex crazed mom extending the lifespan of a running joke involving the nationality of Jamie's unseen dad, Woody Harrelson as the gay colleague of Dylan who always have innuendos offhand to share, Jenna Elfman who plays Dylan's sister and Richard Jenkins starring as Dylan's dad who's suffering from advancing Alzheimer's disease, which is especially poignant as it deals with the subplot of how a family copes with a loved one who's behaviour develops erratically, and holding the key to a pivotal personal experience to share and turn things around.\n\nWith Andy Samberg and Emma Stone making cameos (the latter being extremely crazy as a fanatical John Meyer fan), Friends With Benefits has its main leads to thank for in milking quite the cliché story for the masses, who are likely to make a beeline just to see those two in some down and dirty action, not that you get to see a lot to begin with anyway. Recommended, and stay tuned until after the end credits roll for more commentary when the two are sitting at a couch watching the outtakes of a DVD movie."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":352055,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-07-22","keywords":"female rear nudity,oral sex,blow job,no panties,male objectification","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2190056729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMzE4OTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM3NzY3NA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMzE4OTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM3NzY3NA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The relationship between two friends (Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis) gets complicated when they decide to get romantic.

A night out prior to the offer seals the LA based Dylan to relocate and take up the offer, with plenty of activities thrown in that if it's not Jamie being his only friend in a new, big city, they would serve as activities that would fit in for an awesome date night out. Before long they become firm friends, and made a pact to keep things physical since they each have their wants, and with the other party game to get down and dirty, so begins their game of tennis (though personally I prefer analogy with, and the term "bedminton" - it involves cocks after all). After all, why complicate what would be a beautiful friendship, if sex can be treated just as sex without the emotions thrown in to mess things up?\n\nYou know the clichéd drill by now, with things moving along fine and dandy, the hint of emotions coming into play to really turn things upside down, the narrative montage to show how frequent they mate like jackrabbits, before some large, needy episode or statements uttered that will probably reveal the true state of affairs, and the list goes on. Deny all you want, but one cannot help but to agree that the fairer sex will have things rough if pacts of this nature turn sour, and expectedly in a movie they always do, otherwise everyone will be happy without adversary, frustration and challenges to overcome and provide that change in strength of character.\n\nAnd it is this power of the cliché that absolutely calls the shots in films like these. You know what will happen, but want to see them happen anyway even though you're multiple steps ahead of every character. And it is precisely these expectations that anyone would want to see covered, and try as the filmmakers want it is the clichés that they find hard to break away from, even if characters here proclaim very early on that romance in their world shouldn't be like an unbelievable Hollywood film, but in what would be art imitating art, look who's talking to begin with. And what's with the fixation about consistently taking the shine off the captain of US Airways Flight 1549 in its emergency landing onto the Hudson River?\n\nJustin Timberlake is fast becoming the busy bona fide movie star since The Social Network, and continues his run with this film and In Time which will hit the screens here soon. He has that boyish charm that the camera just loves, and being a real life singer meant covering a number of songs here, from Stereophonics to Kris Kross made it look all too easy. Mila Kunis plays her role as the emotionally damaged girl with aplomb, and shares an effective chemistry with Timberlake that makes this film a delight to sit through, even if as mentioned the story's cliché and we know just about how these two nice looking people will likely get together. \n\nThe supporting characters while one dimensional almost always threaten to steal the show, from Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's sex crazed mom extending the lifespan of a running joke involving the nationality of Jamie's unseen dad, Woody Harrelson as the gay colleague of Dylan who always have innuendos offhand to share, Jenna Elfman who plays Dylan's sister and Richard Jenkins starring as Dylan's dad who's suffering from advancing Alzheimer's disease, which is especially poignant as it deals with the subplot of how a family copes with a loved one who's behaviour develops erratically, and holding the key to a pivotal personal experience to share and turn things around.\n\nWith Andy Samberg and Emma Stone making cameos (the latter being extremely crazy as a fanatical John Meyer fan), Friends With Benefits has its main leads to thank for in milking quite the cliché story for the masses, who are likely to make a beeline just to see those two in some down and dirty action, not that you get to see a lot to begin with anyway. Recommended, and stay tuned until after the end credits roll for more commentary when the two are sitting at a couch watching the outtakes of a DVD movie.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":352055,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-07-22","keywords":"female rear nudity,oral sex,blow job,no panties,male objectification","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2190056729","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMzE4OTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM3NzY3NA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMzE4OTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM3NzY3NA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The relationship between two friends (Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis) gets complicated when they decide to get romantic.

Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo were very well chosen for their roles.\n\nThe Mummy Returns is easy to see as being another sequel churned out to satiate the greedy money-machine that Hollywood has become, but it has a few things working for it. One thing that is immediately obvious is that the sequel was very much intended to be a film that could be enjoyed without ever having seen the original. The only references to the previous film are done to fill in the narrative gaps about who Imhotep is, and why he is the way he is. The addition of The Scorpion King was an interesting effort to give the film a new antagonist, but the lack of screentime didn't work well in this tangent's favour. Another tangent that could have been better developed was the rivalry between Imhotep's girlfriend and whatever her name was. Imhotep originally mistook Rachel Weisz's character for being his girlfriend reincarnated, so the use of a woman who looks exactly like her while creating this new tangent needed to be developed differently.\n\nMost people won't give a damn about complex story tangents and will want to know if this film is entertaining. And it is entertaining, alright. There is barely a dull moment in the film's substantial running length, and Oded Fehr does a bang-up job of providing a Mad-Max-cum-Indiana-Jones hero. I want to know where they get those groovy costumes and tattoos from, they look quite nice. Anyway, when all is said and done, this is an eight out of ten film. A few badly constructed story details here and there, but some extremely entertaining action sequences make up for them. Don't listen to the nay-sayers.

That sense of exhaustion from trying was clearly pervasive throughout the film, but the main character keeps chugging along and does not give in to the adversity he faces. To me, it created a compelling every day sort of comedy that was accessible and portrayed by fun characters.\n\nThere is some gratuitous nudity &amp; lewdness that detracts in some ways from the film, but being thick skinned, it really did not bother me at all. Bullying is a surface theme, but really it's "being there" for your fiends and family that is the real message and the bullying is sort of mentioned as a mechanism to show adversity and rising above it with the people we love. What's not to like about that? Bunch of "nose in the air" stiffs didn't get it, so what. \n\nVery watchable "b" comedy that does not try and over-achieve. Good movie for a quiet evening where you don't want to think too much. Anyone can highbrow this film and put it down, but it has tangible qualities that do not make it and idiotic "dumb &amp; dumber" type film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32965,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-04-08","keywords":"male nudity,business trip,company,glory hole,businessman","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1415687705","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MzkxOTAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgyMTg1NDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MzkxOTAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgyMTg1NDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A hard-working small business owner and his two associates travel to Europe to close the most important deal of their lives.

I saw the IMDb ratings, and set my expectations low, and then looked for the redeeming qualities of the film, sometimes that's all it takes to get more out of it than the high-expectation crowd.\n\nThe main character suffers one realistic defeat after another, and sometimes that's how life goes. That sense of exhaustion from trying was clearly pervasive throughout the film, but the main character keeps chugging along and does not give in to the adversity he faces. To me, it created a compelling every day sort of comedy that was accessible and portrayed by fun characters.\n\nThere is some gratuitous nudity &amp; lewdness that detracts in some ways from the film, but being thick skinned, it really did not bother me at all. Bullying is a surface theme, but really it's "being there" for your fiends and family that is the real message and the bullying is sort of mentioned as a mechanism to show adversity and rising above it with the people we love. What's not to like about that? Bunch of "nose in the air" stiffs didn't get it, so what. \n\nVery watchable "b" comedy that does not try and over-achieve. Good movie for a quiet evening where you don't want to think too much. Anyone can highbrow this film and put it down, but it has tangible qualities that do not make it and idiotic "dumb &amp; dumber" type film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32965,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-04-08","keywords":"male nudity,business trip,company,glory hole,businessman","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1415687705","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MzkxOTAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgyMTg1NDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MzkxOTAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgyMTg1NDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A hard-working small business owner and his two associates travel to Europe to close the most important deal of their lives.

It is probably on par with the Indiana Jones trilogy in terms of cheesy lines. But Brendan Fraser delivers these in a way that is so fitting that it does not really matter, to be honest. Fraser truly gets to shine and show us that is indeed best when it comes to comedy.\n\nThis isn't Citizen Kane, but it's NOT 'brainless' summer fun either.

Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Maybe the undead do not like the cold. He find himself trapped between various warring factions, including a ruthless CEO (Dennis Hopper) who offers safety to the wealthy while allowing the unwashed masses to fend for themselves, a fellow mercenary (John Leguizamo) who will sacrifice anyone to advance his own agenda, and hordes of zombies who are starting to take steps up the evolutionary ladder. They actually used a gun in this film. First time I've seen a zombie do more than eat. They even went in the water. Apes don't do that! Lots of blood, but there was less action than I've seen and more talking.\n\nI love John Leguizamo, and that made it worth my time. Seeing Asia Argento (xXx) wasn't bad either.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94382,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-08-24","keywords":"zombie apocalypse,post apocalypse,zombie film,zombie survival,survival horror","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Land of the Dead","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1419051289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODZhYWUxMDQtNWMzOC00ZjM2LWI2ZWEtNjliNzU5YjEwYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODZhYWUxMDQtNWMzOC00ZjM2LWI2ZWEtNjliNzU5YjEwYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000491/","name":"John Leguizamo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000782/","name":"Asia Argento","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048932/","name":"Simon Baker"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137674,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Gargamel abducted Smurfette because he wants to her to tell him the secret spell with which he can transform his newest creations "The Naughties" into real Smurfs. The Smurfs will team up with their human friends in order to rescue Smurfette before it will be too late.\n\nSince I had already watched the first movie I was expecting from the second to be better something that I thought it wouldn't be so difficult since the first was very bad. Unfortunately for one more time, I was disappointed because believe it or not this movie is even worse than the first one. I didn't like the whole concept of the movie, it was boring and with not any funny moments. The only thing that I liked it was the interpretations of Neil Patrick Harris who played as Patrick Winslow and Brendan Gleeson who played as Victor but in my opinion weren't enough to make this movie more interesting or watchable. Regarding the direction which was made once more by Raja Gosnell was average and worse than the first.\n\nTo sum up, "The Smurfs 2" is a poor movie with not many good or funny scenes, average direction and in comparison with the first movie I have to say that this was even worse. I don't recommend anyone to watch this movie because I believe that you are going to waste your time and I am sure that you won't like it at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-09-11","keywords":"based on cartoon,sequel,new york city,3 dimensional,live action cgi hybrid","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2897651993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQxNjNiZGUtM2RlMC00YWE4LWE2ODItMDZlODAzNzc0MGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQxNjNiZGUtM2RlMC00YWE4LWE2ODItMDZlODAzNzc0MGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Smurfs team up with their human friends to rescue Smurfette, who has been kidnapped by Gargamel since she knows a secret spell that can turn the evil sorcerer's newest creation - creatures called the Naughties - into real Smurfs."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000439/","name":"Neil Patrick Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1724323/","name":"Jayma Mays"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2953537/","name":"Katy Perry"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0331532/","name":"Raja Gosnell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0121181/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0316575/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826425/","name":"J.

Gargamel abducted Smurfette because he wants to her to tell him the secret spell with which he can transform his newest creations "The Naughties" into real Smurfs. The Smurfs will team up with their human friends in order to rescue Smurfette before it will be too late.\n\nSince I had already watched the first movie I was expecting from the second to be better something that I thought it wouldn't be so difficult since the first was very bad. Unfortunately for one more time, I was disappointed because believe it or not this movie is even worse than the first one. I didn't like the whole concept of the movie, it was boring and with not any funny moments. The only thing that I liked it was the interpretations of Neil Patrick Harris who played as Patrick Winslow and Brendan Gleeson who played as Victor but in my opinion weren't enough to make this movie more interesting or watchable. Regarding the direction which was made once more by Raja Gosnell was average and worse than the first.\n\nTo sum up, "The Smurfs 2" is a poor movie with not many good or funny scenes, average direction and in comparison with the first movie I have to say that this was even worse. I don't recommend anyone to watch this movie because I believe that you are going to waste your time and I am sure that you won't like it at all.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39967,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-09-11","keywords":"based on cartoon,sequel,new york city,3 dimensional,live action cgi hybrid","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2897651993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQxNjNiZGUtM2RlMC00YWE4LWE2ODItMDZlODAzNzc0MGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQxNjNiZGUtM2RlMC00YWE4LWE2ODItMDZlODAzNzc0MGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Smurfs team up with their human friends to rescue Smurfette, who has been kidnapped by Gargamel since she knows a secret spell that can turn the evil sorcerer's newest creation - creatures called the Naughties - into real Smurfs.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000439/","name":"Neil Patrick Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1724323/","name":"Jayma Mays","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2953537/","name":"Katy Perry"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0331532/","name":"Raja Gosnell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0121181/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0316575/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826425/","name":"J.

Yes.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future. Hopefully I can better describe the feeling it gives me when I do.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

Yes.\n\nI absolutely loved this movie! As 3 friends come to the end of their senior year. Quentin (played by Nat Wolff) sets out on an adventure likes he's never had before. There is very little that disappointed me in this film. As a matter of fact, my only real complaint was the character of Margo (played by Cara Delevingne), I can't quite put my finger on it but i found her character to be annoying throughout the first act. She was very monotone although she had this opinionated know it all attitude. \n\nHowever, since most of the film after that is about finding Margo, her character is not a problem anymore. I realize that the genre of the film is "Drama, Mystery, Romance", I think it is safe to add Adventure , Comedy to the mix. This film made good on the mystery of Margo while adding the adventure of the night before she goes missing along with the adventure that Quentin embarks throughout this entire film looking for Margo. I also found the movie to be very funny with best friends like Radar (played by Justice Smith) and Ben (played by Ben Abrams). These two have completely different characters from one another but together make for a great and funny friendship. Much comedic relief comes from the interaction of the two best friends alone and the scenes where it's all three of them.\n\nI liked the cinematography in this film very much. There were pretty lens flares that I thought were suitable for this type of film and in the scenes that they used them. There was something about the slow motion car shots that I loved as well. A good use of shallow depth of field to concentrate on solely one character at times and no shots that were visually a distraction that I noticed.\n\nI loved all the music that they put into the film. This was a definite plus for me.\n\nLastly, I love the message of this film. A young man graduating from high school with his whole future planned (college, marriage, kids, career) only to realize that life is more than just those things. That you can have an adventure through it all and that friends are so important and that you need to cherish friendships and enjoy them to the fullest before everyone goes their separate ways. This is a movie that I would recommend anyone watch. Live life to the fullest, have an adventure and don't let life pass you by. I am definitely planning on watching this film again in the near future. Hopefully I can better describe the feeling it gives me when I do.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

When this sequel was released, I was impressed with the number of stars and locations mostly in Europe, and certainly a huge budget. Unfortunately, this movie does not have the most relevant component: a decent screenplay. The beginning is confused and most of the situations and dialogs are not funny, being indeed ridiculous; when the execution of the heist is disclosed in the end, it is ludicrous; and the absurd plot itself is totally unbelievable and does not work.

When this sequel was released, I was impressed with the number of stars and locations mostly in Europe, and certainly a huge budget. Unfortunately, this movie does not have the most relevant component: a decent screenplay. The beginning is confused and most of the situations and dialogs are not funny, being indeed ridiculous; when the execution of the heist is disclosed in the end, it is ludicrous; and the absurd plot itself is totally unbelievable and does not work. The direction is also very bad, with horrible and weird movements of camera.

There was also the interest to see how Lady Gaga would fare in her acting debut and how Bradley Cooper would fare as first-time director. Decided to see it when taking a break from practise with nothing else better to do, going in with very high expectations, as part of my "seeing as many 2018 films as possible" quest.\n\nThis is not the only, or first, 'A Star is Born' film. There is one from 1937 with Mitzi Gaynor and Fredric March, my personal favourite. There is one from 1954, the most famous, which is overlong but does contain Judy Garland's best ever performance and terrific songs (especially the heart-wrenching "The Man That Got Away"), love James Mason in it too. There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and "Evergreen" is to die for.\n\nAs far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.\n\nIt's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.\n\nThe final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.\n\nWhat 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.\n\nVisually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as "The Man That Got Away" and "Evergreen" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. "I'll Never Love Again" and "Shallow" stand out.\n\nDialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.\n\nAltogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":355027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-05","keywords":"alcoholism,tinnitus,rising star,singer songwriter,singer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi94288665","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","description":"A movie star helps a young singer and actress find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605792/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744839/","name":"Eric Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3391497/","name":"Will Fetters"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So there is no substitution of characters, we actually witness the lion and the two kids growing up.\n\nMia lives with her dad, mom, and brother on a farm in South Africa, primarily raising then selling animals that otherwise would be in the wild. Like lions. One day dad brings home this tiny, cute white lion cub, and they call him Charlie. At first Mia is annoyed with the cub, wants him to leave her alone, but they eventually bond.\n\nWhen Charlie is about to be sold Mia finds out the actual fate of most of the "trophy" animals, they are sold to become targets of big game hunters in a captive environment, still a legal activity in South Africa. Mia decides to take drastic action to try and save Charlie from that fate.\n\nThere is a good "extra" on the disc telling about the process and what had to be done to train the lion to become the young actress' friend and not eat her."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4854,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2018-12-24","keywords":"singing in a car,girl lion relationship,animal in title,pet lion,white lion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3207183129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0MjZiYWEtZGRkOC00ZjEzLTg4OTUtYzRjNzFhNGFmZjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0MjZiYWEtZGRkOC00ZjEzLTg4OTUtYzRjNzFhNGFmZjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7444538/","name":"Daniah De Villiers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0491259/","name":"Mélanie Laurent"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456810/","name":"Langley Kirkwood"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537923/","name":"Gilles de Maistre"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058643/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0461578/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049118/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7444537/","name":"Prune de Maistre"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204030/","name":"William Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537923/","name":"Gilles de Maistre"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So there is no substitution of characters, we actually witness the lion and the two kids growing up.\n\nMia lives with her dad, mom, and brother on a farm in South Africa, primarily raising then selling animals that otherwise would be in the wild. Like lions. One day dad brings home this tiny, cute white lion cub, and they call him Charlie. At first Mia is annoyed with the cub, wants him to leave her alone, but they eventually bond.\n\nWhen Charlie is about to be sold Mia finds out the actual fate of most of the "trophy" animals, they are sold to become targets of big game hunters in a captive environment, still a legal activity in South Africa. Mia decides to take drastic action to try and save Charlie from that fate.\n\nThere is a good "extra" on the disc telling about the process and what had to be done to train the lion to become the young actress' friend and not eat her.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4854,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2018-12-24","keywords":"singing in a car,girl lion relationship,animal in title,pet lion,white lion","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3207183129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0MjZiYWEtZGRkOC00ZjEzLTg4OTUtYzRjNzFhNGFmZjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0MjZiYWEtZGRkOC00ZjEzLTg4OTUtYzRjNzFhNGFmZjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7444538/","name":"Daniah De Villiers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0491259/","name":"Mélanie Laurent","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456810/","name":"Langley Kirkwood"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537923/","name":"Gilles de Maistre"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058643/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0461578/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049118/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7444537/","name":"Prune de Maistre","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204030/","name":"William Davies","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537923/","name":"Gilles de Maistre"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This film along with SIDE EFFECTS are purported to be Steven Soderbergh's last films he will direct.\n\nThe cast is very solid. Matt Damon embodies the role of Scott Thorson well - a young apparently bisexual man who has been tossed from foster home to foster home while he does odd jobs (he is 17 years old) tending to animals. In a gay bar he meets Bob Black (Scott Bakula) who takes Scott to a Liberace concert (his first exposure to the mega-star) and to meet Liberace afterwards. There is tension in the air with Liberace's current paramour and performing partner Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne Jackson) and we soon discover that Liberace (impeccably played by Michael Douglas) only keeps his 'boys' around for a while before his manager Seymour (Dan Ackroyd) gets rid of them with a check. Liberace and Scott find common ground in being needy people without confidants and soon Scott becomes Liberace's next lover. All goes swimmingly until Liberace sees himself on a TV show and sees how aged he has become. He engages plastic surgeon Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe in a very fine performance) to perform a youthful face lift and at the same time convinces Scott to undergo plastic surgery to make him look more like Liberace! And here begins the downfall: Dr. Startz prescribes pain meds to Scott who becomes addicted and moves into heavier drugs, and his behavior, along with Liberace's need for a 'new face' (Boyd Holbrook), signals the breakup of a 6 year relationship - the best relationship either has ever had.\n\nThere are excellent cameos by Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother, Paul Reiser as Scott's lawyer, and others, but the star of the film is in all ways the flamboyant showman Liberace in some of the most interesting outfits ever created. The on screen relationship between Michael Douglas and Matt Damon is entirely credible and neither of these fine actors has a problem with being sexually physical without seeming to be a parody. There are moments that could have been cut, but as Liberace says, less is more and more is wonderful. \n\nGrady Harp"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42164,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2013-05-26","keywords":"pianist,gay adoption,boy toy,gay relationship,based on real person","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi510240281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMDc4NTM2OTFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA2NTYxNjk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMDc4NTM2OTFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA2NTYxNjk@._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on the autobiographical novel, the tempestuous 6-year relationship between Liberace and his (much younger) lover, Scott Thorson, is recounted.

The follow-up and Vaughn's first sequel has enough of what 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' so good and is an entertaining film on its own but at the end of the day it feels like something is missing.\n\nLike some have said already, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle's' biggest flaw is the length, at nearly two and a half hours (much longer than the first film, which was just over two hours) it does feel too long by about 20-25 minutes or so and it does affect the pacing, which drags in place.\n\nEspecially when it tries to cram in a lot, not everything feels necessary and some of the narrative is on the flimsy and not quite as eventful side. For example Eggsy's excursion to Glastonbury did feel dragged out and didn't serve as much point to the story as it could have done. The first film had more content but wasn't bloated and everything served a point.\n\nAs enjoyable as the climax was, Poppy's defeat did feel anti-climactic, and Halle Berry is fairly wasted, as is Channing Tatum in what is essentially a pointless plot device role.\n\nHowever, like 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' has a huge amount to enjoy. It is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes and audacious production design, if just lacking the operatic grandeur of the first film in the action. Once again, the soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.\n\nVaughn does well on the whole directing, particularly on the stylistic elements and making the action as fun as possible. He does struggle maintaining narrative momentum at times however. Very like the first film, he not just achieves the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing, but but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things.\n\nAction-wise, 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' is fun, especially a nod to the original's bar brawl, the snow gun fight, the opening and the deliciously bonkers climax. At the same, nothing is in the same league as the unforgettable church scene and they lack the unflinching grimness. Here, when it comes to the script, nothing leaves a bad taste in the mouth, it is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar, at times, and very witty (like the culture-clash elements), with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny moments. One does wish that the pacing was tighter and the story more consistently gripping.\n\nRegarding the cast, they are top notch. Colin Firth returns and does a phenomenal job playing against type, Taron Egerton isn't quite as likable as in the original but one is engrossed enough in his journey (the Glastonbury excursion could easily have been trimmed) and Mark Strong has the ability to turn beneath-him material into gold and he is as charismatic as ever. Pedro Pascal has a Burt Reynolds vibe to him and it comes over affectionately and amusingly.\n\nOne has to credit Julianne Moore as an understated but played with relish villain and Jeff Bridges once again showing how fine an actor he is. Was pleasantly surprised by Elton John, appreciate him as a singer and his importance in rock 'n' roll but was admittedly expecting him to be a mugging disaster but he sends himself up to scene-stealing entertaining effect.\n\nIn conclusion, a fun if inferior sequel where one can see why it has garnered fairly mixed reviews but still better than given credit for. 7/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":291095,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-09-20","keywords":"fighting,one against many,man cut in half,spy,sequel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi734968089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTYyYTE2MjgtMDNkMi00NGYyLTg3MjYtZjBiNGJkN2VmMGE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTYyYTE2MjgtMDNkMi00NGYyLTg3MjYtZjBiNGJkN2VmMGE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When their headquarters are destroyed and the world is held hostage, the Kingsman's journey leads them to the discovery of an allied spy organization in the US.

    <desc lang="hr">Wallace i njegov pas Gromit započeli su potpuno novi posao - pekarnicu "Top Bun". No postoji jedan problem - ostali lokalni pekari u gradu nestaju jedan po jedan... Je li Wallace sljedeći na redu? Wallace i Gromit započeli su novi posao pečenja kruha, "Top Bun", i pretvorili svoju kuću u Ulici West Wallaby 62 u žitnicu s peći, robotskim rukama za miješenje i staromodnom vjetrenjačom na krovu. Transformacija je savršena. Iako posao cvjeta, Gromit je zabrinut zbog vijesti da je desetak lokalnih pekara "nestalo" ove godine - ali Wallace se ne brine. On je previše rastresen i zaljubljen u bivšu ljepoticu i krušnu entuzijasticu, Piellu Bakewell. Dok oni uživaju, Gromit ubrzo shvaća da je život njegova gospodara u opasnosti te postaje detektiv kako bi riješio misteriozni slučaj u onome što ubrzo postaje "pitanje kruha i života".</desc>

I had high expectations, was hoping for a decent sci-fi movie but instead I got a quite boring drama. I wouldn't say the actors were bad, far from that, Natalie Portman and the rest did their job, but the story was just weak, certainly for the first half of the movie. The movie was also much too long, certainly for the story they wanted to tell. I wouldn't waste too much time on this one if I were you.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-10-04","keywords":"astronaut,close up of eye,multiple aspect ratios,character name in title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing Only In Theaters","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2276769561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhjNDUxYWItMjkzOC00OWNlLTk2MzItOTRjMjMzMGJlZDhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhjNDUxYWItMjkzOC00OWNlLTk2MzItOTRjMjMzMGJlZDhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Astronaut Lucy Cola's space mission leaves her deeply moved by the experience of seeing her life from afar.

A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook! ....................................\n\nShame on me for ignoring my own rule of thumb and slurping up so many of the gushing reviews for Wall-E. My expectation was somewhere around Pluto, but this only managed to take me to Saturn. Normally, Saturn would warrant a rave review, but not when a film falls somewhat short of that ever-so-high bar you've set for it! Don't get me wrong. Pixar has hit a home run with Wall-E. They just did not hit one out of the park, as so many others would have you believe.\n\nThe movie really does work on just about every imaginable level. The Pixar animation team most certainly outdid themselves, taking CGI to an impressive and breathtakingly realistic new level for 2008. Wall-E is, at times thought-provoking, ironic, laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, entertaining, and perhaps, somewhat romantic. Yes, all of this with a highly original story line and offbeat musical accompaniment. Those elements which are borrowed from other movies are at least incorporated with a fresh twist.\n\nWall-E most definitely has its shortcomings: A little over the top at times in the "Gee, aren't we just the cutest on screen Bots you've ever seen?" Department. There are also a couple occasions where the substitution of dialog for assorted sound effects becomes a bit tedious.\n\nFortunately, the movie is very low key as regards the results of long term ravaging of the environment, not at all in-your-face as so often is the case with movies made in the recent years. Taken as a whole, though, Wall-E deserves between 8 and 8 1/2*. In any case, please, simply put aside the reviews and just watch Wall-E, hopefully, leaving your expectations behind. You'll probably have a very enjoyable and entertaining 90 minutes.\n\n8* STARS*...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!\n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1041476,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"robot,obesity,recycling robot,adrift in space,cgi animation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wall E","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192703769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njc2MTYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njc2MTYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Wall E - Trailer #3"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123785/","name":"Ben Burtt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2264184/","name":"Elissa Knight"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307531/","name":"Jeff Garlin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0622634/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714114/","name":"Jim Reardon"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook! ....................................\n\nShame on me for ignoring my own rule of thumb and slurping up so many of the gushing reviews for Wall-E. My expectation was somewhere around Pluto, but this only managed to take me to Saturn. Normally, Saturn would warrant a rave review, but not when a film falls somewhat short of that ever-so-high bar you've set for it! Don't get me wrong. Pixar has hit a home run with Wall-E. They just did not hit one out of the park, as so many others would have you believe.\n\nThe movie really does work on just about every imaginable level. The Pixar animation team most certainly outdid themselves, taking CGI to an impressive and breathtakingly realistic new level for 2008. Wall-E is, at times thought-provoking, ironic, laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, entertaining, and perhaps, somewhat romantic. Yes, all of this with a highly original story line and offbeat musical accompaniment. Those elements which are borrowed from other movies are at least incorporated with a fresh twist.\n\nWall-E most definitely has its shortcomings: A little over the top at times in the "Gee, aren't we just the cutest on screen Bots you've ever seen?" Department. There are also a couple occasions where the substitution of dialog for assorted sound effects becomes a bit tedious.\n\nFortunately, the movie is very low key as regards the results of long term ravaging of the environment, not at all in-your-face as so often is the case with movies made in the recent years. Taken as a whole, though, Wall-E deserves between 8 and 8 1/2*. In any case, please, simply put aside the reviews and just watch Wall-E, hopefully, leaving your expectations behind. You'll probably have a very enjoyable and entertaining 90 minutes.\n\n8* STARS*...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!\n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1041476,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"robot,obesity,recycling robot,adrift in space,cgi animation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wall E","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192703769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njc2MTYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2Njc2MTYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Wall E - Trailer #3","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123785/","name":"Ben Burtt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2264184/","name":"Elissa Knight","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307531/","name":"Jeff Garlin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0622634/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004056/","name":"Andrew Stanton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714114/","name":"Jim Reardon"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The sets were stunning - the actors were first rate - the effects were breathtaking.  The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen, never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with.   The screenplay, by Steven Kloves, stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story.  Though many events from the book were excluded, the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable movie-going experience.\n\nMany kudos to Chris Columbus and the rest of the Harry Potter cast/crew for not turning this movie into what it easily could have become:  a 2 and a half hour commercial advertisement for action figures and collectibles, kid's meals and fast food tie-ins, soft drinks and snack products, etc. and instead focused on bringing J.K. Rowling's story to life as accurately and as lovingly as it deserves.  There has been much speculation on whether Columbus was the correct choice for the first two installments of the series and I say to that, Yes.  I feel that he accomplished what most would have failed.  He has proven, at least to me, that Diagon Alley truly exists - if only I could find the right brick to tap on.  The world of Harry Potter is no longer fantasy to me, but instead a place where any of us mere Muggles could hope to visit, one day.\n\nOne of my favorite moments, is what I'm going to refer to as the Adrenaline Sequence.  By Adrenaline Sequence, I mean the sequence in a movie that for all intents and purposes, doesn't necessarily propel the story, but gives the audience a huge theatrical payoff, ala the Pod Race sequence in The Phantom Menace.  The Adrenaline Sequence for this particular movie is the Quidditch sequence.  I was very happy to finally see the 'hockey/soccer hybrid on a broomstick' come to life.  The Quidditch Sequence is, by far, my favorite sequence in the whole film.  The scene is dizzying in it's violence and it's one breathless moment after another.  My hat goes off to Columbus and his team for succeeding in making this scene as memorable as it should be.\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic movie for children of all ages.

Serija "Na tuđem kauču", koju je osmislio i u kojoj glumi komičar Pete Holmes, vraća se na HBO s trećom sezonom. Serija je nadahnuta Holmesovim osobnim iskustvima kao komičara te pruža suptilan i urnebesan pogled u današnje stanje komedije. U ovoj je sezoni Pete pun energije te više ne spava na tuđim kaučima i ponovno ulazi u svijet njujorške stand-up komedije. No iako se poboljšao, to ne znači da je glavna faca u gradu. Dok nastavlja kružiti oko komičarke i bivše cure Ali, povezuje se s Kat koja ima jedinstven pogled na svijet komedije i ne pokušava se proslaviti pričanjem viceva. Pete je svakim nastupom sve bliže uspjehu te nastavlja usklađivati vjeru i izlaske i navigirati kroz stalno mijenjajuću komičarsku scenu.</desc>

The vacationers include the Mossbacher family - Nicole (Connie Britton), a successful type-A exec, who can't help but treat her family like disobedient employees; her husband, Mark (Steve Zahn), dealing with both an embarrassing health crisis and a terminal inferiority complex; their teenaged son, Quinn (Fred Hechinger), a socially awkward gamer, experiencing the wonder of nature for the very first time; their daughter, Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), and her friend, Paula (Brittany O'Grady), sharp-tongued college sophomores who cast a sardonic eye on the lifestyles and belief systems of everyone around them.  The handsome, entitled Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) is here with his beautiful bride, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario).  Shane and Rachel are in the throes of young love, but as they get to know each other better in this new, intimate environment, clouds of doubt appear - and by the time Shane's intrusive mother, Kitty (Molly Shannon) surprises them with an unwelcome visit, their fairytale honeymoon has begun to unravel. And finally, there is Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge), a wealthy, unstable woman, recovering from the death of her mother, traveling alone to the hotel, looking for love and in desperate need of a massage."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sinister mystery of Hogwarts.","reviewBody":""... The magical power that came to Joan Rowling from a different world, pulls for itself, and the book is read in one breath." Book Review, December 18, 2000\n\nThe second book about the adventures of the young wizard Harry Potter world waited impatiently. And finally, he waited. "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" appears before the reader's eyes with a bright and original work. Of course, it relies on the first book, but it remains individual. "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - a darker and more terrible book, unlike the first. So became the film. But the film and the book have not lost their charm and easy immediacy. It's still the same kind of fairy tale about the fight between good and evil, where good will certainly win.\n\nThe magical world of Harry Potter has not changed. All the same oblique streets of London, the splendor of Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest with its secret inhabitants, The slanting alley, the eerie Lute Lane, the unfriendly Rattling Willow, the huge school yard, the stunning quidditch. All this was preserved and was moved by magic wave in the second film, only slightly transformed. Hogwarts is a bright and active participant in all events. This castle, which became home for Harry, is no less important character than our young hero. Hogwarts carries in itself tying knowledge and great wisdom. This huge, majestic building knew a lot in its time. And all its secrets, its architecture and attract the eye.\n\nIn "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" we meet the amazing and frightening creatures of the magical world. Dobby's elf is very cute and funny. In such a small, frail body is hidden a wide soul, suffering in vain. He does his best to protect Harry from danger. But Harry Potter, like a magnet, attracts them. Favorite animal Hagrid turns into an unpleasant monster - a giant giant spider Aragog. He is wise, old, but does not inspire confidence. And on top of everything, the mighty, dangerous serpent Basilisk appears on the screen. There are many legends about this snake, and Joan Rowling decided to add it to her epic. And, in principle, not in vain. He inspires reverence and horror, but at the same time a frank desire for Harry to finish him off quickly. Another amazing character in the film is Phoenix Fawkes. Amazing bird flown from the pages of the book to the screen. She is an ancient mythical creature, dying and rising from the ashes. It reminds us of the eternal cycle of life and death. Special effects in the film, in other ways, as in the first, not at altitude. But even seeing a few implausible spiders and a snake, you believe everything that is happening on the screen. The magical, mysterious, magical and frankly amazing world of Harry Potter draws and you just do not want to return to reality. Chris Columbus, who became the director of the Potters for the second time, could not lose the charm and atmosphere of the first film. Just the movie "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" became more sinister, frightening and full of dangers.\n\nCharacters have not changed. Bright, alive, emotionally embodied on the screen of their heroes magnificent English actors. The cold and tough Potions master Severus Snegg performed by Alan Rickman, the same adamant Minerva McGonagall, the wise director of the Hogwarts School Albus Dumbledore (the eternal memory of Richard Harris, who died three weeks before the premiere of the film), the kind-hearted forester Hagrid. Pleased with new characters. Lucius Malfoy performed by Jason Isaacs is cruel, adamant. It just blows something negative and extremely unpleasant. Zlatopust Lokons is the life-builder, reclining on the laurels of others. He turned out to be too sugary, pretty, I would even say sugary. And, undoubtedly, the actor Kenneth Bran is on top. His character, or rather his performance, is very ironic. The unchanged trio of the main characters remained the same. Harry Potter is the star of the magical world, the orphan boy, who grew up in disgusting muggles, displays remarkable courage, desperation and determination. The one with which courage he rushes into battle, you can just envy. I'm torn by internal contradictions, his similarity with Lord Voldemort, his knowledge of the snake tongue. He is afraid of all this. And Harry desperately tries to understand himself. But when you need to become a hero, he is ready for this, because he is a hero in the full sense of the word. He is ready to give his own life for others. Is this not the highest manifestation of heroism? But Harry does not boast of it. And this is a huge plus to his character.\n\n"I'm sure that Mr. Potter will always be there to save us." - "Certainly." Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter.\n\nRon Weasley remained absolutely the same except for the character. He transformed, becoming better. His behavior towards Hermione, when she was insulted by Draco, calling her a Mudblood, his courage in the Forbidden Forest among not one hundred spiders, whom he fears until his death, causes respect and approval.\n\nHermione Granger is still the same smart girl with a lively mind and a great intellect. She is very natural and sincerely wants to help others. With her character there are certain metamorphoses. Hermione clearly ceases to be such an avid guardian of order.\n\n"We are badly influenced by it." Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Tom Narvolo Reddle is the past of the cruelest magician of the magical world of Lord Volan de Mort. This character is interesting with his striking resemblance to Harry. They are like halves of one whole. Harry has collected all the good and positive, in Voldemort everything is bad and negative. They are very similar, but they are very different. The choice. That's what makes Harry the way he is and distinguishes him from a dark magician. Choosing Harry to live the life he wants. His choice.\n\n"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" - a magical, mysterious, full of magic, amazing and terrible creatures canvas director Chris Columbus. For the second time we stepped into this unique world full of mysteries and terrible discoveries. Music, Gothic entourage, Hogwarts and unchanging heroes in the fight against evil: welcome to the magical world of Harry Potter, created by the hand of a fabulous storyteller Joan Rowling.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":580877,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-01-15","keywords":"invisibility cloak,sequel,wizard,basilisk,killing a monster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1705771289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZjNhNjYtODhjOC00NjlkLWE4MTItMDhiOGVmZmIwOWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001060/","name":"Chris Columbus"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

Serija "Na tuđem kauču", koju je osmislio i u kojoj glumi komičar Pete Holmes, vraća se na HBO s trećom sezonom. Serija je nadahnuta Holmesovim osobnim iskustvima kao komičara te pruža suptilan i urnebesan pogled u današnje stanje komedije. U ovoj je sezoni Pete pun energije te više ne spava na tuđim kaučima i ponovno ulazi u svijet njujorške stand-up komedije. No iako se poboljšao, to ne znači da je glavna faca u gradu. Dok nastavlja kružiti oko komičarke i bivše cure Ali, povezuje se s Kat koja ima jedinstven pogled na svijet komedije i ne pokušava se proslaviti pričanjem viceva. Pete je svakim nastupom sve bliže uspjehu te nastavlja usklađivati vjeru i izlaske i navigirati kroz stalno mijenjajuću komičarsku scenu.</desc>

Beautiful. Human.","reviewBody":"Good god, what is wrong with producers when they think this movie isn't worth making? China needs to get over itself and the US needs to stop being so friggin' and closed-minded with what people want to see in their theaters.\n\nThis story is absolutely deserving of an audience, and combines together through a beautiful lens a clashing of Western &amp; Eastern philosophies of life that really should be examined.\n\nAmericans have an idea of preserving one's independence and pressing back against being a cog in a machine, while China embraces being a cog and working together to ensure each other's safety and well-being. Both are philosophies that deserve meditation, and this movie does just that, while centering it around the touching story in the center between a grandmother and her family.\n\nI cannot give this movie enough praise. Each moment, each shot, each sound, each setting, each performance-- all orchestrated together seamlessly, giving the viewer an impartially guided experience full of subtle subtext and nuance that, if it doesn't get caught by the viewer, they at least get a gorgeous shot to enjoy.\n\nI was hesitant to give this movie ten stars, as I typically reserve that for movies that I would undoubtedly purchase and watch on repeat, but I could see myself watching this again and being in the mood for its ride. It's a bittersweet odyssey that dips and rises multiple times through darkness and light, all the while keeping you comforted with humor and grace-- almost like a grandmother should.\n\nTen stars for The Farewell. I will visit it again and again as I would my grandmother."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57094,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-09","keywords":"cemetery,doctor,grief,lie,secret","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1239464985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJkYjY1OGYtZGFjMy00ZDkyLTg2OWItMzRmYTc5MzE5MzgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJkYjY1OGYtZGFjMy00ZDkyLTg2OWItMzRmYTc5MzE5MzgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Chinese family discover their grandmother has only a short while left to live and decide to keep her in the dark, scheduling a wedding to gather before she dies.

Beautiful. Human.","reviewBody":"Good god, what is wrong with producers when they think this movie isn't worth making? China needs to get over itself and the US needs to stop being so friggin' and closed-minded with what people want to see in their theaters.\n\nThis story is absolutely deserving of an audience, and combines together through a beautiful lens a clashing of Western &amp; Eastern philosophies of life that really should be examined.\n\nAmericans have an idea of preserving one's independence and pressing back against being a cog in a machine, while China embraces being a cog and working together to ensure each other's safety and well-being. Both are philosophies that deserve meditation, and this movie does just that, while centering it around the touching story in the center between a grandmother and her family.\n\nI cannot give this movie enough praise. Each moment, each shot, each sound, each setting, each performance-- all orchestrated together seamlessly, giving the viewer an impartially guided experience full of subtle subtext and nuance that, if it doesn't get caught by the viewer, they at least get a gorgeous shot to enjoy.\n\nI was hesitant to give this movie ten stars, as I typically reserve that for movies that I would undoubtedly purchase and watch on repeat, but I could see myself watching this again and being in the mood for its ride. It's a bittersweet odyssey that dips and rises multiple times through darkness and light, all the while keeping you comforted with humor and grace-- almost like a grandmother should.\n\nTen stars for The Farewell. I will visit it again and again as I would my grandmother.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57094,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-09","keywords":"cemetery,doctor,grief,lie,secret","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1239464985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJkYjY1OGYtZGFjMy00ZDkyLTg2OWItMzRmYTc5MzE5MzgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJkYjY1OGYtZGFjMy00ZDkyLTg2OWItMzRmYTc5MzE5MzgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Chinese family discover their grandmother has only a short while left to live and decide to keep her in the dark, scheduling a wedding to gather before she dies.

Give TWISTER another chance! Films, even action films, don't HAVE to have "an inventive plot" or "decent performances" or "a script that wasn't written by a machine" to be "good." All I need is light, noise, and lotsa 'splosions! Take those elements and paste over a thin layer of worn-out story borrowed from 10 or twelve other movies and you got a winner, thank you! Throw in some great acting-Bill Paxton's "staring at the dirt" moment alone FLOORS me. And ever notice how Helen Hunt is constantly bustling about with her head down whenever she's not scrunching her face into her patented "I'm sad and cute" look (Hello Oscar!)-that's ACTING! And Jamie Gertz! Welcome back to the cinema! I haven't seen you since LISTEN TO ME! And don't even get me started on the lovable ragamuffins known as the "storm chasers"! The way they're thrown at us like we'll immediately love them! The way you're not sure how many of them there are! (And the fat red-hared "dude"! That's what they mean by COOL! I mean COOL-AGE!) And Cary Elwes! What a great villian! He's in it for the money!(Hsss!) At first I wasn't sure what accent he was doing, since it changed every scene, but then I realized he was doing all of them! And the F/X! WOWWW!!! This movie follows the rule "We got a computer, who needs a script?". I love how the characters "find" the big tornado in the end-on a perfectly sunny day, no less-and drive right up to it with no damage done! I can't wait to try that myself! (I just hope I have lots of cans of delicious refreshing Pepsi-Cola(TM)!!!)\n\nTo sum up, this is a rollercoaster wrapped inside a thrillride of a movie and I implore you to give a second chance! Please don't get hung up on this notion that a big budget action film could actually be daring and original and even a little smart. All we need are CGIs and THX sound and films made by the marketing department of the studios to keep us happy! Give me more! I'm waiting!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186536,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1996-05-10","keywords":"crashing a car into a house,drive in theater,drive in movie,storm chaser,disaster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Twister","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2145386777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTc2MTEzMDAtOGVmNS00MjYxLWFiZWMtYTkwMmFkYjk5OGUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTc2MTEzMDAtOGVmNS00MjYxLWFiZWMtYTkwMmFkYjk5OGUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000166/","name":"Helen Hunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000200/","name":"Bill Paxton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000144/","name":"Cary Elwes"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000957/","name":"Jan de Bont"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000341/","name":"Michael Crichton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0551926/","name":"Anne-Marie Martin"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Give TWISTER another chance! Films, even action films, don't HAVE to have "an inventive plot" or "decent performances" or "a script that wasn't written by a machine" to be "good." All I need is light, noise, and lotsa 'splosions! Take those elements and paste over a thin layer of worn-out story borrowed from 10 or twelve other movies and you got a winner, thank you! Throw in some great acting-Bill Paxton's "staring at the dirt" moment alone FLOORS me. And ever notice how Helen Hunt is constantly bustling about with her head down whenever she's not scrunching her face into her patented "I'm sad and cute" look (Hello Oscar!)-that's ACTING! And Jamie Gertz! Welcome back to the cinema! I haven't seen you since LISTEN TO ME! And don't even get me started on the lovable ragamuffins known as the "storm chasers"! The way they're thrown at us like we'll immediately love them! The way you're not sure how many of them there are! (And the fat red-hared "dude"! That's what they mean by COOL! I mean COOL-AGE!) And Cary Elwes! What a great villian! He's in it for the money!(Hsss!) At first I wasn't sure what accent he was doing, since it changed every scene, but then I realized he was doing all of them! And the F/X! WOWWW!!! This movie follows the rule "We got a computer, who needs a script?". I love how the characters "find" the big tornado in the end-on a perfectly sunny day, no less-and drive right up to it with no damage done! I can't wait to try that myself! (I just hope I have lots of cans of delicious refreshing Pepsi-Cola(TM)!!!)\n\nTo sum up, this is a rollercoaster wrapped inside a thrillride of a movie and I implore you to give a second chance! Please don't get hung up on this notion that a big budget action film could actually be daring and original and even a little smart. All we need are CGIs and THX sound and films made by the marketing department of the studios to keep us happy! Give me more! I'm waiting!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186536,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1996-05-10","keywords":"crashing a car into a house,drive in theater,drive in movie,storm chaser,disaster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Twister","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2145386777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTc2MTEzMDAtOGVmNS00MjYxLWFiZWMtYTkwMmFkYjk5OGUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTc2MTEzMDAtOGVmNS00MjYxLWFiZWMtYTkwMmFkYjk5OGUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000166/","name":"Helen Hunt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000200/","name":"Bill Paxton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000144/","name":"Cary Elwes"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000957/","name":"Jan de Bont"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000341/","name":"Michael Crichton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0551926/","name":"Anne-Marie Martin"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
